Nominations and applications for Candidates came to a close Sunday, January 13, 2019, and the [Campaign Phase](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election#Phase_1:_Campaign) of the [2018-2019 openSUSE Board Elections](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election) kicked in Monday, January 14, with a seventh impressive Candidate,** [Marina Latini aka deneb_alpha](https://en.opensuse.org/User:Deneb_alpha) **entering the race for the [three vacant Board Seats](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election#2018-2019_openSUSE_Board_Elections).

Marina is a very active Italian [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) Advocate, involved in the [Project](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Project) since 2009, deeply involved in LibreOffice.  She relocated to Munich last June, where she is working for CIB mainly on its LibreOffice team as Senior Migrations & Deployments Engineer.  You may read more about Marina on her [Wiki User page](https://en.opensuse.org/User:Deneb_alpha).

Marina joins an already impressive line-up of [Quality Candidates](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election#2018-2019_openSUSE_Board_Candidates) who announced they were stepping up during the past week, adding to what will be very tough decisions for the Voters in the upcoming Elections.  Official [openSUSE Members](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Members) in [Good Standing](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Guiding_principles) are qualified to vote in the Elections, and they will have to make difficult choices for who should take the three open Board Seats, choosing between Marina, incumbent [Christian Boltz aka cboltz](https://blog.cboltz.de/archives/78-board_candidates++-or-running-for-the-openSUSE-Board-again.html), [Dr. Axel Braun aka DocB](https://connect.opensuse.org/pg/profile/docb), incumbent [Sarah Julia Kriesch aka AdaLovelace](https://sarah-julia-kriesch.eu/2019/01/04/running-for-the-opensuse-board-again), [Sébastien Poher aka sogal](https://connect.opensuse.org/pg/profile/sogal), [Vinzenz Vietzke aka vinzv](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election_2019_platform_vinzv), and [Nathan Wolf aka futureboy and CubicleNate](https://en.opensuse.org/User:Futureboy) on IRC.

Sarah and Sébastien's run for the Board was announced in [last Wednesday's openSUSE News](https://news.opensuse.org/2019/01/09/first-two-candidates-for-the-2018-2019-opensuse-board-elections-announced/), while the Candidacies of Christian, Dr. Braun, Vinzenz, and  Nathan were announced in the [next day's news article](https://news.opensuse.org/2019/01/10/six-impressive-candidates-step-up-for-the-2018-2019-board-elections/).


## Drive Still Underway for New openSUSE Members


The [Elections Committee](mailto:election-officials@opensuse.org) would like to remind all [openSUSE Contributors](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:How_to_participate) that a healthy [Project](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Project) is only possible if it has a robust roster of [Members](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Members), and it is especially important for the Elections process.

Applications for openSUSE Membership are accepted and processed on an ongoing basis, but a Membership Drive has been declared by the Elections Officials in an effort to get as many qualified Project Contributors to take part in the voting process, which is scheduled to begin February 4, 2019, and run for 12 days with ballots closing February 15.


### Contributors Should Get Involved


**All openSUSE Contributors and Members** are requested to actively urge other Contributors who are not Members to get their Membership and get out and vote.  All Members who have been approved by the [Membership Committee](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Membership_officials) before the start of balloting February 4 will be eligible to vote in this election.

You can apply for openSUSE Membership by following the [instructions here](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Members).
