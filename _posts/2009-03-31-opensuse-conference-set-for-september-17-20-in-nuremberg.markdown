The openSUSE Project will be having its first full-on contributor's conference this September in beautiful Nuremberg, Germany.

There's still a lot of planning to be done, but we want to get the word out that the conference will take place from September 17 through September 20. Mark your calendars, buy your tickets, and start packing...

**The most important details: **



	
  * Date: September 17 - 20, 2009

	
  * Location: Nuremberg, Germany

	
  * Cost to attend: None - free to attend

	
  * Dress code: None - but you have to wear clothes


Additional details can be found (or are forthcoming) [on the openSUSE wiki](http://en.opensuse.org/OpenSUSE_Conf_2009).

If you're interested in being part of the conference team, speak up on the opensuse-marketing mailing list. We're looking for contributors to help with speaker selection, event staff, video recording talks and sessions, and much more. See the wiki for more help, and add your name if you're interested in being part of the conference team.

We'll be starting the call for presentations on April 14th.

The conference will not be all talks and no work: There will be plenty of time for breakout sessions, birds of a feather, and hacking sessions.
