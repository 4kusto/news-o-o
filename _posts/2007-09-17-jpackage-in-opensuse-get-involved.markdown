[The JPackage project](//jpackage.org/) aims to provide rpm packages with lots of Java programs and libraries. The main focus is on free and open source software. Currently there are about 450 packages maintained. Examples of packaged software are: ant, jakarta, jboss, jeronimo, excalibur and plexus.

Due to differences between Linux distributions most of the packages from JPackage do not build currently on openSUSE. We would like to change this state. We've already started with adjusting of packages to fit our distribution and moved now further packages into the Build Service. Please, visit the Java:jpackage-1.7 project in the [openSUSE Build Service](//build.opensuse.org/) to get the feel.

If you like Java and want to help us we would like to welcome you in our team. Please, get involved and help us to get JPackage fully into openSUSE. If you prefer other distributions like Fedora or Mandriva we would like to hear from you as well as BuildService is also perfectly suitable for you.
