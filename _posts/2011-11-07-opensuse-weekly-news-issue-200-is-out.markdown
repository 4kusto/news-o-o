### Congratulation Mails



Andreas Jaeger (Program Manager openSUSE)


        

200 issues of the openSUSE weekly news - that means nearly 4 years of 
monitoring what's happening around openSUSE, writing nicely about it on tight 
schedule, translating it so that people have access in their native tongue to 
some information,... I'm impressed and gratefull for your service to the 
openSUSE project.

Thanks,
Andreas


      





Jos Poortvliet (Community Manager openSUSE)

Congrats on the 200th release of OWN! Well before I joined openSUSE I 
already knew about OWN it is frequently posted or referenced around the 
web. And in the last year I often had OWN come to my rescue - if I'm too 
busy to keep up with what's going on, OWN helps to catch up quickly!

I know I am not alone in this, the tireless work of you, heliosred and 
everyone else who helps (especially the translators) is very valuable 
for openSUSE.

Thanks! 





Stefan Werden (open-slx)

Congratulations, the 200th weekly news is out!  
I can remember the first start of the weekly news and now we have  number 200! A lot of
users are reading weekly news to stay tuned with  Linux. Weeky news is a fantastic resource to
get a clear overview and  what is happening in open source space. The good presentation makes
things easy to read and easy to understand.  I like to thank everybody in this project, founding members as well as  contributors
spending every week there free time to provide this great  service.  Of cause open-slx will continue sponsoring weekly news and insure any  contributor has a
lot of fun in presenting weekly news.  
Stefan Werden

##### Top voted Features




            [decouple download and installation (Score: 375)](https://features.opensuse.org/120340)
          

Network installation could be improved by running package download and package
            installation in parallel.

            [Look at plymouth for splash during boot (Score: 203)](https://features.opensuse.org/305493)
          

I wanted to open a fate feature about this when I first heard of plymouth, but
            reading
            http://fedoramagazine.wordpress.com/2008/10/21/interview-fedora-10s-better-startup/
            really makes me think we should go this way.

Ray's comment starting with "Every flicker and mode change in the boot
            process takes away from the whole experience." is especially interesting. Is it
            okay to track the "don't show grub by default" here?






            [1-click uninstall (Score: 173)](https://features.opensuse.org/305305)
          

An easy way to remove Software! For example: you installed an application with "1-click install" (which will install all the packages that you need), there should be an easy way (also with 1 click) to remove what you have installed with that 1-click operation... in another words: an "1-click Uninstall" to remove installed software (dependencies and packages included).






            [Update to GRUB v2 (Score: 166)](https://features.opensuse.org/308497)
          

Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn't
            going to go away. The code itself isn't well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It's only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don't have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

            [Popularity contest (Score: 117)](https://features.opensuse.org/305877)
          

We need a feedback about packages that are preferred by users and actively used. Debian already has a tool named Popularity contest (popcon)
            
          

* reusing popcon will give us results that are directly comparable with Debian and Ubuntu
          

* packagers team can take care of the package
          

* we need a configuration dialog in YaST that is visible enough
          

* we need a server infrastructure on opensuse.org. (There are certain privacy issues, see Debian FAQ for details)

**Features newly requested last week. Please vote and/or comment if you get interested.**




            [Use AppArmor or SELinux for every (suse) package](https://features.opensuse.org/312927)
          

It would be nice to add apparmor or selinux profiles to every rpm package and , of course, use them! It would let suse become one of the most secure linux systems out there. And the best: the user just installs a package and hasen't to care about anything ;)

But it would also need a secure (GUI) "Permission Asker", like windows and of course an easy to use frontend for editing profiles (just easier than the current yast one)

        [Linux Journal/Bruce Byfield: Four Hidden Tools in Scribus](http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/four-hidden-tools-scribus)
      

Scribus is a powerful tool, but its menus are poorly laid-out. While you can usually
        find the features you most frequently use without any trouble, others may be hidden almost
        anywhere. From the Extras, Script, and Windows menus to the Document Setup dialog, useful
        features can be positioned almost anywhere, with only the most token regard for logic.

### For Commandline/Script Newbies




        [BashShell.net/Mike: Understanding the cat Command](http://bashshell.net/commands/understanding-the-cat-command/)
      

**cat**

Cat is  used to either view, create, or join multiple text files together.  (In fact, the term cat is short for catenate, which is a fancy way of saying to join two things together, end-to-end.)

By default, stdin for cat is the keyboard, and stdout is the computer screen.  If you just type cat at the command prompt, you™ll be able to type in text, and make it echo back to you as soon as you hit Enter.  It will keep doing this until you press Ctrl-d to end it. (...)

        [Wazi/W. Jason Gilmore: jQuery and Ajax Error Detection and Handling](http://olex.openlogic.com/wazi/2011/jquery-and-ajax-error-detection-and-handling/)
      

Website development duties were once assigned to different individuals with two distinct roles: A designer focused on the all matters related to the front-end HTML and CSS, and a developer was responsible for the server-side code. JavaScript™s meteoric rise to first-class citizen status has blurred these traditional lines, forcing developers into what was once considered taboo territory. The results have been spectacular, with frameworks such as [jQuery](http://olex.openlogic.com/packages/jquery) significantly streamlining JavaScript™s often unwieldy native syntax, and programming techniques such as [Ajax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29) bringing highly responsive user interfaces to the browser. The marrying of jQuery and Ajax has been particularly impactful, providing developers with a powerful solution to the problem of asynchronously interacting with and updating parts of a web page.

        [linuxcareer.com/Writing manual pages on Linux](http://how-to.linuxcareer.com/writing-manual-pages-on-linux)
      

**1. Introduction**

It's a very common fact that nobody likes to write documentation. Heck, nobody likes to read it either. But there are times when we have to read it in order to, say, finish the project on time, or, especially when working in software development, even write it. If you only have to read it, we always encouraged you to do so, but if you'll have to write the manual pages and need a kickstart, here's the article for you. If you worked previously with HTML your life will be easier, but if not it's alright. Writing manual pages for Linux is not that hard, despite the look of the pages when read in plain-text. So basically you'll need some Linux knowledge and the ability to use a text editor. You will learn (with examples, of course) the main concepts in text formatting as applied to man pages and how to write a simple manual page. Since we used yest as an example for our [C development tutorial](http://how-to.linuxcareer.com/c-development-on-linux-introduction), we will use snippets from its manual page to illustrate our point during this article.

Naming is unusual in SMB/CIFS networks. Although modern clients can use Internet domain names to refer to each other, older clients relied on a Microsoft-specific system known as the Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) server, or the NetBIOS Name Server (NBNS); the two terms are synonymous. Configuring Samba properly for name resolution is therefore important. So is configuring browsing, which is the mechanism by which servers learn what shares are available on specific servers. (...)

        11.10](http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/linux/Pages/radeon_linux.aspx) driver for Linux! For quite some time that a large group of users from the
      community follow Catalyst releases hopping that some [problematic issues are fixed](http://ati.cchtml.com/show_bug.cgi?id=99),
      unfortunatly [GNOME3](http://www.gnome3.org), the latest Desktop experience
      from the [GNOME Project](http://www.gnome.org), continues to display serious
      glitches when using this proprietary driver blob.

For GNOME3 users, this driver isn™t recommended at all, and people should stick with the
      default radeon open source driver provided by the community which has awesome support for r300
      and r600 chipsets (and improving every day).

The previous release, 11.9 has fixed one of the issues with GNOME3 (the rainbow activity
      bar), but showed regressions in many other fields, including on [KDE](http://www.kde.org) (including also on Windows). All ATI/AMD users live to
      see better days in the future!

Microsoft™s proposed use of [Unfied Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)](http://www.uefi.org/home/) in Windows 8 could be used to [block all other operating systems from Windows 8 systems](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/microsoft-to-stop-linux-older-windows-from-running-on-windows-8-pcs/9589). [The Linux Foundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/) and partners have a better idea: Secure computers with UEFI and give users freedom of operating system choice.

In the Linux Foundation document, [Making UEFI Secure Boot Work With Open Platforms](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/publications/making-uefi-secure-boot-work-with-open-platforms) (PDF Link), James Bottomley, CTO of Server Virtualization at [Parallels](http://www.parallels.com/) and Linux Foundation Technical Advisory Board Chair Jonathan Corbet, Editor at [LWN.net](http://lwn.net/) and fellow Linux Foundation Technical Advisory Board Member, after consulting with other Linux leaders, explain how Linux and other open operating systems will be able to take advantage of secure boot if it is implemented properly in the hardware. (...)

The [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) development team [announced](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2011/10/31/ruby-1-9-3-p0-is-released/) the release of version 1.9.3 of its open source programming language. [Described as](http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/40527) basically being "an implementation-improved version of Ruby 1.9.2", the first release of the new stable series of Ruby improves library loading performance and brings changes to the Ruby licence.

Ruby 1.9.3 p0 source code is made available under a 2-clause BSD Licence and the[ Ruby Licence](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/LICENSE.txt); previous versions of Ruby were released under the GPLv2 and Ruby Licence. Other changes include improved locking in multi-threaded programs, regular expression support for Unicode 6.0 and a new library io/console for simple portable access to the console. Also among the modifications are changes to Random.rand and extra String methods such as prepend and byteslice, though generally, the developers say you should be able to safely switch to Ruby 1.93 from 1.9.2.
