![](https://events.opensuse.org/system/conferences/logos/000/000/040/original/osc17final.png)The [openSUSE Conference](https://events.opensuse.org/) is about seven weeks away and this year will again have high-quality keynote speakers.

Keynote speakers for this year’s conference at the [Z-Bau](//z-bau.com/) in Nuremberg, Germany, from May 26 - 28 will be from [SaltStack](https://saltstack.com/), [KDE](https://www.kde.org/) and [Free Software Foundation Europe](https://fsfe.org/index.en.html). 

[Matthias Kirschner](https://fsfe.org/about/kirschner/kirschner.en.html), President of FSFE, will take the stage on May 26 at 10 a.m. and provide attendees an exorbitant amount of information about governance and open source.

Later that evening, there will be entertainment and a Brazilian style barbecue, so stick around for the Friday night fun.

The following day (May 27) at 10 a.m., we welcome back the Chief Technology Officer and co-founder of [SaltStack](https://saltstack.com/), [Thomas Hatch](https://saltstack.com/leadership/). Hatch will be discussing how to control modern data center complexity, and turn it to a competitive advantage, using SaltStack and SUSE technologies.

This year vice-president of the KDE e.V., [Aleix Pol](https://ev.kde.org/corporate/board.php), will discuss the development process, and then will go over what the [KDE community](https://www.kde.org/community/) has been up to in terms of Quality Assurance. Pol’s keynote, which is at 10 a.m. on May 28, will present ideas to collaborate and create better solutions together across the open-source ecosystem.

If you have not registered for the [openSUSE Conference](https://events.opensuse.org/), now would be a good time. Look for the schedule to be released in the coming weeks.
