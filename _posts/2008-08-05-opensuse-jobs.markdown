## Student, Practical - users.opensuse.org Enhancements


The users.opensuse.org website has been started as central place of the openSUSE project for user provided information.Â  We'd like to enhance it in several ways:

users.opensuse.org has some initial support for membership management and we'd like to enlarge this:



	
  * coupling with hermes for notifications

	
  * adding comment fields for members (for voting purpose and for reject message)

	
  * for each board member a separate voting queue


Further enhancements include:

	
  * openID integration

	
  * upload of gpg keys


users.opensuse.org is implemented in Ruby on Rails.


## Student, Practical - lists.opensuse.org Enhancements


lists.opensuse.org is the mailserver of the openSUSE project and we need some overhaul in various areas:



	
  * Port lists.opensuse.org layout to new openSUSE theme (simple HTML/CSS work)

	
  * Support UTF in search engine (Mostly perl, some C and packaging)

	
  * Various smaller tasks including:

	
    * simplify and fix up various bash scripts

	
    * documentation of the setup

	
    * porting the whole system to new hardware







## General information for the above two positions


The openSUSE team is looking for students to implement these enhancements.Â  We'd like to offer a job for up to two months.Â  Most of the team you'll be working with is located in Nuernberg, Germany.Â  We would like to have candidates working from Nuernberg but are open to other setups as well.
