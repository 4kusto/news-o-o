####  [**openSUSE News: openSUSE Strategy Meeting**](https://news.opensuse.org/2010/05/20/opensuse-strategy-meeting/)


"For the past few months we, the openSUSE Board, together with the great help from Kurt Garloff, Jan Weber and Andreas Jaeger, held a series of strategy sessions to address the future of openSUSE. We discussed the role of openSUSE as a community and project and looked at data from a variety of sources, including the recent openSUSE 2010 Survey to identify and build a strategy of strength and empowerment within our community, with a goal of establishing a common unified ground for answering the question to ourselves and to the world¦ Why openSUSE? and openSUSE™s role in the operating system market, both today and in the future.  After much discussion, we™re finally ready to bring together these important bits of information into a cohesive statement that everyone can unify around. As such, we, the members of the Strategy Team, will be meeting in Nuremberg the weekend of May 28th to formalize a draft of our strategy that will be available publicly for open discussion and comment."

####  Larry Finger: openSUSE-Testing Report for the Weekly News - May 22


"The Testing Core Team meeting that was planned for May 24 has been postponed until May 31 due to a late bug that prevents systems installed from DVD or Live CD from booting. See [https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=607480](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=607480) for details.  As the NET install is not affected, I have used this method to perform both full installs and updates to a production machine and some sandboxes.  My kudos to Team member Bernhard M. Wiedemann for his testing of installation and the detection of problems. His efforts should improve the details of a user's first look at a release.  As the full release of 11.3 M7 will be available next week, I should have more information regarding bugs and stability in the May 30 newsletter."

"or basic inventory of what we have.  Temporary openSUSE Wiki is created few moths ago to allow test of new tools and content reorganization without disrupting daily operation of openSUSE Wiki. It is running on MediaWiki version 1.15.1. The basic software is already much better then the old version 1.5, but the goal is not only to have one time cleanup, but also to organize wiki that will provide benefits for all involved parties: visitors, writers and maintainers. To achieve this we added few extensions to the basic MediaWiki listed here.  Semantic MediaWiki is complex extension that has its own extensions.It can become one of our flagships, but at the time of this post I don't know much about it."

"It has been mentioned that the Geeko is somewhat of a schizophrenic at times, and do you know what I kind of have to agree. The difference is I disagree on how the schizophrenia affects our dear friend. Most people think that the multiple personalities are desktop related - you know, KDE vs GNOME vs XFCE vs $DE. I on the other hand feel it is to with audience - Enterprise vs Consumer. Now don't get me wrong, the Geeko does a great job at both. The problem is there doesn't seem to be a great deal of interaction between the two personalities."

screen bash -c "cd \"$PWD\" && exec $SHELL --login"

}

When I'm in screen and I need another shell in the same directory (e.g. because I'm opening a spec file in vim and need another shell to test the build of the RPM package with osc), I then just type ,d !"

For starters, this nifty tool lets you set up multiple monitoring profiles, which can come in handy when you want to keep an eye on several servers. Besides ping, httpmon supports other monitoring options, such as response time, response code, and specific header and content strings. Better yet, you can specify multiple criteria; for example, you can configure httpmon to ping a specific server and check its response time in one go."
