![](http://i.imgur.com/POgU9ks.png)News of Linux releases are getting most of the headlines during November while snapshots of openSUSE Tumbleweed have subtly been flying under the radar.

Other than Nov. 3 and Nov. 6, openSUSE Tumbleweed had updated software snapshots released every day this month.

The last update on news.opensuse.org included snapshot [20161108](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-11/msg00161.html) and the 13 snapshots that have followed that have included hundreds of new packages.

The streak will continue past the most recent snapshot that is list [20161121](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-11/msg00460.html). Snapshot  [20161121](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-11/msg00460.html) updated the [Linux kernel to version 4.8.9](https://www.kernel.org/). The snapshot also includes an update in the repositories for [CMake 3.7.0](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.7/release/3.7.html), which adds several new modules and commands.

<!-- more -->The snapshot the day before, [20161120](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-11/msg00450.html), updated perl-DBD-SQLite, perl-XML-XPath and perl-Log-Log4perl. Internet Relay Client [Polari ](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Polari)was updated to version 3.22.2 and fixed a glitch when opening a user list. Snapshot [20161119](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-11/msg00419.html) updated autoyast2 to version 3.2.3 and yast2 to version 3.2.4.

WireShark was updated to version 2.2.2 in the [20161118](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-11/msg00413.html) snapshot and provides updated protocol support for networks including [OpenFlow](https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-resources/openflow) and [ZigBee](http://www.zigbee.org/). Libvirt also received several new subpackages in the snapshot.

The largest snapshot in the Tumbleweed streak was [20161117](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-11/msg00410.html). Snapshot [20161117](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-11/msg00410.html) provided a major update to Mozilla Firefox 50.0, a minor update to Mesa with 13.0.1, and KDE [Frameworks  5.28.0](https://www.kde.org/announcements/kde-frameworks-5.28.0.php) brought numerous KWayland improvements.

KDE Applications was updated to [16.08.3](https://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-applications-16.08.3.php), which only contained bugfixes and translation updates, in the [20161113](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-11/msg00315.html) and [20161112](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-11/msg00272.html) snapshots. Snapshot [20161112](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-11/msg00272.html) provided an update to [VirtualBox 5.1.8_k4.8.6_2](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Changelog) and both [20161112](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-11/msg00272.html) and [20161110](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-11/msg00233.html) delivered updates to [GNOME 3.22.2](https://wiki.gnome.org/ThreePointTwentythree).
