## About the conference


Over 2500 years ago, the ancient Greek civilization ushered in a new era in human thinking with the development of [Philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy). Philosophy represented humanities first systematic approach at employing critical, rational thinking to solve the mysteries of reality, existence, values and language. After tens of thousands of years of [magical thinking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking), they started the age of reason, which, through Greek and Hellenistic philosophers and medieval Islamic thinkers, led to the European Renaissance and Enlightenment. Thanks to their thinking, we now build airplanes, went to the moon and have comfy showers.

From July 19 until July 22 2013, Thessaloniki, the second largest city in Greece, will be host to the fifth openSUSE Conference. Hundreds of developers from around the globe will come to the country where the modern Age of Reason started. In the place where once great thinkers like Parmenides, Hippocrates and Socrates sat down and taught the art of logical and critical thinking, we'll now sit down and talk critically about logic and code. If you want to join us, discuss the mysteries of reality, existence, freedom and computer languages, work on the future of Free and Open Source Software!

## We'll have fun!


The Greek Philosophers were part of a revolution which changed the world. So are we, and thus, under the motto of **"Power to the Geeko"**, we will gather and work on our revolution! See you in Thessaloniki!
