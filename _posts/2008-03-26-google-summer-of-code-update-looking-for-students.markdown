The openSUSE Project is looking for students who are interested in contributing to the project via the Google Summer of Code. The application deadline for students is Monday, March 31st at 5 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time. (00:00 UTC, April 1, 2008)





If you're not sure whether you're qualified to join as a student, check the SoC [FAQ](http://code.google.com/opensource/gsoc/2008/faqs.html#0.1_eligibility) -- it spells out the eligibility very well. 



After all students have submitted applications, the mentoring organization (in this case, the openSUSE project) will review and rank the proposals.





Mentors must be signed up by April 11, and students must be matched with mentors.





The entire timeline is available on the [Google Summer of Code site](http://code.google.com/opensource/gsoc/2008/faqs.html#0.1_timeline).





The openSUSE Project's ideas page is available [on the openSUSE wiki](http://en.opensuse.org/Summer_of_Code_2008). As you can see, we have a ton of good ideas. We're open to more, though, so feel free to add one if it's something you're particularly interested in working on.





If you have any questions about the Summer of Code program, please contact [Joe 'Zonker' Brockmeier](mailto:zonker@opensuse.org) or [Christoph Thiel](mailto:cthiel@suse.de).
