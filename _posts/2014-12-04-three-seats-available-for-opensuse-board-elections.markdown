[![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/drawing1-212x300.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/drawing1.png)[Elections](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election) to fill three seats on the [openSUSE Board](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board) are set to begin in the coming weeks and candidates are needed to fill these three positions.

Individuals who apply for an [openSUSE Membership](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Members) will be able to vote during elections and run for candidacy

Candidates elected to the position will serve a 24-month term. The terms of Robert Schweikert and Kosta Koudaras' will expire and the seat of Peter Linnell, who was appointed as a replacement for chairman Richard Brown, will need to be filled.

Members of the openSUSE board help to influence the future direction of the project. Members are encouraged to learn the [election process](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Membership_officials#Process), run for the board or propose a candidate.
