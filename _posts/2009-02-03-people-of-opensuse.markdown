Who is this guy named notlocalhorst, FunkyPenguin or cb400f? Well, without [people of openSUSE]( //news.opensuse.org/category/people-of-opensuse/) it's quite hard to tell if you didn't met them in person. So it's a great overview to see what the people are doing, how the look and how the tick. Of course this will not replace the joy of meeting some of them in person, like on [FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org) :-)

Anyway, Carlos the previous maintainer of the series can't do it anymore because of time reasons. It would be a shame if we let it die ... If someone from the community is willing to do that job? It could be even a small team, there is no strict schedule when to release an interview, and everybody will love you :-)

If you want to do it, just head over to the openSUSE-marketing list, there will be a tread called "people of opensuse soon" ...

Carlos: thank you for doing it for quite a long time! In fact, several manga-inspired collect them all type games have been hugely successful in the united states consider  phone tracker the likes of pokemon, digimon and the tamagatchi
