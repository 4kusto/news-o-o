[**COSCUP**](//coscup.org/) is the largest FLOSS conference organized by local communities in Taiwan. The conference has sessions for new users, enthusiastic promoters, coders or anyone who is interested in cutting-edge FLOSS technologies. The goal is to create a friendly and informative environment for people from different communities to make friends, learn new technologies and inspire each other.

At COSCUP 2011, several KDE and openSUSE contributors gave talks and presented "cool stuff" at their booths. This year, we will have a fully dedicated track for KDE and openSUSE and starting today, you can send in session proposals.

## Two day track dedicated to KDE and openSUSE


We are glad to announce that in 2012 the COSCUP conference will feature a full two-day track dedicated entirely to KDE and openSUSE. People from both organisations have teamed up to bring you the best talks possible.

But for that, we need your help!



## Call for Paper


The program committee is looking for talks about KDE and openSUSE. Possible topics are (but not limited to):


  * desktop technologies (d-bus, gstreamer, etcetera)
embedded and mobile


  * distribution technologies (packaging tools, build systems, etcetera)


  * challenges in adapting software to local needs (L10N, I18N)


  * cross-desktop and cross-distribution collaboration


  * cloud computing and integration into the desktop


  * or anything else you think the world should hear about!

KDE BOF at COSCUP 2011

Although KDE and openSUSE have always been close the talks do not necessarily have to be related to both KDE and openSUSE (like ownCloud or Apper). In the spirit of our openness and collaboration we welcome talk proposals about KDE on other distributions (Fedora, Ubuntu, etcetera), or other desktops and non-desktop technologies on openSUSE (GNOME, OpenStack, etcetera).

The call for papers ends on June 15. Please send in a proposal of about 200 words, accompanied by a ~50 words biography, in either English or Chinese, to [this address](mailto:cfp@opensuse.org ) before that date.



## Program committee


The Program Committee for the KDE/openSUSE track at COSCUP consists of the following people:


  * Franklin Weng (KDE)


  * Aaron J. Seigo (KDE)


  * Sakana (openSUSE)


  * Al Cho (openSUSE)


  * Bryen Yunashko (openSUSE)


  * Greg Kroah-Hartman (the Linux Foundation)
