* A clear and complete application is faster and easier to process.

* The Travel Team won't be able to book or pay in advance for any requester.

* We cannot fulfill all requests, keep in mind that there is no guarantee you will get sponsored.

* Sponsorship decisions are influenced by the history of the requester, like having followed the requirement of writing a report about a conference you attended with sponsorship or having send in the required paperwork in time.

* Your involvement with openSUSE is pretty relevant.

* If you were part of Google Summer of Code as openSUSE student or mentor you should mention it in your application.

* If you submitted an abstract to be presented at openSUSE Conference you should  mention it in your application.

* It's important you tell us which airport you will be departing from.

*  Try to get the best fares for tickets and lodging. Remember you still have to pay at least 20% yourself and the committee will verify the amount requested looking for the best offers on public website (E.g. KAYAK, Expedia, e-Dreams,...).

The Travel Team sends a reply upon receiving your application. We will then wait for all applicants to send in their requests for the event and only once we have a full overview, responses will be given. Please do not send personal emails, always CC the travel-support team in your replies.

_Hope to see you in Prague!_
