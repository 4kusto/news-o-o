What an exciting list of candidates, all extremely qualified to represent our community in the upcoming board.  With just two open seats to be filled to begin a two-year term,  Agustin Bethencourt, openSUSE Team Lead at SUSE,  recently noted: "Interesting times are ahead and, In any possible scenario we are thinking of, the Board will play a key role."


## So What's Next?


As defined in the previous announcement by the Election Officials, the remaining steps in this year's election timeline are that the candidates shall begin officially campaigning henceforth.  Balloting will begin on 5 December, 2012.

All eligible members of the openSUSE Project will be notified with the process for submitting their ballot to choose their two favorite candidates for the Board.  Members will have up to 16 December, 2012 to vote.

Then, if all goes well, and we don't see any reason why it shouldn't, we'll be announcing the winners of this year's election on 17 December, 2012.

You can read the full set of timeline and [procedures here](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election).

The Election Officials committee would like to extend good luck wishes to each and every candidate and look forward to the conclusion of this exciting campaign.
