Google published the list of [12 students proposals that have been accepted](//www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2012/opensuse) for Google Summer of Code 2012 for openSUSE. It means that 12 students will be able to work full-time on changing the world this summer!<!-- more -->





## 51 proposals, 12 students accepted




Big thanks to every student who dedicated their time thinking up and writing awesome proposals: we received a total of 51 proposals! This year Google allocated 12 students slots to openSUSE. This means we had a very hard time deciding! What projects will benefit openSUSE most, what will teach the student most? Do we mentor new students or give people already familiar with openSUSE a chance to dedicate some real time? There are practical considerations too. We don't have mentors for all projects, or multiple students per mentor. Some mentors can only mentor in the evening, others only during the day - we have to watch time zones too.




But we've managed to extract 12 proposals out of the brilliance thrown at us and these students now will have to _geeko_ up for their awesome summer job!
