Let the fun begin! This week it was announced that the [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) Project is one of the 212 mentoring organization for this yearâ€™s [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), which is an annual international program that awards [stipends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipend) to university students to write code and learn about open source development during their summer break.

The openSUSE Project has participated in GSoC since 2006 and has helped more than 50 students get started with free software development.

As a mentoring organization, eligible students will have an opportunity between March 12 - 27 to submit a project proposal to the [GSoC program site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). The program is open to university students aged 18 or over.

The [openSUSE website dedicated to GSoC](http://101.opensuse.org/gsoc/) offers nine projects that GSoC students can select from to use for their proposals. The topics focus on [web development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development), [quality assurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_quality_assurance), [packaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager) and [user experience design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design). The technologies used in the project are [Ruby on Rail](http://rubyonrails.org/)s, [Perl](https://www.perl.org/), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Html/JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_scripts.asp) and [C/C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B).<!-- more -->

The list of those projects are:



 	
  * [Integrate cloud pinyin in ibus-pinyin or ibus-libpinyin](http://101.opensuse.org/gsoc/#eventModal0)

 	
  * [Schedule manual test case execution in openQA](http://101.opensuse.org/gsoc/#eventModal1)
