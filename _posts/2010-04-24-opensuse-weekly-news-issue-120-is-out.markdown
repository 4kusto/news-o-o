Base distribution upgrade  If you have been using SUSE Studio for a while, you most likely have older appliances built on openSUSE 11.1. Before today, you had the choice of sticking with openSUSE 11.1 or redo all of the software selection and configuration on top of a new openSUSE 11.2 appliance."

####  [OBS MeeGo Developer Meeting](http://news.opensuse.org/2010/04/19/obs-meego-developer-meeting/)


"OBS Developers from MeeGo project visited the SUSE OBS Developers in Nürnberg on friday and saturday. Not everybody managed to come due to the ash over europe, but at least  -Anas Nashif from Intel

-Alexander(Sasha) Kanevskiy from Nokia

-Martin Mohring from Linux Foundation

-Jan-Simon Möller from Linux Foundation

-Andreas Jaeger from Novell/SUSE

-Michael Schröder from Novell/SUSE

-Adrian Schröter from Novell/SUSE

spoke about a lot of features and wanted design changes in OBS. The MeeGo project uses OBS to create their packages and products in similar setup and with needs as openSUSE. In short this is having multiple code streams, which are used to create multiple products, which require maintenance updates and QA validations. This give us plenty areas of collaboration and makes us hoping to drive OBS in a good direction for all of us."  


####  [Jan Kupec: zypper-1.4.2: rewritten package selection code](http://jniq.blogspot.com/2010/04/zypper-142-rewritten-package-selection.html)


"Zypper has undergone a major refactoring of its package selection code recently. This was mainly to enable automatic testing and to make it easier and safer to add new features.  I'll submit zypper 1.4.2 including this change to Factory soon. It seems to work fine for the most part, but if you spot something that used to work for you in 1.4.1, please let us know via bugzilla. Don't forget to attach both zypper.log and solver test case."

"The Build Service Team is proud to release the version 1.7.3 of OBS. It is recommended to update to this version for everybody who is running an own OBS instance. Instances which re-use resources from build.opensuse.org instance are required to update to support the new required "rpm-md-legacy" repository mode. Publishing repositories for older distributions will fail otherwise."

####  [Klaas Freitag (dragotin): Kraft 0.40 for KDE 4 Released](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/04/18/kraft-0-40-for-kde-4-released/)


"I am very happy to announce the new stable version 0.40 of the KDE office software Kraft. After eleven month of porting work, Kraft 0.40 is the first version which is based on the KDE 4 software platform. Huge changes on the codebase of Kraft happened to benefit from the new technology of KDE 4 and after long long hours of work, we’re there :-)  Basically the new version equals the last KDE 3 version feature wise beside some changes which aim to make Kraft even more convenient to explore for unexperienced users. We got much feedback that the setup with MySQL was to complicated for people who just want to do a quick test. So we had to do something about that. The alternative was the clever run-mysql-as-the-user method just like Akonadi does it, but still the dependency on MySQL remains with that solution. So I went for SQLite, because its seemed so easy. Well, SQLite did not convince me completely yet, but it is working for Kraft."  


####  [Mehrdad Momeny (mtux): A new plugin system for Choqok](http://momeny.wordpress.com/2010/04/18/a-new-plugin-system-for-choqok/)


"During last week I was working on a new plugin system for Choqok, It’s idea was in my mind for about 2 months, But now, It’s ready to use, and develop plugins for it. Choqok supports image uploading to Twitpic since early versions, and supports Media attachment in Identica/Statusnet service since latest Beta release. But, There are so many image/video uploading services out there! what if we want to support them too!?"

MonoMac is the result of years of experimentation in blending .NET with Objective-C and is inspired by the same design principles that we used for MonoTouch.  It is also the result of weekend hacking as our day to day work revolves around Mono's efforts on Linux servers, Linux desktops, Visual Studio integration and our mobile efforts. Luckily, it shares some components with MonoTouch."

Since the initial announcement the guide has had a few improvements including short, embedded screencasts using html5+Ogg Theora, demonstrating how to install packages, adding repositories and basic terminal usage.  The guide has been averaging steadily at about 230 unique visitors per day in the entire 5 month period. By far the most of the visitors are American, Germans are second, while the Danes, the British and the Russians are nearly tied for third place. Around 70% of the visitors are using a GNU/Linux operating system."

"Aloha, I’m Andrew Wafaa. Most people call me Andy or Wafaa. I’m a married, father of three living in the UK. I’m a Scotsman born and bred in Aberdeen (The Granite City), but have some Egyptian blood in me, this led to my old General Manager calling me a “Camel Herder With A Skirt”, which stuck with me ever since.  Professionally I’m a Solutions Architect mainly dealing with SLES for one of the big service providers. The title is all grand but I basically pen push now and do a load of documentation which is really boring. Thankfully openSUSE is there to keep me alive and interested in life ;-) "

"Expected for release in May, Linux kernel version 2.6.34 contains several new network drivers and various advancements designed to improve network performance or increase network configuration flexibility, which will particularly impact virtualisation.  "The development of 2.6.34 has been slightly less smooth than usual: First, Torvalds baffled many developers with a shorter merge window, then RC2 was released comparatively late and included more changes than usual; furthermore, both versions contained significant problems, as Torvalds had to admit when releasing RC3. RC4 has now been released after two weeks, longer than the normal weekly release cycle. Torvalds explained that this was due to "hunting a really annoying VM regression"."  


####  [Linux Weekly News: Kernel prepatch 2.6.34-rc5](http://lwn.net/Articles/384026/rss)


"The 2.6.34-rc5 prepatch is out. "Random fixes all around. The most noticeable (for people who got hit by it) may be the fix for bootup problems that some people had (ACPI dividing by zero: kernel bugzilla 15749), but there's stuff all over. The shortlog gives some idea." Said shortlog is in the announcement, or see the full changelog for all the details. For added fun, this release has a new code name: "Sheep on meth.""

####  [nixCraft/Vivek Gite: 10 Tools To Add Some Spice To Your UNIX Shell Scripts](http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/spice-up-your-unix-linux-shell-scripts.html)


"There are some misconceptions that shell scripts are only for a CLI environment. You can easily use various tools to write GUI and/or network (socket) scripts under KDE or Gnome desktops. Shell scripts can make use of some of the GUI widget (menus, warning boxs, progress bars etc). You can always control the final output, cursor position on screen, various output effects, and so on. With the following tools you can build powerful, interactive, user friendly UNIX / Linux bash shell scripts."

"If you ask what's missing from open source software, one of the top responses is often "documentation." While there's piles and piles of great code stuffed up on Google Code, SourceForge.net, and others, the actual documentation to accompany it is often lacking. This is why it's doubly sad to keep seeing bounty programs aimed at generating more and more code, and more and more coders, but very little being done to address documentation."

####  [ConsortiumInfo.org/Andy Updegrove: Oracle's ODF Plug-in Pricing: What's up with That?](http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=20100421065030157)


"When news of Oracle's intended acquisition of Sun Microsystems broke long ago, many people wondered what that would mean for OpenOffice, the most widely adopted full desktop implementation of ODF. But Oracle immediately imposed a company-wide "no comment" policy on that topic, so everyone has been wondering what the answer might be ever since.  So like many others, I expect, I’m trying to get my brain around Oracle’s reasoning in deciding to charge $90 for a formerly free ODF conversion plug-in developed by Sun Microsystems. That downloadable plug-in was intended for Microsoft Office users who wanted to import ODF-compliant documents created, most obviously, by users of the free, open source OpenOffice.org (OOo) version, or of Sun’s StarOffice, the for-sale, supported productivity suite based on the free OOo code.  Moreover, it’s not just $90 you’ll need to fork over – the plug-in is only available in packages of 100."
