Peter was widely known as founder of [Scribus, ](http://www.scribus.net)the [Libre Graphics Meeting](https://libregraphicsmeeting.org/) and enthusiastic contributor to countless other Free Software projects. For openSUSE he took over responsibility as an active member of our [package review team](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:OpenSUSE_review_team) and has served as openSUSE Board member twice, [from 2011-2012 and 2014-2016](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_history). Peter passed away a week ago after lengthy battle with cancer, he is survived by his wife Pauline and his daughter Stella. His [obituary](https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/peter-linnell-obituary?pid=191880041&affiliateid=2710) mentions ways to honor his life.

We will always remember Peter as fellow tinkerer, with an boundless passion to understand the inner workings and meanings of software **and** people. Farewell Peter, you'll be missed by the openSUSE Community.
