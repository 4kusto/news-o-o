Hello Mates! openSUSE Medical here!

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Opensuse_medical_logo11.png)](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/06/09/new-leadership-inside-the-medical-project/opensuse_medical_logo11/)

Well i would to announce that â€œopenSUSE Medical Calling and also needs youâ€

a) Due to lack of time (iâ€™ve began my Master Studies abroad) iâ€™ve to give up from the project. I think that there are people who are able to lead the project and have more time available.

So â€œLooking for openSUSE Medical Next Leaderâ€

b) I have created two pages (according to the last meetingâ€™s goals) :

i) â€œSection Pageâ€ : [http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Medical/section.html](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Medical/section.html)
ii) â€œParticipate Pageâ€ : [http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Medical/participate.html](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Medical/participate.html)

The process is you have a look at the Sections and then you declare your participation in the â€œParticipate Pageâ€ (according to the instructions given in the pages).

So the project needs you for:

a) â€œThe Next Project Leaderâ€

b) â€œParticipants for the Sectionsâ€

Anyone interested in (a) or (b) can reply to this e-mail or can post an e- mail to the [opensuse-medical@opensuse.org](mailto:opensuse-medical@opensuse.org)
