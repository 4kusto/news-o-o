[![Tumbleweed-black-green](/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Tumbleweed-black-green.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Tumbleweed-black-green.png)Tumbleweed had two snapshot this week and [Mesa](http://www.mesa3d.org/) updated two new minor versions since Saturday’s [20151209 snapshot](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2015-12/msg00228.html).

The biggest package update for the week was to autofs in the [20151214 snapshot](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2015-12/msg00239.html). Autofs, which is a program for automatically mounting directories, had several fixes and upstream patches.

Libraries for the Qt Cryptographic Architecture, libqca2, updated from version 2.0.3 to 2.1.1. There were several Perl updates, and Python-Cryptography updated to 1.1 and fixed an [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) security issue reported by Emilia Käsper from the Google Security Team.

Other packages updated in the Tumbleweed snapshots were [Mozilla Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/) updated to 38.4, [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) updated to version 2.8.16 and [Squid](http://www.squid-cache.org/) had a major version update to 4.0.3.

[Plasma 5.5](https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.4.95.php) is going through staging and users of Tumbleweed might see the update in an upcoming snapshot. However, [systemd](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) and the [Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/) are blocked due to some issues that need to be resolved, so users should not expect these two in a snapshots until the issues are resolved.
