If you are really in a timezone where it's still before March 31st 23:59 then...

<!-- more -->

We are pleased to announce the birth of the [Canterbury distribution](http://www.opensuse.org). Canterbury is a merge of the efforts of the community distributions formerly known as **Debian**,** Gentoo**, **Grml**,  **openSUSE** and **Arch** Linux to produce a really unified effort and be able to stand up in a combined effort against proprietary operating systems. To show off that the [Free Software community](http://www.fsf.org/) is actually able to work together for a common goal instead of creating more diversity!

Canterbury will be as technologically simple as Arch, as stable as Debian, malleable as Gentoo, have a solid Live framework as Grml, and be as open minded as openSUSE.

<blockquote>Arch Linux has always been about keeping its technology as simple as possible. Combining efforts into one single distribution will dramatically reduce complexity for developers, users and of course upstream projects. Canterbury will be the next evolutionary step of Linux distributions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>While DEX (Debian Derivatives Exchange) might have been a good idea in principle, its point of view is too limited. We need to reach out further for true success.</blockquote>

Robin H. Johnson, lead of the [Gentoo](http://gentoo.org) Infrastructure team, in a panel of core Gentoo developers at SCALE9x:


<blockquote>I really hate compiling-induced downtime. I've been looking forward to installing packages with just a couple of keystrokes. By building on the efforts of other successful distributions, we can take the drudgery out of system
maintenance.</blockquote>

Michael Prokop, founder of the [Grml](http://grml.org/) live CD, can be quoted on the effort:


<blockquote>We managed to create a universal live build framework with grml-live. Our vision was always that it will be universally usable to further the spreading of Free Software.</blockquote>

[![It's that dude from emergency room. I swear!](/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/klaas.png)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney)Last year's [openSUSE](http://opensuse.org) conference had the topic of "Collaboration Across Borders". Klaas Freitag, respected member of the community, mentioned


<blockquote>The conference motto was set intentional and actually this is what I had in mind as a positive outcome for the conference!</blockquote>
