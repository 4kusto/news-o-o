The openSUSE Project is proud to announce the openSUSE 11.0 Release Candidate 1 (RC1). The good news is that we're closing in on the final release of 11.0, but it's not time to relax just yet. We're getting really close, so we need all hands on deck to help test this release candidate. Since beta 3 we've fixed 578 bugs and resolved 1,118 bugs! Read on to see how you can help get 11.0 into top shape.

## Information and Download


The first step is to download the release candidate. Please remember that RC1 is not a stable release. As a release candidate, openSUSE 11.0 RC 1 is almost ready for day to day use, but may still have some interesting bugs that make it unsuitable for running a production system. Be sure to have backups of any important data before using openSUSE 11.0 RC 1 on a system.


### Media and Download


You can download openSUSE 11.0 RC 1 for x86, x86_64, and PPC at **[http://software.opensuse.org/developer](http://software.opensuse.org/developer)[](http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/11.0-RC1/iso/)**. Deltas from Beta 3 are [also provided](http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/11.0-RC1/iso/delta/). Note that you will need the latest deltarpm from Factory, or for openSUSE 10.3 you can use the [home:coolo](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/coolo/openSUSE_10.3/) repository to grab it.

### Call for Testing


To help testing, take a look at [opensuse.org/Testing](http://opensuse.org/Testing), and the [Feature Test List](http://en.opensuse.org/Testing:Features_11.0) page. The Feature Test List page includes a definitive list of new features included in openSUSE 11.0.

We need to test these features in particular, so please look through the features on the page, pick one that has not yet had its test completed, and make sure it passes. If not, be sure to file a bug in Bugzilla and mark the test "failed." See the full instructions on the Feature Test List page.


## Comments, Feedback, and Helping


With RC1, openSUSE 11.0 is almost ready for release, but we can still use help with testing before the official release. This is a great chance to contribute to openSUSE, by filing bug reports, testing features, and giving feedback to the openSUSE developers.

Here's a few ways to help:



	
  * **Report bugs**: If you do find a bug, be sure to report it in Bugzilla using the procedure given on [bugs.openSUSE.org](http://bugs.opensuse.org/).

	
  * **Provide feedback**: We welcome feedback! Please join us on the [opensuse-factory@opensuse.org](mailto:opensuse-factory@opensuse.org) ([subscribe](mailto:opensuse-factory+subscribe@opensuse.org)) mailing list. Or in the [#opensuse-factory](irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-factory) IRC channel.

	
  * **Let the world know!** Be sure to spread the word about openSUSE 11.0! Blog about it, tell your Linux User Group, start planning a [Launch Party](http://en.opensuse.org/OpenSUSE_11.0_Launch_Party_Locations) -- whatever you can do to let the world know about openSUSE 11.0!


Thanks to all the developers and contributors for all the hard work that's gone into openSUSE 11.0 so far, we've come a long way and only have a little more work to do before we have a final release. Fire up openSUSE 11.0 RC 1 and have a lot of fun!
