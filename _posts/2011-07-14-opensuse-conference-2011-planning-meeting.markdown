Let's discuss together what the current status of each area is, who's responsible and what needs to be done.Â  For details see the [agenda](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_meeting).

We'll meet at freenode IRC in theÂ  #opensuse-project channel.

We'll update the [wiki](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_Planning_2011) as part of this.
