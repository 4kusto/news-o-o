![](/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/logos.png)Today, we will start a logo competition for openSUSE.Asia Summit 2017, which is going to be held in Tokyo, Japan. A logo is an essential material for the successful summit. As you have seen, the former openSUSE.Asia summits logos reflect the communities where the summit took place. Following tradition, we will have logo competition to collect great logos for this year’s summit.

The competition is open now and ends on August 14. The organizing team will send a “Geeko Mystery Box” as an appreciation for the best logo design.
