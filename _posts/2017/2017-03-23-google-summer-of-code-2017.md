We’re very happy to announce that openSUSE has been accepted as a mentoring organization for the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2017 edition!

[Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) is an annual program which awards stipends to university students to write code and learn about open source development in their summer break! Accepted students work with a mentor and become a part of the open source community.

In last year’s edition, [Ana Maria](https://gsocwithopensuse.wordpress.com/) worked on a project to improve the schedule of the [Open Source Event Manager](https://github.com/openSUSE/osem). We're proud to announce that Ana Maria will participate as a mentor again. If you're interested in web development and Ruby on Rails, check out the [projects around OSEM](https://github.com/openSUSE/mentoring/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AOSEM).

One of our all-time favorite projects participating in GSoC is YaST. openSUSE's default setup and configuration tool offers a project about rewriting [keyboard management](https://github.com/openSUSE/mentoring/issues/79) in a proper object-oriented way.

Compared to YaST, [Jangouts](https://github.com/jangouts/jangouts) is still a new project in the openSUSE family. Jangouts (for "Janus Hangouts") is a solution for videoconferencing based on WebRTC and AngularJS. While Jangouts participated the first time with only [one project](https://thingsofgeek.com/), we're happy that this year they offer [three new projects](https://github.com/openSUSE/mentoring/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3AJangouts+is%3Aopen).

The [application period](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) already started this Monday (March 20), and runs through April 4. Interested students should get in touch with the mentors and the community before starting to write an application proposal. Google will announce accepted students on May 4, and the official coding period will be from May 30 - August 29.

If you're interested in participating in Google Summer of Code, please visit our [openSUSE 101 mentoring website](//101.opensuse.org/gsoc/) for more information about projects and application.
