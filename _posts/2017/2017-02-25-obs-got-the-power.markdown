[![Old build workers, rack mounted](/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/OBS_Rack_Cloud_servers_backside.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/OBS_Rack_Cloud_servers_backside.jpg)

One year after introducing a new kind of Open Build Service worker machines, the "lambkins", the openSUSE Build Service got a big hardware refresh. The new machines, sponsored by SUSE, are equipped with:

- 2,8GHz AMD Opteron Processors (6348)

- 256 GB RAM

- one 120 GB SSD

Four of them are located in a chassis with a height of 2 units and run 12-16 workers on them (virtual machines, that are building packages).

That new build power allowed us to remove some of old machines from the pool. The unified hardware makes the management of the machines a lot easier now, even if there are still the most powerful old machines left.
