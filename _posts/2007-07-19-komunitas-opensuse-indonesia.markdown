Vavai wrote me today about some great new web site about openSUSE

The openSUSE Community in Indonesia has released their [blog](http://www.opensuse.or.id). This blog will contain everything about OpenSUSE, ie : news, tutorial, article, how-to and much more in Bahasa Indonesia. 

Thanks to Vavai and his friends for helping to make OpenSUSE an Indonesian mainstream distro.
