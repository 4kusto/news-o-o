![Packaging]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/rpm.png)

The [GNOME](http://opensuse.org/GNOME/Team) and [KDE](http://opensuse.org/KDE/Team) teams have teamed up to provide two [packaging days](http://en.opensuse.org/Packaging/Packaging_Day), from November 30th until December 1st (from any timezone to any timezone). It will take place on [IRC](http://opensuse.org/IRC) in the [**#opensuse-buildservice**](irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-buildservice) channel.

We will help interested newcomers and already experienced packagers in learning all the little tricks and bits needed for creating good openSUSE packages of your favourite application with the [openSUSE Build Service](http://opensuse.org/Build_Service). A little existing experience in compiling software from source is recommended, and the wiki page also lists several other useful things to read.

So join our effort in creating more packages for your favourite Linux Distribution!

Dirk Mueller and Michael Wolf
