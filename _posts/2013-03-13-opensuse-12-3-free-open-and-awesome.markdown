**Virtualization**
Virtualbox 4.2 brings support for limiting network IO bandwidth, improved 3D performance and better network device support. The KVM and Qemu updates to 1.3.0 vastly improved the USB stack with mass storage device and USB3 support as well as MSI/MSI-X support for the XHCI controller. This release includes the first major release of Boxes, an application for using remote systems and virtual machines.
