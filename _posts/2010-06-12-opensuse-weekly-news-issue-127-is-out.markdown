#### [**openSUSE News: An Update about the Strategy Proposals**](../2010/06/09/an-update-about-the-strategy-proposals/)




     "We wanted to give you an update regarding the status of our  Strategy Team™s release of strategy proposals for public discussion.   Truth is, despite our best intentions to release on this date, we failed  to realize each of our personal schedules leading up to this date.  For  many of us on the team, we had a number of commitments and didn™t  realize that most of us had scheduling conflicts. 
     We are 90% done completing the wording of our proposals.   While we could have rushed to finish everything by today, it was agreed  that quality of the proposals was more important than rushing to meet a  deadline.  As such, we have agreed to postpone the release for one  additional week until everyone is able to return to the table and  finalize our proposals." 



#### [**Pascal Bleser: Post shortening on planet.opensuse.org**](http://dev-loki.blogspot.com/2010/06/post-shortening-on-planetopensuseorg.html)




     "I just added a new feature on Planet openSUSE: articles with  more than 100 words are shorted (see the "...") and have an additional  "read more" link to read the full article on the host blog. 
     I hope that this will enhance the readability, as we keep  having massive entries that run across several screens (which, IMHO,  ruin the experience of having an aggregator). 
     Thanks to the Django developers from whom I blatantly stole  some code to do the tedious word wrapping in HTML." 



#### [**openSUSE Build Service 1.8 and 2.0 Announced**](../2010/06/09/opensuse-build-service-1-8-and-2-0-announced/)




     "The openSUSE Project is proud to announce the 1.8 and 2.0  releases of the openSUSE Build Service (OBS). It is an open package and  distribution development platform that provides a transparent  infrastructure that allows developers to build for various major Linux  distributions and hardware architectures. 
     The public server [http://build.opensuse.org](http://build.opensuse.org/) is available for all open source developers to build packages for the  most popular distributions including Debian, Fedora, Mandriva, openSUSE,  Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise and Ubuntu.

     "In boot.rootfsck and boot.localfs the return status of fsck is  stored in $FSCK_RETURN. The result determines the further boot process.  I suggest to ignore a return code 32 (user abort) in order to make a  fast boot possible if the user knows what he is doing (e.g. in case of a  fs check forced just by the number of boot cycles)."

     "Had a marvelous time at WriteCamp Milwaukee 2 Saturday. 
     Mercy Hill Church at the Hide House is a fantastic venue,  which you can see for yourself in the Flickr feed. The space was broken  up into five session areas: Two in the main sanctuary area, with  plenty of separation, so no one got confused by audio bleedthrough;  three smaller classrooms. 
     The whole conference had a pretty analog feel to it for this  techie. I brought my laptop, and lugged it around unopened pretty much  all day. I confined my notes to pen and paper."

    "The openSUSE presence will of course be amazing: just take a  look at our wiki page. Many contributors will have a talk, but we'll  also have workshops on the openSUSE booth (I recommend Robert's Learn  Inkscape Vector KungFu) and various interviews on RadioTux. And of  course, you can just come to the booth to meet us: we'll be happy to  share our enthusiasm with you! 
     On the GNOME side, we apparently couldn't find enough  volunteers in time to run a booth. That's a sad news, but we'll still  have many people attending the event, and we'll have several talks in  the Desktop track on Saturday. I know I won't miss Stormy's oneÂ :-)  (...)" 



### Hackweek  V





#### [Fridrich Strba: Hackweek V - Day 1](http://fridrich.blogspot.com/2010/06/hackweek-v-day-1.html)?




    "It is Hackweek V here at Novell. And as with all good things  that are supposed to start on Monday, and end on Friday, the best thing  is that they can start on Friday evening and go until the night becomes a  dawn on Monday morning. It is in this spririt that I started to do some  preparation to the long overdue release of libwpd libwpg and all  projects that are depending on these two. Already during the week-end I  fixed some obvious regressions in libwpg, caused by the complete API  rewrite. I added some callbacks to the libwpd's API, so that we can try  to support named styles during the 0.9.x series and will not have to  break ABI too soon (libwpd 0.8.x were API stable for about 5 years). And  today, I was playing with some more regressions and bugs found by sum1,  the best QA person that I know. (..:)" 



#### [Alexander Naumov: Hacking for Freedom](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/06/07/hacking-for-freedom/)




    "Hi developers! 
     These are first hours of hackweek. A lot of people in Novell  and in the community are starting to work on different projects. What  can I give for free software in this week? Sure, my favorite project is  NetworkManagement. (...)" 



#### [Federico Mena-Quintero: Wed 2010/Jun/09](http://www.gnome.org/%7Efederico/news-2010-06.html#09)




    "Hack Week 2010 ” Client-side awesome 
     It is Hack Week this week, when all of Novell's hackers work  on whatever project they want for the whole week. 
     The infrastructure for Document-Centric GNOME is coming along  just fine. The Zeitgeist hackers are kicking all sorts of ass with the  engine and the activity journal ” that's what lets you see your work in a  nice timeline. 
     Another part of the document-centric vision is to allow  comfortable flow or circulation through your files, which is sorely  missing right now." 



#### [SUSE Studio: Hackweek: Graphical client for SUSE Studio](http://blog.susestudio.com/2010/06/hackweek-graphical-client-for-suse.html)




    "This week is hackweek at SUSE. Originally I had planned to go  to Linuxtag, which also is this week, but unfortunately I'm not able to  follow that plan, so I'm making the best of it and take the opportunity  to hack away on a project I wanted to do for a long time already: A  graphical client for SUSE Studio. It's tracked as Feature 309733 in  openFATE. 
     I'm not going to replicate the functionality of the web  interface. This can easily be used through a browser. Maybe I will  experiment with embedding a browser component, but the main focus of the  client will be on those tasks which can't be done online. This is stuff  like managing downloads, running and deploying appliances locally,  natively connecting to testdrive, etc. I'm sure you have more ideas.  Don't hesitate to share them with me, if you like." 



#### [Josef Reidinger:LXDE](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/06/08/hackweek5/)




    "Hi, as hackweek continue I want to present my contribution for  this year event. My plan is to support our the youngest supported  desktop environment LXDE. So I contact our LXDE guy Andrea Florio and he  ask lxde developers. Then we communicate directly and I found as the  most intersting idea to replace gnome gvfs which is needed to have  usable gio interface in glib (geek-deserialization: allow easy access  remote systems, zip archives in file manager like it is part of  filesystem). Motivation for replacement is quite big gvfs dependency and  system resource requirements. It choose it because I can learn  something new, can return to programming in C from Ruby on Rails which  is used for webyast and last not least I think it is usable also for  another lightweight environment xfce4. (...)" 



#### [Hackweek V: Graphical SUSE Studio Client](http://blog.cornelius-schumacher.de/2010/06/hackweek-v-graphical-suse-studio-client.html)




    "Hackweek V is over and I can happily report success. My  graphical SUSE Studio client is functional and has the first cool  features implemented. The focus of the client is not to duplicate the  functionality of the SUSE Studio web interface, but to provide those  features, which are hard or not possible to do on the server. This is  stuff like managing downloads, running and deploying appliances locally,  or native access to testdrive. From this list I got the native  testdrive done. On the click of a button, the client starts a testdrive  on the SUSE Studio servers and then connects with an embedded native  client. This gives great performance and a very smooth and integrated  experience." 



#### [Klaas Freitag: Zippl “ a Lightweigth Presentation Tool](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/06/11/zippl-a-lightweigth-presentation-tool/)




    "Recently people played around a lot with a new kind of  presentations. The pages in the classical presentation tool sense seem  to lie around on a large canvas and while the presentation running, the  focus moves over the canvas and stops by interesting points. Zooming  allows to go more in detail and other cool graphics effects make it fun  to watch these presentations. 
     This week was the fifth Hackweek at Novell where we can pick  an interesting topic and work on it. I am always interested in cool  applications and I wanted to investigate a bit on Qts GraphicsView  anyway so I decided to go for a proof of concept implementation of a  lightweight but cool presentation tool following these concepts. (...)"

     "The second 2.6.35 prepatch has been released. "So -rc2 is out  there, and hopefully fixes way more problems than it introduces. I'm  slightly unhappy with its size - admittedly it's not nearly as big as  rc2 was the last release cycle, but that was an unusually big -rc2. And I  really hoped for a calmer release cycle this time." There's some new  drivers and a lot of fixes; the short-form changelog is in the  announcement, or see the full changelog for all the details."

    "The third 2.6.35 prepatch is out. "So I've been hardnosed now  for a week - perhaps overly so - and hopefully that means that  2.6.35-rc3 will be better than -rc2 was. Not only do we have a number of  regressions handled, we don't have that silly memory corruptor that bit  so many people with -rc2 and confused people with its many varied forms  of bugs it seemed to take, depending on just what random memory it  happened to corrupt." The short-form changelog is in the announcement,  or see the full changelog for all the details. Linus now evidently goes  offline for a little while, so the flow of changes into the mainline  will slow down. (...)"

     "The GNU find utility is one of the most useful commands you™ll  ever get to know. At first glance the options and syntax can seem  arcane. But, with a little practice, you™ll be able to locate any file  on your system with almost no trouble at all. To help you get started,  we™ve got 10 ways you can use find to get what you™re looking for. 
     Note that not all versions of find are created equal. The find  command you™ll use on Linux is slightly different than the find on  BSDs, Solaris, or Mac OS X. Much of the syntax is shared and can be used  between systems, but not all. (...)" 



#### [Linux.com/Joe Brockmeier: Getting a Grip on GNU grep](http://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/317617-getting-a-grip-on-gnu-grep)




     "If you™ve been using Linux for any amount of time, you™ve  probably heard about grep, though maybe you™re not familiar with using  it. GNU grep is a tool that lets you search one or more files, or  standard input. Simple, effective, and absolutely necessary for anyone  managing Linux and UNIX-type systems. Want to get a grip on grep? We™ll  get you started in no time. 
     The basics of grep are simple: to search for a given pattern,  run grep pattern file. This will look through one or more files and  return any lines that match the search pattern. Note that grep returns  lines of text and the filename, if you™re searching through files rather  than standard input or the output of another command."

#### [ZDNet/Vincent Danen: Set up Dropbox on a GUI-less Linux  server](http://www.zdnetasia.com/set-up-dropbox-on-a-gui-less-linux-server-62200499.htm)




     "[Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/) is a great  way to synchronize files across multiple machines. A free basic Dropbox  account gives you 2GB of storage, while pro paid accounts give you 50GB  or 100GB of storage space. Dropbox works great on desktops; there are  clients for Linux, Windows, and OS X. There are GUI tools provided to  manage the Dropbox and set it up for these operating systems. 
     But what happens if you want to link a Linux computer that  doesn't have a GUI? It is possible, with a bit of work, to make Dropbox  run without a GUI, allowing you to synchronize files with servers that  are running headless or where a user account may not be logged in all  the time."

If the words GRUB Error 2³ or No Valid System Disk Found  make you break into a cold sweat, then fear no more. Now you can include  the [Super Grub Disk](http://www.supergrubdisk.org/) in your geek arsenal, and say goodbye to boot errors. SGD can work with  Linux or Windows systems to bypass or repair the broken bootloaders  that have kept many of us awake at night, and all in under 2MB.

Linux  already had a ZFS port in userspace via FUSE, since license  incompatibilities between the CDDL and GPL prevent ZFS from becoming  part of the Linux kernel. [This  project](http://wiki.github.com/behlendorf/zfs/) solves the licensing issue by distributing ZFS as a separate  kernel module users will have to download and build for themselves."
