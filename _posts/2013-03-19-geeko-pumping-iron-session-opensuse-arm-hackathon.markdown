[![opensuse-arm](//news.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/opensuse-arm.png)](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:ARM)
Now that openSUSE 12.3 is out, the [openSUSE ARM Team](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:ARM) want to step up a gear. As the cycle was shorter than normal, there are a few wrinkles that need to be ironed out and also a whole heap of new things that can be added. After some discussion at FOSDEM, it was decided to hold a Hackathon to address these items. The Hackathon will take place on 8 to 12 April, both at the SUSE offices in Nuremberg as well as online for those that can't attend in person.<!-- more -->

We have a TODO list which comprises the following:



	
  * AArch64 fixes for 12.3 & Factory

	
  * Resolve outstanding 12.3 package issues

	
  * Test and release 12.3 images

	
  * Create OpenStack images for ARM

	
  * Get KVM and Xen on Chromebook & Arndale running

	
  * OBS improvements


There will also be the opportunity for new device bring up for those that want to, but our intention is to work through and complete as much of the above TODO list as possible first. For those interested in joining in the fun, please either join us in Nuremberg and/or join the [opensuse-arm mailing list, the ](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-arm)[#opensuse-arm IRC channel](irc://freenode.net/#opensuse-arm) on Freenode and also keep an eye on the openSUSE on the [ARM Trello board](https://trello.com/board/opensuse-on-arm/5007cfc12cf0ae352e21d8dc).

If you have any questions please let us know on the mailing list or on IRC.
