The openSUSE Project is pleased to announce the release of the [latest incarnation of openSUSE](http://software.opensuse.org), with support for 32-bit and 64-bit systems. [openSUSE 11.3](http://wiki.opensuse.org/Portal:11.3) is packed with new features and updates including [SpiderOak](https://spideroak.com/) to sync your files across the Internet for free, Rosegarden for free editing of your audio files, improved indexing with Tracker, and updates to Mozilla Firefox, and Thunderbird.

Among these many new features, openSUSE also provides support for netbooks and the Btrfs file system support. Users can expect to see improved hardware support with the 2.6.34 Linux kernel and updated graphics drivers. And support for the next generation of interactive computing  for touchscreens like the HP TouchSmart_._

openSUSE continues its tradition of delivering the popular KDE, GNOME and Xfce desktop environments, and now also provides the lightweight LXDE desktop environment. With GNOME, you can use the latest 2.30.1 version or take your installation for a drive with a preview of the upcoming GNOME 3.0. Or choose KDE SC 4.4.4 for the latest updates. They all feature the polish and integration that the openSUSE distro has been known for.
