On the 6th of December, the openSUSE marketing team held the first of three Collaboration Days. The goal of these days was to get on IRC together and get some tasks done. Each day was organized by a team of two volunteers who build up a list of possible task which on the day itself were to be picked up by the attendees.


## Results


Before talking about the material results, an important note: while indeed it was great to get so many things done, the most important was something else. Working together like this was fun. Really, the team spirit was great and everyone involved deserves a big kudos for simply being such a great person! During the 24 hours that the event took, some members were online for a much longer time than you could expect anyone to stay - true dedication! The meetings really showed what the spirit of Free Software and openSUSE means - making a difference together. Because we made a difference.<!-- more -->

Among other things, the following things were accomplished:

**Documentation created and updated:** organizing booths and launch parties; Ambassador documentation; Talking points; example Letters of Sponsorship; and a general WIKI reorganization and cleanup.
**Totally new:** two short presentations, one about SUSE Studio and one on OBS; short descriptions of openSUSE to be used in marketing materials; a series of keywords associated to openSUSE for SEO usage; a photo gallery showing openSUSE related images;

We also made significant strides in the feature list for openSUSE 11.4, which we hope to turn into an informative and fun to read feature guide for the release! Based on the work on short descriptions of openSUSE and the latest state of our Strategy, two folders are now in development: one for potential openSUSE users and one for potential contributors. Anyone interested in helping out: please contact us!

Moreover two short presentations on SUSE Studio and OBS were created which can be used in presentations from the Ambassadors. Already some Greek ambassadors are using them and they promised to contribute back translated versions.


## Thanks all!


We would like to thank the whole marketing team and everyone else who joined for a great job. We made a few significant steps forward and surely there will be more collaboration days in the future!
