![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/opensusecloud-300x173.png)Cloud images for [openSUSE Leap 42.2](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:42.2) are now available for Amazon Web Services (AWS EC2), Azure, Google Compute Engine and more cloud providers.

Last week, [openSUSE Leap 42.2](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/Cloud:Images:Leap_42.2) cloud image became available in the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01N4R3GJI?ref_=sm_catgtm_oss&adbsc=awsmarketplace_20170127_69687466&adbid=825064280949088256&adbpl=tw&adbpr=192929401) and within the past few weeks cloud images for [Azure](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Cloud:Images:Leap_42.2/openSUSE-Leap-42.2-Azure-Guest), [Google Compute Engine](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Cloud:Images:Leap_42.2/openSUSE-Leap-42.2-GCE-Guest) and [OpenStack](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Cloud:Images:Leap_42.2/openSUSE-Leap-42.2-OpenStack-rootfs) also became available.

"The project has been used extensively for cloud computing and we are excited that openSUSE is now listed in AWS Marketplace,” said Richard Brown, openSUSE Chairman. “We thank all the cloud providers for working with the openSUSE community to make this possible."

<!-- more -->End users can choose the cloud service provider that best fits their usage model, said openSUSE member James Mason. Leap is configured optimally for each cloud and will provide a consistent experience for users.

The most recent addition of the cloud images were made available for AWS.

AWS provides opportunities for business to sell solutions to AWS customers but, with openSUSE Leap 42.2, AWS customers have an opportunity to use openSUSE’s community software on AWS without any hourly-software instance charge.

Leap ships with tools for [uploading and managing images](https://www.suse.com/communities/blog/amazon-image-management-improved/) in AWS easy: tools that allow for uploading, publishing, deleting and deprecating images.

Cloud images of openSUSE have been available in AWS for years, but are new to the AWS’ Marketplace.

AWS Cloud users can run Docker containers in a Virtual Machine with openSUSE’s cloud image; this has been tested with SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12, which shares a common core with openSUSE Leap.
