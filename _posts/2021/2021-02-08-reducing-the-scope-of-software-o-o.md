We have some exciting news to share regarding the consolidation of our web pages.

We've decided to drop functionality behind <https://software.opensuse.org/distributions> and instead provide a redirect to <https://get.opensuse.org>.
Submit request can be found here <https://github.com/openSUSE/software-o-o/pull/943>.

Both sites were offering similar functionality for downloading install media. Both sites had to be updated with every Alpha, Beta, or changes to media descriptions. The new reduced scope of [software-o-o](https://software.opensuse.org) will be purely browsing of available software. The scope of [get-o-o](https://get.opensuse.org) won't change. It will be media downloads and pointers to relevant documentation such as installation or upgrade instructions. We believe that these changes will help to keep it small and simple.

We're happy to reduce duplication of efforts while not introducing further fragmentation as [get.opensuse.org](https://get.opensuse.org) has been around for quite some time already.

Efforts to make the changes were discussed as part of the [Web Development Sprint](https://news.opensuse.org/2021/01/28/web-development-sprints-to-start-next-week/) last week. There are descriptions for each distribution on [get.opensuse.org](https://get.opensuse.org) to better let new users understand the difference in each openSUSE Distribution. Changes to [software-o-o](https://software.opensuse.org) are also expected to be revamped in the future. 

The next [Web Development Sprint](https://news.opensuse.org/2021/01/28/web-development-sprints-to-start-next-week/) will take place on March 4 at 18:30 UTC on <https://meet.opensuse.org/websprints>. Notes from the sprint can be accessed at <https://etherpad.opensuse.org/p/websprints>.
