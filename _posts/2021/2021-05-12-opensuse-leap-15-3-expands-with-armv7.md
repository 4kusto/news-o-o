Developers of the [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) community are looking to utilize armv7l efforts in the context of [openSUSE Step](https://news.opensuse.org/2021/02/11/opensuse-new-project-looks-to-build-sle-on-more-architectures/) to evolve how [openSUSE Leap](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Leap) and [SUSE Linux Enterprise](https://www.suse.com/products/server/) are developed together.

The [Step effort](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Leap/openSUSE:Step) was announced in February to open up and expand architecture enablement for future SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE) releases.

Step is a community effort to rebuild SLE from the released sources packages in the openSUSE instance of the [Open Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/) (OBS) with the intention to stay as compatible as possible with SLE. Just recently the project established armv7l in [OBS](https://build.opensuse.org/) as a Leap port. 

"As the [survey's results](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:15.3/Surveys/ARM_Usecases) showed, Leap still has lots of armv7 users," said Guillaume Gardet, an arm developer and community contributor. "We listened to that feedback to address the potential use cases of people with armv7 and found a solution."

Leap ports provide Leap for architectures not supported by SLE, such as 32-bit architectures. Step armv7l together with [Backports](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Backports) forms the Leap port for armv7l.
