The [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) Project is trying to gather more information from open-source developers, development teams, packagers and maintainers through the latest [survey](https://survey.opensuse.org/) that will run from Oct. 7 until Oct. 29.

There are tools to monitor the health of packages, but the project doesn't have tools to monitor the health of packagers. 

Giving the floor to packagers, who are the dedicated working hands behind the betterment of distributions, will illuminate areas the openSUSE Project can improve upon to gain new contributors. The project wants to give the floor to the packagers so they can express as a group the challenges and complexities they face. 

The aim is to take this information and find ways to make their contributions more pleasant and rewarding. Apart from the typical demographics questions, there are questions about tooling, contributions and  contributor satisfaction.

Visit <https://survey.opensuse.org/> to take the survey today.
