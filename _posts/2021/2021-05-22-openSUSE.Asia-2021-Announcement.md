India was accepted to host the openSUSE.Asia Summit 2020. Due of Covid 19 pandemic we had to cancel the event.
As the world has shifted from physical mode to digital made, we with the support of openSUSE.Asia committee
members proposed to organize openSUSE.Asia summit 2021 in online mode. We are glad that our proposal is accepted by
openSUSE board. 

The supporters of openSUSE in India, and  of Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) at large are excited to organize 
the most awaited openSUSE.Asia Summit event. In this activity, experts, contributors, end users, and technology enthusiasts 
will gather to share experiences about the development of openSUSE and other things related to FLOSS and have a lot of fun.
The venue for the openSUSE.Asia Summit was chosen after being proposed by the Indian community during 
[openSUSE.Asia Summit 2019](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/summitasia19) in Bali, Indonesia. The 
[Asian committee](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Asia_Organization_Committee) decided Faridabad as the host of 
openSUSE.Asia Summit 2021 from August 6 to August 8, 2021, at 
[Manav Rachna International Institute of Research & Studies, Faridabad](https://manavrachna.edu.in/international-institute-of-research-and-studies/).\
Goals to be achieved in the online openSUSE.Asia Summit 2021 include:  
* To promote openSUSE in India.
* To attract new contributors for openSUSE from India and other Asian countries.
* To provide an alternative to the wider community that FLOSS can be a powerful tool for doing their daily job.
* To provide a platform for sharing user and developer experiences.

<h5>Pre-announcement</h5>

openSUSE.Asia Summit 2021 will immediately open a call for paper for prospective speakers.

to this activity. More details about the above information will be informed in the near future through [news.opensuse.org](https://news.opensuse.org).\
