Our [survey](https://survey.opensuse.org/) about the release of [openSUSE Leap 15.3](https://get.opensuse.org/leap/) has ended and the results will be discussed in a release retrospective at the [openSUSE Conference](https://events.opensuse.org/) in the coming days.

“I'd like to give big thanks to all of those who participated…,” wrote release manager Lubos Kocman in an [email](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/A7AGYKHEQKTPCPWIG3LMXSBZZEUQ57MK/). “We've received 605 responses, which is almost 200 more than in 15.2. I'm grateful for the increased participation as it shows us that it makes sense to have this type of feedback loop.”

Kocman will give a [talk at the openSUSE Conference](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSVC21/program/proposals/3479/) on June 19 at 09:00 UTC and discuss the results. 

[Project](https://www.opensuse.org/) members and participants of the conference and survey are encouraged to join. 

“We'll schedule some more public rounds on [meet.o.o](https://meet.opensuse.org/) as well, as you can't review all of (the) feedback (plus) create action items in a single session,” he wrote.

For those interested in the raw data from the survey, it is available on the [wiki page](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:15.3/Retrospective).
