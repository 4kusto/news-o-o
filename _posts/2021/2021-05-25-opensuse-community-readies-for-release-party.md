The [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) Project is planning to have a 24-hour release party in the [openSUSE Bar](https://meet.opensuse.org/bar) immediately after the release of [openSUSE Leap 15.3](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:15.3).

The virtual release party will have members of the release team, community members and board members in attendance. 

Beginning at 12:00 UTC on June 2, the release party will go until 11:59 UTC on June 3. Participants are expected from several countries and people are welcome to attend and meet with openSUSE members. 

The event gives people an opportunity to get to know people involved in the project and contributors who help with the release of the openSUSE Leap. distribution. The event also offers the community an opportunity to meet, socialize and casually discuss the release after more than six month of development.
