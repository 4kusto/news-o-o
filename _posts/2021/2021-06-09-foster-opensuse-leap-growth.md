The release party in the [openSUSE bar](https://meet.opensuse.org/bar) continues on more than a week after the release of [openSUSE Leap 15.3](https://get.opensuse.org/leap/), yet that’s not the only thing soaring for the [project](https://www.opensuse.org/). 

The adaptation of the new release continues to show a steady increase on [metrics.opensuse.org](https://metrics.opensuse.org) as a pattern trends up and to the right with 40,000 installations a week after the release. Major increases in adaption traditionally happen within a few months after a release as users are expected to upgrade to the latest minor release within six months of its availability.

An area where the project can use help is with the promotion of [openSUSE Leap 15.3](https://get.opensuse.org/leap/). Users can find new [Leap flyers](https://github.com/openSUSE/artwork/tree/master/flyers/flyer_153) in the [github artwork repository](https://github.com/openSUSE/artwork) along with updated banners and a new [Leap image](https://github.com/openSUSE/artwork/blob/master/logos/distros-prototype/leap.png).

Community marketing has been emphasizing the use of Leap on servers, workstations, desktops and for virtualization and container use. Migration projects and user acceptance testing also benefit from the newest Leap. Large development teams can run and test workloads that can be lifted and shifted to SUSE Linux Enterprise Linux 15 Service Pack 3 for long-term maintenance if needed. The newest minor version is rock-solid and simple to upgrade from Leap 15.2. openSUSE Leap 15.3 is built with the exact same binary packages as SLE.

The community is supportive and engages with people who use Leap through community channels like the [mailing lists](https://lists.opensuse.org), [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#newscom:opensuse.org), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/opensuse), [Telegram](https://t.me/openSUSE_group) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/opensuseproject). Help to promote the release by giving a review on [DistroWatch](https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=opensuse) or do a review of the release through a video or blog. 

The release team also wants users’ feedback and can take a [survey](https://survey.opensuse.org/) about the release until June 16.
