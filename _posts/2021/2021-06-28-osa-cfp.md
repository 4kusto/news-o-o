<p>It is a pleasure to announce the call for papers for openSUSE.Asia summit 2021.
Starting today, the openSUSE.Asia Committee is looking forward to seeing your proposals. 
The committee is looking for speakers from different avenues of life, representing and 
advocating Free and Open Source Software. openSUSE.Asia Summits are organized every year 
to promote the use of free and open source software. It is one of the most appreciated 
events for the openSUSE community (i.e., both contributors and users) in Asia. 
This year’s event will be an online event and will prove to be a great platform for 
enthusiasts and users alike.</p>

<p>Following the last Asia Summit in Bali, the seventh openSUSE.Asia Summit 2021 will
be held by openSUSE India Team on August 6th- 8th, 2021. The past Asia Summits received
major participation from Indonesia, China, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and India.
By harnessing the power of the internet, we wish to make this online event a huge success.
We hope to see members of the community sharing their most recent knowledge, 
experiences, and learn about FLOSS technologies surrounding openSUSE.</p>

<h5>Topics</h5>
openSUSE.Asia Summit 2021 will invite talks relevant to openSUSE and other topics
like Cloud, Virtualization, Container, Container Orchestration, Linux desktop environments
and applications since openSUSE is a collection of various FLOSS products.

 * Desktop environments and applications (e.g. GNOME, KDE, XFCE)
 * Office suite, graphic art, multimedia (e.g. LibreOffice, Calligra, GIMP, Inkscape)
