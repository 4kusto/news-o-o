Snapshot releases of [openSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org/) [Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/) began to flow this week for the rolling release.

Moving past last weekâ€™s build failures and the obstacles with the ISO media size being excessively large, three snapshots were released this week.

The latest [20210824](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/TI4L56TZS6TVK4GOA5A56JGLJDJQH7TC/) snapshot updated [Mozilla Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net) from version 78.13.0 to version 91.0.1, which is the next Extended Support Release codebase. The new email client offers many [new features](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/91.0/releasenotes/#whatsnew) like keyboard shortcuts to access To/CC/BCC fields and a PDF JavaScript viewer is now included in Thunderbird. Two major version updates were in the snapshot; an update to [nftables](https://netfilter.org/projects/nftables/) 1.0.0  now recognizes the command-line option `--define`. [GTK](https://www.gtk.org/) based volume control tool [pavucontrol](https://freedesktop.org/software/pulseaudio/pavucontrol/) 5.0 has support for switching Bluetooth codecs that comes new in [PulseAudio](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/) 15.0, which was released in the [20210823](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/K2LJ7BDXF6X2QU3VPNW3LMSHTD5VQWCB/) snapshot 24-hours earlier. [GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/) was updated to version 11.2 and fixed the One-time Passwords In Everything package with [glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/) 2.34. A few [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) and [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) packages were updated in the snapshot. Command-line utility [grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) updated to version 3.7, which skipped the stack overflow tests in the [qemu](https://www.qemu.org/) build. The runtime [nodejs16](https://nodejs.org/en/) 16.6.2 update fixed the improper handling of untypical characters in domain names and fixed three [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

The network-detector, packet-sniffer, and intrusion-detection package [Kismet](https://www.kismetwireless.net/) updated to its latest 2021.08 version in snapshot [20210823](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/K2LJ7BDXF6X2QU3VPNW3LMSHTD5VQWCB/); the packages made some small improvements and has a new Wireless Intrusion Detection System alert. [PulseAudio](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/) 15.0 dropped several BlueTooth patches and improved hardware support. PDF rendering package [poppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/) 21.08.0 added an [Application Programming Interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) to allow the addition and modification of outlines into a PDF. An updated 1.9.7 version of [sudo](https://www.sudo.ws/) enabled [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) support for a secure central session recording collection. And [yast2-bootloader](https://yast.opensuse.org/) 4.4.6 replaced [mkinitrd](https://linux.die.net/man/8/mkinitrd) with [dracut](https://dracut.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page).

The [20210820](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/UCB426DWSMO5HVMFEHXTMBSDLJ54SIVE/) snapshot updated the [Linux Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/) to version 5.13.12, which had several network device support fixes. The update of [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org) 91.0.1 fixed an issue that caused tabs from private windows to be visible in non-private windows and it had several CVE fixes in the updated browser version. The update of [python38 3.8.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3811/) addressed some security issues and fixed a regression introduced in the previous version. Updated graphics package [Mesa](https://www.mesa3d.org/) 21.2.0 enabled the Gallium3D OpenGL driver in case there is an issue with some video hardware acceleration. Other packages to update in the snapshot were document reader [okular 21.08.0](https://okular.kde.org/), [libstorage-ng](https://github.com/openSUSE/libstorage-ng) 4.4.35,  [diffutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/) 3.8 and several  [YaST](https://yast.opensuse.org/) packages.
