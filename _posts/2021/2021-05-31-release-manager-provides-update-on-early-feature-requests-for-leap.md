The release manager of [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) [Leap](https://get.opensuse.org/leap) is finishing up the release of [Leap 15.3](https://get.opensuse.org/leap), but wants to keep contributors and developers informed about an early feature request deadline for the Leap 15.4 release. 

Early feature requests are important since Leap is compatible with [SUSE Linux Enterprise](https://www.suse.com/products/server/) and the early feature request deadline for Service Pack 4 is June 26. 

“This is very important to openSUSE Leap 15.4 contributors as 1/3 of Leap 15.4 binaries will be re-used with SUSE Linux Enterprise and therefore submit requests are accepted there,” wrote release manager Lubos Kocman on a [project email list](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/S3QFUB3CFWKP2KAHV63DG2QKYRQOPNQ5/). “Just to clarify, this deadline is the same for everyone, be it a largest partner, community contributor or an employee.”

openSUSE Leap and Package Hub exclusive packages will have similar deadlines as described in the [roadmap]( https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Roadmap). 

“We're aiming for the Leap 15.4 GA in early June 2022, therefore deadlines will only slightly vary from the previous release,” Kocman wrote.

This communication is mainly to identify very obvious updates or requests for features that people would like to have in SLE 15 SP4 and therefore inherited to openSUSE Leap 15.4. Requests during later development cycles have a bit more complicated path but there are [processes for it](https://en.opensuse.org/ECO). These processes have a bit more complications to pass and it generally takes longer, so please request features early. Requests don't mean that code submissions have to be ready, but it does mean an issue for it is created.

“I'm processing requests together with Neal Gompa and others who join our [call on Mondays](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Jump/Policy/CommunitySLEChangeRequests#Weekly_reviews_of_open_features),” Kocman wrote.

If developers are unsure, simply join the call.
