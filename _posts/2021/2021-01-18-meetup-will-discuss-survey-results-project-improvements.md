The [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) Project welcomes our followers to participate in two planned meetups to discuss results from the [End of the Year Community Survey](https://en.opensuse.org/End-of-year-surveys/2020/Data) on Jan. 23 and Jan. 30. 

Both sessions will start at 13:00 UTC on openSUSE’s Jitsi instance and go for 1:30 hours.

Members of the [“let’s improve the openSUSE learning experience”](https://news.opensuse.org/2020/10/12/join-our-team-and-help-us-imporove-the-openSUSE-learning-experience/) initiative will share [results](https://en.opensuse.org/End-of-year-surveys/2020/Data) and analysis from the survey. 

The meetup is designed to discuss ways the community can improve upon areas identified in the results as either a weakness or needing improvement. 

Topics that will be discussed in the Jan. 23 session include: 

* Address pain points
* Knowledge transfer
* Promotion (How are they learning about projects)

Topics to be discussed in the Jan. 30 session include: 

* Tools driving switchers to openSUSE (Where are users coming from)
* Discuss flagship project/s
* Expanding global users
* Increasing diversity
* Increase usage with people under 34

The meetup will take place at <https://meet.opensuse.org/EOY2020>.
