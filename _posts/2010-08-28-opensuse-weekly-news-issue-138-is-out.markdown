####  [Andreas Jaeger: Revising the Board Election Rules](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/08/25/revising-the-board-election-rules/)


"Last years election of seats for the openSUSE board showed that our election rules are not complete. So, before the elections this year start, I propose that we refine the rules and like to start with this post a discussion on how to change them.  I see the following situations not handled: 


  * Less candidates than seats for a category (Novell/non-Novell) 


  * Equal number of candidates and open seats for a category (Novell/non-Novell) 


  * a board member resigning 


  * a board member disappearing and not engaging in the board 


  * a board member getting hired by Novell or leaves Novell 

We also need to clarify when the new board constitutes."

"Now that ARM support in the OBS is getting more mature, here a report on the Status of PowerPC and MIPS builds using QEMU. They are implemented similiar to the ARM solution, and use QEMU Usermode (to allow speedup with x86 based cross compilers like we do for ARM).  First of all, PowerPC native builds do work since a long time (3+ years). At the beginning, only XEN virtualization was available for OBS, and XEN did not work on PowerPC hardware. Recently, KVM autosetup was added to OBS with release 1.8. KVM also works on PowerPC machines, so there are now fully functional PowerPC native builds with virtual machine support available."

####  [Sebastian KÃ¼gler: Demystifying Akonadi](http://vizzzion.org/blog/2010/08/demystifying-akonadi/)


"The exotic-sounding â€˜Akonadiâ€™ refers to both a mythological figure and the KDE platformâ€™s central information framework. This article will dispel some of the mystery about how Akonadi will improve performance and integration, and how it is being rolled out into KDE applications. Iâ€™ll also provide some insight how the technology works, and what will become possible with this new PIM framework.  Many people have been asking what the status of the new, Akonadi-based Kontact Groupware suite is. As Iâ€™ve been working closely with the PIM hackers, I thought Iâ€™d give my readers a heads-up on whatâ€™s going on and what to expect. In this article, I will often take KMail as an example for the port, but similar things apply to the other PIM applications that form the Kontact suite as well."

Our main goals were, among other things, to improve our UI Automation Client API implementation, polish the interaction with at-spi2, better Moonlight accessibility and to handle custom and client-side providers. The great work made by all the contributors was the reason this release accomplished those goals."

It contains numerous performance related enhancements and is at least twice faster in JPEG compression/decompression than original libjpeg on platforms with MMX/SSE instruction set. It has same API/ABI like original libjpeg and also runs on non-SSE platforms where is around 25% faster.

"Last weekend took FrOSCon place and openSUSE had a great presentation there. It was the 5th FroSCon and I was there since the second. FrOSCon addresses more developer and so its the best way to make a simple booth there for presenting openSUSE. FrOSCon offers projects rooms for making ther own program in there. Projects like PHP, Django, Perl, Geany and some others used the offer. After LinuxTag I said to Henne let us take an developer room too, we can make what we want in there, we have only what we do in it."  


####  [Will Stephenson: openSUSE Boosters at FrOSCon, Day 2](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/08/22/opensuse-boosters-at-froscon-day-2/)


"Back home in Nuernberg now â€“ Sunday has been a long day of hacking on Elgg and its plugins to shape it into a users site that knows about the social side of the openSUSE community.  Our â€˜Hack Meckâ€™ was a little bit harder after letting loose at the legendary FrOSCon Saturday night party in the balmy August air, but we still managed to put down the glow sticks, hammer the keys and reach our goals for the weekend. These were adapting the user data to include fields that are peculiar to openSUSE such as membership status and IRC cloak, enhancing the Poll plugin to meet our info gathering needs, adapting the Elgg theming to our ubiquitous Bento theme, and working on calendaring and events so that we all know what is coming next in openSUSE world and so you can display your packaging and bug-reporting achievements to the world."

"Dear openSUSE contributor and enthusiast, Is Marketing important for Free Software development? I hope to reach an answer in openSUSE Conference 2010 with the community and help the openSUSE Community to develop their own concepts of Marketing. I believe this is a very sensible and important task that I could accomplish with your help and participation on my small presentation.  My presentation will target â€˜The Concept of Marketing and FOSS Developmentâ€™ and it goal is to establish a Concept of Marketing that can be developed by the openSUSE Community based on a set of small concepts defined by Marketing, such as: trade, value, consumer or processes."

####  [Packman: imagination 2.1.1](http://packman.links2linux.org/package/imagination/183673)


"Imagination is a lightweight and simple DVD slide show maker written in C language and built with the GTK+2 toolkit. I noticed a lack on the Linux platform of a user-friendly DVD slide show maker, so I started developing Imagination. True, there are some other GUIs which do the job, but they usually require a lot of dependencies to be installed first. Imagination has been designed from the ground up to be fast, light and easy-to-use. It requires the ffmpeg encoder ONLY to produce the movie file - to be burned to DVD then with another application. Yes you don't need any other third-party software, I like the KISS principle :) Imagination at present features 26 transitions effects developed as plugins loaded at startup. Exporting of the slideshow as FLV format is supported. No sound and Ken Burns effects yet but they are planned in the next release."

###  For Desktop Users





####  [makeuseof.com/Justin Pot: BleachBit â€“ A Utility To Clean Up Your Linux System](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/bleachbit-utility-clean-linux-system/)


"Itâ€™s no secret: many programs fill your hard drive with well-meaning, but useless, crap. From browser caches to install leftovers to logs, computers are full of unnecessary information.  Windows users can turn to CCleaner â€“ a program that can make your computer run faster - to systematically remove such fluff from their drive. But what about Linux users who need to wipe and clean their Linux machine?" You can find bleachbit in our Repositories: [http://bit.ly/a1oiiK](http://bit.ly/a1oiiK) 


###  For Commandline/Script Newbies





####  [Linux Journal/LJ Staff: Stupid tar Tricks](http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/stupid-tar-tricks)


"One of the most common programs on Linux systems for packaging files is the venerable tar. tar is short for tape archive, and originally, it would archive your files to a tape device. Now, you're more likely to use a file to make your archive. To use a tarfile, use the command-line option -f . To create a new tarfile, use the command-line option -c. To extract files from a tarfile, use the option -x. You also can compress the resulting tarfile via two methods. To use bzip2, use the -j option, or for gzip, use the -z option. (...)"

###  For Developers and Programmers





####  [IBM developerWorks/Wei Dong Xie: Avoiding memory leaks in POSIX thread programming](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-memory-leaks/)


"POSIX thread programming defines a standard set of C programming language types, functions, and constantsâ€”and pthreads provide a powerful tool for thread management. To use pthreads to the fullest, you'll want to avoid the common mistakes. One common mistake is forgetting to join joinable threads, which can create memory leaks and cause extra work. In this tips-oriented article, learn the basics of POSIX threads, see how to identify and detect thread memory leaks, and get solid advice for avoiding them." 


  







###  For System Administrators





####  [Jared Ottley: Alfresco: Permissions Web Scripts](http://feeds.ottleys.net/%7Er/jaredottley/%7E3/kQP5f3fZqJA/alfresco-permissions-web-scripts)


"A couple of months back I was asked to write a couple of web scripts to help one of our customers to be able to check and modify permissions for content/spaces in the Alfresco repository. Iâ€™ve finally had the chance to spend sometime testing and now writing about them.  The core of the web scripts was quick to write. The fun (more time consuming) part was working with exception handling in javascipt. I know tons of fun right! There are few different ways to use exception handling based on which version of Alfresco you are using. The customer is on Enterprise 3.1 and I wanted to make sure that the web scripts also worked on the more current releases of Alfresco as well. A change (re: addition) was made in Enterprise 3.2.1 and Community 3.3 to help simplify exception handeling. Iâ€™ll talk about exception handling and these differences in a follow up post. For now letâ€™s talk about these new web scripts."

"If you are brave enough feel free to update to Firefox 4.0b4 from the mozilla:beta repository. It will not install in parallel to previous versions but will replace your existing Firefox package. As always you want to backup your profile before so you can go back to your previous version without problems.  The latest package contains the KDE integration patches we had in FF3.x which are pretty much untested. So if you run KDE and want to give it a try please report issues you find in Novellâ€™s Bugzilla."

I traveled home on Monday morning and then took Tuesday off, so I had some catching up to do...  As for the past years, FrOSCon rocked again! According to the closing keynote, they had around 1.500 (unique) visitors and I had a great time there. I really enjoyed meeting all the old and new faces of the various Open Source communities. The lineup of speakers was excellent, Jon "maddog" Hall's keynote about "Free and Open Source Software in the Developing World" was quite insightful and inspiring."

Since some years big software companies like Microsoft (2002) or Cisco (2010) start changing their software development procedures to address the massive amount of vulnerabilities in their products. MS seems to be successful with this strategy and all the charts, numbers and articles look promising. "But what about the open-source world, the world of Linux distributions, what did they do?" you might ask. Led me shed some light on it."

"My life is getting far too complex to handle simply. Fall is coming, and Iâ€™m beginning to think Iâ€™m overbooking myself. Consider this: 


  * Iâ€™m working on another book project that I canâ€™t talk about yet. ;-) 


  * Iâ€™m way behind in working through the SitePoint web development classes I wrote about a few weeks ago. 


  * Iâ€™m speaking to the Madison Linux Users Group (MadLUG) about openSUSE 11.3 on November 6 (Did I mention that before?), and have to create that presentation. 


  * Iâ€™m probably leading at least one session at BarCampMilwaukee 5 (which I did mention last week) October 2-3. The minimum is likely to be a dress rehearsal for the MadLUG event, but stillâ€¦ 


  * I want to write more magazine articles too. 


  * I have to get another car (an unexpected and urgent task). 


  * There may be still another book project after the one at the top of this list that requires a bunch of preparatory tasks. 


  * Iâ€™ve got to mow the lawn weekly and tend to various other homeowner projects. 


  * Oh, and BTW I still have a day job that fills in 40 hours every week. 

Now between the Web-based app ToodleDo and a lovely Windows-based desktop app called MyLifeOrganized (MLO) that runs pretty well in Wine, Iâ€™ve got my day-to-day task/to-do-lists in good order. But right now, I need something that can help me figure out how to fit all of these big projects into the amount of time left in the day once I get home at night. And, since it is fall, ideally allow me to catch a few football and postseason baseball games in the bargain."

"As many of you may already know, a few minutes ago we pushed a Qt 4.7 Release Candidate (RC). Qt 4.7 is a great step forward with regard to performance and the introduction of Qt Quick, and with Qt 4.7 we will see Qt applications run faster and smother than ever before.  With the release of Qt 4.7 including Qt Quick, you will immediately gain access to powerful features for building fluid, animated applications and UIs. Qt Quick is made up of three pieces: (1) the QML language and (2) the QtDeclarative module in the Qt framework, and (3) Qt Quick tooling components in Qt Creator."

"Recently I had the pleasure of chatting with newly minted openSUSE community manager, and former KDE marketing lead, Jos Poortvliet about user-visible changes brought in the KDE 4.5 release. We asked him ten questions about changes in KDE 4.5, what problems needed to be overcome, and what the future of KDE looks like â€” and his thoughts on openSUSE.  Jos Poortvliet was hired by Novell as openSUSE community manager in early August. Before that he was active as volunteer in the international KDE community as marketing team lead. He coordinated and contributed to the work around releases, creation of marketing materials, visiting and organizing conferences, and maintaining contacts with the press. In his "real" life he worked as business consultant at companies like Royal Bank of Scotland, the dutch Governmental Department of Education and KPN, a major dutch Telecom provider."

Such was the case today when I came across this well-written piece from the Royal Pingdom Blog referenced on Linux Today. Itâ€™s about the failure of desktop Linux to break the 1% market share barrier, and I confess that it left me a little depressed. But I decided to add my two cents on the subject anyhow."
