The openSUSE Education team is proud to present **openSUSE-Edu Li-f-e** (Linux for Education) based on [openSUSE 11.4](http://en.opensuse.org/11.4). The image is a "hybrid" iso image which can be used to burn a Live DVD or to create a [Live USB stick](http://en.opensuse.org/Live_USB_stick).

This release includes the latest carefully selected software for  students,  educators as well as parents. The software selection  encompasses  everything required to make a productive computing experience e for either  home or  educational use without having to install anything additional. We plans to update the Edu Li-f-e 11.4 image regularly with both official updates from openSUSE 11.4 and from the education project.

And education administrators will love the inclusion of highly-regarded server applications such as Moodle, ATutor, and FreeSMS.Â Â  Deploying services for your institution with the underlying rock solid stable openSUSE 11.4 operating system has never been better!

With the [KIWI-LTSP](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:KIWI-LTSP) server you can PXE (network) boot other PCs to use this live DVD without   installing or modifying anything on them. Booting from hard disk again   will leave those PCs as they were. (Please note that running LTSP from   Live DVD/USB is meant for demo/testing purpose only, install on the  hard  disk to use it in production).

This distribution includes LAMP stack (LAMP stands for Linux, Apache,   MySQL and PHP) that is needed for developing or hosting PHP websites  and  all other major development tools. It also provides a rich  multimedia experience out of the box.
