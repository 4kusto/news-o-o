The openSUSE Project is pleased to announce [the release of openSUSE 11.2](http://software.opensuse.org/).Â  openSUSE 11.2 includes new versions of GNOME, KDE, OpenOffice.org, Firefox, the Linux kernel, and many, many more updates and improvements. In 11.2 you'll find more than 1,000 open source desktop applications. openSUSE also includes a full suite of server software and a rich selection of open source development tools.

You can find a bevy of [screenshots](http://en.opensuse.org/Screenshots/11.2) and more on the openSUSE wiki, and a lengthy list of packages and version numbers on [DistroWatch](http://distrowatch.com/suse).

Let's take a look at some of the more interesting features of openSUSE 11.2!


## openSUSE Desktop


As always, openSUSE provides everything you need to get started with Linux on the desktop.

openSUSE 11.2 includes KDE 4.3 as the "default" desktop. If you install from DVD without changing anything, you'll have the KDE desktop by default. However, we still provide GNOME as an equal choice, and Xfce and other window managers as alternative desktops too!

KDE 4.3 is a major update to the KDE platform. It includes improved networking support, and work to make Firefox and OpenOffice.org better integrated with the KDE enviroment. The openSUSE Project also worked closely with the KDE Project on theming and branding to provide a look and feel that meshes both projects nicely.

You'll also find plenty of GNOME greatness in openSUSE 11.2 as well. GNOME 2.28, the latest release of the popular GNOME desktop, is included with 11.2. This release includes a brand new theme, improved software update application, improvements in GNOME's Webcam and video application, and many other enhancements and improvements to prepare the GNOME platform for GNOME 3.0 in 2010.

OpenOffice.org 3.1 is a complete office productivity suite compatible with Microsoft Office. This release includes improvements in change tracking and collaboration in Writer, and major improvements to the drawing application.

Social networking gets a boost in 11.2 with the addition of GNOME and KDE microblogging clients that handle multiple social network sites, [Gwibbe](http://en.opensuse.org/Gwibber)r, and [Choqok](http://www.dissociatedpress.net/2009/11/12/microblogging-with-choqok-in-opensuse-11-2/).

With openSUSE 11.2, you have the ability to install GNOME or KDE live media from USB, and numerous improvements to make openSUSE 11.2 much better on netbooks.


## Under the Hood


The desktop improvements are the most noticeable, but there's plenty going on under the hood as well in openSUSE 11.2.

Storage improvements include the ability to encrypt the entire hard disk, for users concerned about data security. Users can also take advantage of the next generation of filesystems for Linux with Ext4 or btrfs. In case you'd like to learn more about the new kernel features you can go at [KernelNewbies.org](http://kernelnewbies.org/LinuxChanges) and have a look at the "cool stuff" part.

Want to manage remote openSUSE servers with a Web interface? That day is coming soon! openSUSE 11.2 users can [install](http://en.opensuse.org/YaST/Web/Installation) the first technology preview of WebYaST: a Web-based remote administration tool for openSUSE systems.

Finally, you can upgrade in-place using Zypper! Though it's been possible to do an upgrade in place for some time, with caution, it's finally a "recommended" method of upgrade with openSUSE 11.2. For users who want to move from 11.1 to 11.2 using "zypper dup," see [Andreas Jaeger's post on Lizards](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2009/10/01/updating-in-place-from-opensuse-11-1-to-11-2/) about the process. It's quick, it's easy, and almost competely painless.


## Linux for Education


The openSUSE Build Service provides thousands of applications as 1-click packages to enhance your experience on openSUSE 11.2. The openSUSE Education Community provides hundreds of Educational applications suitable for students of all ages, parents, teachers and IT administrators of educational institutions via the Build Service.

The 11.2 release will be followed closely by a very special spin, Li-f-e: Linux for Education. Li-f-e contains GNOME, KDE as well the the award-winning Sugar learning environment for children. With packages from the Packman repository, Li-f-e provides everything required to get rich multimedia experience too.


## Media and Download


openSUSE is now available for immediate download! You have several choices of installation media and live CDs (which are also installable).



	
  * openSUSE 11.2 Installable DVD 32-bit

	
  * openSUSE 11.2 Installable DVD 64-bit

	
  * openSUSE 11.2 GNOME 32-bit Live CD

	
  * openSUSE 11.2 GNOME 64-bit Live CD

	
  * openSUSE 11.2 KDE 32-bit Live CD

	
  * openSUSE 11.2 KDE 64-bit Live CD


**Booting openSUSE 11.2 from a USB key**: get one of the Live CDs  available above, and can copy it to a USB key with the following  command:

    
    <strong>dd if=image.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M</strong>


Replace "image.iso" with the name of the ISO image that you have  downloaded, and replace "sdX" with the actual device name of your USB  drive. Be careful! This will erase the target device, so make sure you  have the correct device name and have any vital data backed up!

## Thanks!


openSUSE 11.2 represents the combined effort of hundreds of  developers who participate in openSUSE, and thousands of developers in  upstream projects that are shipped in openSUSE. The contributors, inside  and outside the openSUSE Project, should be proud of this release, and  they deserve a major "thank you" for all of the hard work and care that  have gone into 11.2.

When we say "contributor," we don't mean only developers and  packagers. This includes translators, openSUSE Ambassadors, the openSUSE  Board, and the users who help power our forums and support users who  are taking their first steps into Linux.

We are confident that openSUSE 11.2 is the best openSUSE release yet,  and that it will help to encourage the use of Linux everywhere! We hope  that you **_have a lot of fun_** while you use openSUSE 11.2!
