This Wednesday the 2nd openSUSE Conference 2010 opens its doors and we are very happy to announce the third keynote today.

_**The Desktop and the Cloud - Thoughts about Freedom** on Thursday morning at 9:30 am. How relevant is the desktop in a world where computing is happening in the cloud?_ 

The motto for our conference is one of the basic ideas of openSUSE: _Collaboration across borders_. This is why we are especially proud to have this subject addressed in a keynote by two key people from the free desktop world: Cornelius Schumacher, president of KDE e.V., and Vincent Untz, former president of the GNOME Foundation.

They'll show how KDE and GNOME evolved on their mission to bring user-friendly Free Software to users, where they stand today, and why the Free Desktop is needed to protect our freedoms in a cloudy world.

Our yearly conference is free of charge, offers interesting talks and gives you the best chance to meet many cool people in person!
