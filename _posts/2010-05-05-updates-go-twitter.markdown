For our openSUSE distributions, we release regularly updates to fix security issues and general bugs.Â  As desktop user, you get notified in GNOME and KDE via the updater apps about new packages once they run (normal setup is once a day).

Security announcements are send out via the opensuse-security-announce mailing list (subscribe via [lists.opensuse.org](http://lists.opensuse.org)).Â  To get informed about all updates as soon as they are released, you can read the opensuse-updates mailing listÂ  (subscribe via [lists.opensuse.org](http://lists.opensuse.org/)) and now follow also the new Twitter user [ @openSUSE_Update](http://twitter.com/openSUSE_Update) [![Follow openSUSE_Update on Twitter](http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-a.png)](http://www.twitter.com/openSUSE_Update).

We also have two RSS feeds: [openSUSE Maintenance  All Updates](https://hermes.opensuse.org/feeds/62041.rdf) and[ openSUSE Maintenance  Security Updates](https://hermes.opensuse.org/feeds/62042.rdf).

Btw. the SUSE Linux Enterprise folks liked the @openSUSE_Update Twitter account so much that they setup a similar mechanism for SUSE Linux Enterprise updates, just follow [@SUSE_SLE_Update](http://twitter.com/SUSE_SLE_Update) on Twitter[![Follow SUSE_SLE_Update on Twitter](http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-a.png)](http://www.twitter.com/SUSE_SLE_Update).

Thanks to [Dirk](http://twitter.com/durikmel) for driving this and for [Klaas](http://twitter.com/dragotin) for his work on Hermes  that allowed this!


## openSUSE on Twitter


Speaking about twitter, there are a couple more openSUSE project accounts you might want to know:



	
  * **[@openSUSE](http://twitter.com/openSUSE)** - English speaking official openSUSE project Twitter

	
  * ** **[@openSUSE_DE](http://twitter.com/openSUSE_DE)- The German speaking openSUSE project Twitter

	
  * [@OBSHermes](http://twitter.com/OBSHermes) - a tweet for each checkin to the openSUSE:Factory development version


The @openSUSE account has a number of [lists](http://twitter.com/openSUSE/lists) with other twitter users from the openSUSE project that you can check for additional accounts. To be added to one of them, please send a DM to @openSUSE.

Happy Twittering,
