IP Exchange, a major german Internet Service Provider, is sponsoring the openSUSE project with internet connectivity.  They provide a mirror server in their location with a up to 1 GBit/s, a fast connection from the openSUSE Build Service and the central openSUSE ftp server to the mirror servers.

During the launch of openSUSE 10.3 we did already benefit from the sponsoring of IP Exchange. It allowed us to get the ISOs fast to the mirrors and to the people downloading 10.3.

We highly appreciate the contribution of IP Exchange and like to thank in the name of the openSUSE community. This makes the openSUSE project even more attractive to Linux contributors all over the world.
