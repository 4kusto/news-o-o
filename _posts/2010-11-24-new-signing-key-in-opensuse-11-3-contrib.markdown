The old openSUSE:11.3:Contrib signing key got deleted by an accident, so we have to generate the new one and sign all packages in this repo with it. It is safe to accept key with the following fingerprint when yast/zypper ask you to do so:

**4FC8 6B50 8808 B7D7 D36C  59E3 CC9C 2F60 7296 AFB2**

Sorry for the inconvenience!
