The openSUSE Project is bringing the green to Prague in April! The openSUSE Project will have a booth, demos, and several presentations at the LinuxExpo in Prague, April 15 and 16th at the Hotel Olympik Artemis.

LinuxExpo is billed as the largest exhibition and conference for Linux and FOSS in Central Europe. VIP entry to the Expo is CZK 1,300, or CZK 1,200 if you register on the Web site. Other prices apply to one day entry, or for passes that don't come with materials and lunch.


## Presentations


In addition to openSUSE demos at the booth, openSUSE contributors will be giving two presentations as part of the LinuxExpo Programme.

**Network Installation Fast and Simple:** Katarína Machálková and Michal Žugec will be demonstrating using the network installation, installing to network disks (iSCSI), and remote installation over SSH. The presentation will also cover automatic installations with AutoYaST.

**Making a Custom openSUSE Distro:** Michal Hrušecký and Marek Stopka will cover use of the openSUSE Build Service, creating your own packages, cooperation with packaging team members, and creation of custom distros using SUSE Studio.


## openSUSE Discs and Giveaways


We'll have openSUSE 11.1 DVDs available at the booth, as well as openSUSE t-shirts, stickers, and more.
