The [spicy power team](http://en.opensuse.org/POWER_Team) concentrated for openSUSE 10.3 on supporting the Sony Playstation PS3, the major changes are:



	
  * openSUSE 10.3 is fully installable with YaST on the Sony Playstation PS3

	
  * a kexec-based bootloader called [petitboot](http://ozlabs.org/~jk/projects/petitboot/) is used for PS3

	
  * There is a development pattern for Cell development on PS3 to easily install the needed packages


More details on installing openSUSE 10.3 on PS3 can be found at [http://en.opensuse.org/PS3](http://en.opensuse.org/PS3).

Besides the PS3, 10.3 also runs on the previously supported  Apple Power Mac, IBM POWER, and Pegasos PPC hardware for details see [http://en.opensuse.org/POWER@SUSE](http://en.opensuse.org/POWER%40SUSE).
