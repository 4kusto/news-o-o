![Tumbleweed-black]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Tumbleweed-black-300x127.png)Since the last update on [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) [Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed), there have been five snapshots and some of those snapshots have brought some interesting new packages.

The [20160225 snapshot](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-02/msg00672.html) allows [Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) users to add a package called '[discover](http://bit.ly/1QqNz8d)', which is the [KDE](https://www.kde.org/) software installer, implemented as an app store like application.

KDE users can zypper install [discover](http://bit.ly/1QqNz8d) to get the app store based on [AppStream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppStream).

Another package worth noting is the [OpenLDAP](http://www.openldap.org/) package that checks password strength and enforces password strength policies that will comply with IT needs. The feature comes in [snapshot 20160229](ttps://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-03/msg00011.html) as a ppolicy-check-module.

[Snapshot 20160226](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-02/msg00683.html) updated the [Linux Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/) to 4.4.2. That snapshot also added minor updates for YaST.

Among other packages updated in Tumbleweed this past week are [Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/) to version 38.6.0 in the [20160225 snapshot](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-02/msg00672.html) and [FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/) to 44.0.2 in the [20160229 snapshot](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-03/msg00011.html).

[Snapshot 20160228](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-02/msg00696.html) updated some python packages and snapshot [20160224](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-02/msg00643.html) updated [KDE Framework to 5.19.0](https://www.kde.org/info/kde-frameworks-5.19.0.php).

[Samba](https://www.samba.org/) and [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) both had updates this past week and [TreeLine](http://treeline.bellz.org/), which is used for managing, organizing and outlining, updated to 2.0.2.

Two more snapshots are expected to be released by the end of the week. [openQA](https://openqa.opensuse.org/) is not a blocking factor for Tumbleweed anymore and the amount of snapshots released shows how quickly testing of builds have improved.

[Libreoffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/) is currently building on the [Open Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/) and will take a few more hours to be built. Without any issues, it might be in one of the next two snapshots.

Tumbleweed users can plan on seeing [GNOME 3.20](https://wiki.gnome.org/ReleasePlanning/FeaturePlans) by end of the month or in early April if all goes expected to plan as the next major release of [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) is currently going through its release candidate process.
