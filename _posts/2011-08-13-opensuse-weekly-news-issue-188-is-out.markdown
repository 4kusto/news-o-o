      [Strategy DONE!](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/08/09/strategy-done/)
    

![](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4004/4356906718_7165a0b695_m.jpg)

Almost 2 years ago, at the first openSUSE conference, a discussion started about Strategy.
      A few months ago a final document was ready and on July 14th 2011, the strategy voting ended.
      Over 200 of the[openSUSE
      Members](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Members)Â voted, with 90% in favor of theÂ [current strategy document](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Strategy). What™s
      next?

**Looking back**

It™s been a long ride, and we™d like to give a short overview of the strategy discussion
      in the openSUSE community over the last 2 years.

**The beginning**

The strategy process was started after the first openSUSE conference, now almost 2 years
      ago. In that time, quite a number of people have participated in the strategy team: Michael
      Löffler, Joe Brockmeier, Kurt Garloff, Jan Weber, Pascal Bleser, Andreas Jaeger, Bryen
      Yunashko, Pavol Rusnak, Jos Poortvliet and Thomas Thym. Of course, many others contributed by
      commenting on the proposals via mailing plists, forums, blogs and other channels.

**Meetings**

Initially, the team met weekly and focused on learning about strategy and how to apply it
      to a community project like openSUSE. A competition analysis was done, as well as an
      assessment of strength and weaknesses and an overview of the challenges openSUSE is facing was
      made. In May 2010 a face to face meeting was held and the team came up with a community
      statement and three different ambitious and narrow high-level visions that we planned to
      evolve and combine later.These visions were then presented to the community and we hoped for
      new scenario™s to come from then.

**Change**

Where the team started out quite ambitiously, trying to define new niches and a clear
      direction, it became visible that the majority of the community lost interest along the way.
      In November 2010, the teamÂ had decided to do an u-turnÂ and



focus on describing who we are, as a community, instead of finding new ways to
        go.



The new goals where to:

  * Highlight the story behind openSUSE

  * Identify what users we target and illustrate what we offer to them,

  * Connect it with the issues that matter most to our community

**New tools and lots of input**

Much of the input given by community members throughout the process was looked at again
      and integrated in aÂ [first draft](https://news.opensuse.org/2010/09/16/opensuse_finding_target/)Â focusing onÂ the [target users of openSUSE](https://lite.co-ment.com/text/lNPCgzeGHdV/view/). With
      this draft, a new way of discussing the document was introduced:



[co-ment](http://www.co-ment.com/about/), a pretty awesome
          commenting tool under theÂ [GNU Affero GPL](http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/agpl-3.0.html)



Co-ment made it easy to give input on a specific sentence or word and discuss that in a
      structured manner, and a lot of input came in from the whole openSUSE community, withÂ [the second
        revision](https://news.opensuse.org/2010/09/27/opensuse-target-aquired/), introducingÂ what openSUSE offers its
        users, andÂ [the third](https://news.opensuse.org/2010/10/07/opensuse-strategy-the-third-and-fourth-part-of-the-trilogy/),Â what does openSUSEÂ **not**Â do, each drawing in almost 100 comments on co-ment alone. More
      responses were gathered and processed from various channels likeÂ [mailinglists](http://list.opensuse.org/),Â [the openSUSE forums](http://forums.opensuse.org/)andÂ [many other
      means](http://omgsuse.com/content/bertel-beat-thoughts-strategy).

TheÂ [last
        posting](https://news.opensuse.org/2010/10/15/finalizing-who-we-are/)Â before the openSUSE conference attempted to shorten the document. At the
      conference, the[strategy was presented](http://lwn.net/Articles/412025/)Â and
      discussed. ThisÂ [re-invigorated interest in the strategy](http://michal.hrusecky.net/2010/11/opensuse-conference-2010/)Â for some and a newÂ [team
        member](http://ungethym.blogspot.com/2010/10/opensuse-conference-2010-is-over.html)joined the strategy discussions. Based on the feedback at the conference the
      document gained some clarity as well as a short introduction.

On the 20th of December 2010, the strategy team sent the ˜final™ document to the openSUSE
      board to facilitate the member voting process.

**Finishing**

Due to the busy time before the openSUSE 11.4 release, it took a while for the board to go
      over the document. Some minor nitpicks arose and the new initiative Tumbleweed was added but
      after that the board asked Thomas Thym to start the voting. In the end, Jos Poortvliet put a
      vote on[connect](http://connect.opensuse.org/)Â as Thomas was not openSUSE
      Member yet and the team[announced
        the start of the voting](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/06/07/time-to-vote-on-the-opensuse-strategy/). Shortly before the 30th of June, the deadline was extended
      to have time for a mass-mailing to all openSUSE Members. It had turned out that quite a few
      hadn™t noticed the strategy voting yet and the Board wanted to give them a chance to provide
      their input as well.

**The results**

So on the 14th, the voting ended with a total of 204 votes, 90% of which were supportive
      of the strategy document (see table). As the voting page said, this support



does not mean that you have to fully agree or that it is exactly how you want it “ we
          are a diverse community with many opinions and individual goals. We can never all agree on
          anything, unless it is so completely vague it doesn™t mean anything. This document is the
          product of a compromise, but the team feels it does adequately describe who we are and
          where we want to go.



It does mean that the openSUSE Membership feels the document adequately describes the
      openSUSE community and what it does and doesn™t do.

Having the strategy document in place provides the project an anchor to reflect upon when
      project questions and issues arise, openSUSE Board Chairman Alan Clark said. It is a very
      good reference point for those either new to the project or those wanting to capture a glimpse
      of what openSUSE is and why one should come join us.

**openSUSE “ the world™s most flexible and powerful Linux
        distribution**

TheÂ [strategy](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Strategy)Â is a document
      which describes openSUSE as a community. Our values, goals and the way we work. It starts with
        theÂ [˜community
        statement™](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Strategy_Community_Statement):



We are the openSUSE Community “ a friendly, welcoming, vibrant, and active community.
          This includes developers, testers, writers, translators, usability experts, artists,
          promoters and everybody else who wishes to engage with the project.



And then summarizes what we do as follows:



The openSUSE project is a worldwide effort that promotes the use of Linux everywhere.
          The openSUSE community develops and maintains a packaging and distribution infrastructure
          which provides the foundation for the world™s most flexible and powerful Linux
          distribution. Our community works together in an open, transparent and friendly manner as
          part of the global Free and Open Source Software community.



After that, the strategy goes into more detail, talking about our target users, our
      philosophy when it comes to development, our focus on collaboration and the things we don™t
      do. While reading the strategy, you need to keep two things in mind: it is meant as an
      internal document “ it™s not marketing speak. And it™s not meant to tell anyone what to do or
      not to do “ we are an open community!

**The future**

The team noted that the



strategy is of course not set in stone for eternity although we probably won™t go
          through this process every year¦



and asked for further feedback in the mass mailing to the membership. Some comments did
      indeed come in, most notably asking for the ARM port and mobile devices as well as the impact
      of the openSUSE Foundation.

In the future, the strategy documents will surelyrequire some revision. Once somebody in
      the openSUSE community steps up to do an ARM port, which is likely to attract significant
      help, the document will have to be revisited to reflect this, just likeÂ [Tumbleweed](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Tumbleweed)Â resulted in a change.
      And once a openSUSE Foundation is established it is likely this new organisation will
      becomeÂ ˜owner™Â of this document. For such changes, theÂ `<[opensuse-strategy@opensuse.org](mailto:opensuse-strategy@opensuse.org)>`
      mailinglistÂ is still open and it will remain so. Obviously a discussion can also be held on
      the opensuse-project mailing list or in other places!

      [Christos Bountalis: A utility for merging configuration / sysconfig files “ Week 11
        Report](http://cbounta.wordpress.com/2011/08/09/a-utility-for-merging-configuration-sysconfig-files-“-week-11-report/)
    

A bit late this week™s report. But not without a reason, the last weeks i have been
      working hard in order to fulfill the initial goals of this project. After lot™s of coding /
      compiling / testing this week and of course mind storming i can now share with you very good
      and exciting news.

What is done this week:

  * aug_process_trees is finally done!! That means we can now proceed to the final goal
            that of implementing the merging functions.

  * moved whole code to Augeas version 0.9. Added necessary code and fixed already
            existing.

  * tree_get_children (fixed)

  * tree_compare_children (re worked)

  * tree_match_combine (added)

  * tree_match_lower_level(added)

  * tree_child_sort_label(fixed)

  * debug_print_treeArray(added)

  * debug_print_treeMatchArray(added)

What is to be done:

  * Finish Merging Functions

  * Create First Beta Packages

That is all in a few lines, as GSoC is getting closer to the end, the time available for
      completing the project is getting less. So I better get back to coding¦

[Marcus
        Hüwe: osc code cleanup - summary of week 11](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2011-08/msg00029.html)

Here's a small summary of the 11th (coding) week. This week I spent most of my time with
      working on the wc code.

DONE:

  * project wc: added commit and update methods

  * lots of wc code refactoring

TODO:

  * project wc: commit only specific files for a package instead of the complete package
            (the package wc class already supports this) (use case: osc ci pkg1/file pkg1/foo
            pkg2/bar pkg3)

  * convert old working copies to the new format

  * package wc: update: add support to specify stuff like "expand", "linkrev"
            etc.

  * project wc: add a revert method (to restore a package wc with state '!')

  * project/package wc: support diff

  * package wc: implement a pull method (does the same as "osc pull")

[Sebastian
        Oliva: JSON Weekly report](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2011-08/msg00032.html)

Hello, First of all, I'm sorry for the large delay on updating my previous report. 

I've spent most of the time improving the performance of the classes, adding multiple
      profiles support, and on styling the admin, profile and other pages. 

I have also done performance testing, having responses averaging 50ms/request response
      times on a testing server, with 200 concurrent requests. I expect higher performance on a
      deployment configuration. 

on the To Do List is: Creating at least an offline submitting client (either GTK or QT).
      Finishing the administrative pages configurations. Adding authentication on submitting
      profiles.





[Aditya
        Dani: Test Suite for btrfs - Weekly Update](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2011-08/msg00034.html)

This is a summary of the work that I did in the last week.(Week # 10) 

The test no. 256 was modified to add support for memory mapped i/o operations. Thus, now
      in the test the files are created using both direct i/o as well as memory mapped i/o. 

A new test, test no. 257 was added which handles large file creation and modification of
      upto 1GB. 

Both the tests 256 and 257 were modified to handle any snapshot supported generic file
      system. You can find the latest made changes [here](https://github.com/adityadani/xfstests/commits/).

[David John Williams: Entomologist UI Changes - Weekly Report #12](http://redache.wordpress.com/2011/08/12/entomologist-ui-changes-weekly-report-12/)

This week I™ve been working at getting Remember the Milk integration finished. Right now
      Lists can be added to Remember the Milk and I™m in the middle of implementing update/delete
      functionality. 

It has been a hard week as I™ve never had to use a web based API before and the Remember
      the Milk one doesn™t seem like the easiest to get to grips with (its beta form is probably
      indicative of this). The main time consumer now is getting the update/delete functionality
      which isn™t an issue with Remember The Milks API but one of trying to find the right solution
      that is generic enough to be used with other services so I avoid large chunks of code that are
      specific to a single service.

For the final week I will continue working on integrating Remember the Milk,Google
      Calendar and WebDAV and over the remaining 10 days I will try and get these services fully
      integrated. The final week of GSoC will hopefully be spent on preparing a 1.0 release and any
      code addition will be kept to a minimum (with a hope that there won™t be any outside of
      merging).

I wanted to open a fate feature about this when I first heard of plymouth, but
            reading
            http://fedoramagazine.wordpress.com/2008/10/21/interview-fedora-10s-better-startup/
            really makes me think we should go this way.

Ray's comment starting with "Every flicker and mode change in the boot
            process takes away from the whole experience." is especially interesting. Is it
            okay to track the "don't show grub by default" here?

            [1-click uninstall (Score: 162)](https://features.opensuse.org/305305)
          

An easy way to remove Software! For example: you installed an application with "1-click install" (which will install all the packages that you need), there should be an easy way (also with 1 click) to remove what you have installed with that 1-click operation... in another words: an "1-click Uninstall" to remove installed software (dependencies and packages included).

            [Update to GRUB v2 (Score: 145)](https://features.opensuse.org/308497)
          

Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn't
            going to go away. The code itself isn't well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It's only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don't have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

We need a feedback about packages that are preferred by users and actively used. Debian already has a tool named Popularity contest (popcon)

            [Package Installations should be chroot aware!](https://features.opensuse.org/312718)
          

Debian does this already! Prove if package installation or upgrade is done in a chroot. Rationale: Every time I refresh my openSUSE-Tumbleweed installation from a chroot I get this error:

Installing: filesystem-12.1-26.1 [error] Installation of filesystem-12.1-26.1 failed: (with --nodeps --force) Error: Subprocess failed. Error: RPM failed: error: unpacking of archive failed on file /proc: cpio: chown failed - Read-only file system

Of cause I bind mount /proc read only! In a chroot doing a mount of /proc is recommended for many purposes. For example an installation attempt of gentoo stage will fail without /proc mounted. As this /proc mounting is a standard procedure I prioritize this feature as mandatory ...

            [Provide i386 version of valgrind on amd64 hosts](https://features.opensuse.org/312723)
          

Current status:

            [Kmail Backup + Recover](https://features.opensuse.org/312725)
          

I would like to have a Backup-button (and Recover) for Kmail (and other programs).
It could easily copy all necesary data-files into a backup-folder.

Maybe selective backup (or selective recover) could be useful as some of the configurations are no longer desired.

Having Owncloud 2.0 support to:

> Create a self-hosted instance

> Template for easy web-hosted instance

> Upload files from dolphin etc

> Use docs/music/video/bookmarks from opensuse Apps

Would be awesome!

          August 21, 2011 from 0:00 to 23:59 UTC, The web page describing the event is [http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Open-Bugs-Day](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Open-Bugs-Day). The emphasis will be on finding
          what open bugs found in 11.4 are still present in 12.1 MS4. 

Although there are no Media that indicate they are MS4, it is possible to upgrade an
          MS3 installation to what is the equivalent of MS4. The procedure is to delete all existing
          repos and select the repos at 

  * [http://download.opensuse.org/factory/repo/oss](http://download.opensuse.org/factory/repo/oss)

  * [http://download.opensuse.org/factory/repo/non-oss](http://download.opensuse.org/factory/repo/non-oss)

  * [http://download.opensuse.org/factory/repo/debug](http://download.opensuse.org/factory/repo/debug)

Our next IRC meeting will be at 17:00 UTC, August 15 on Channel
          #opensuse-testing on the Freenode IRC Network. irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-testing. We
          will discuss our experiences with MS4 and finish the planning for Open Bugs Day. 

The last one is optional. Once these repos are selected (and enabled), then do 'sudo
          zypper dup'. Although the result announces itself as MS3, it really is MS4.

**Expected to be released in about two months, the next kernel version
        will offer optimised virtualisation, add bad block management components to the software
        RAID code and include an extended Nouveau driver for NVIDIA's Fermi graphics chips. Several
        developers have been criticised for their clumsy use of Git in this development
        cycle.**

Linus Torvalds has issued the first release candidate of Linux 3.1, closing the merge
      window of this version, whose final release is expected in late September or early October, 17
      days after theÂ release of Linux 3.0. Therefore, the first phase in the Linux development cycle
      was three days longer than usual. This was caused by the diving holiday Torvalds is currently
      taking in Hawaii; he is providing an impression of his tripÂ on Google Plus.

Kernel development has now entered the stabilising phase, which Torvalds and his
      co-developers mainly use to fix bugs; no further major changes are usually integrated in this
      phase, and the most important advancements of Linux 3.1 can therefore already be outlined. For
      instance, the code for software RAIDs will, on some RAID levels, be able to handle media that
      contain defective blocks. (...)

        [MakeUseOf/Yaara Lancet: Organize Your Research With The New Standalone Zotero](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/organize-research-standalone-zotero/)
      

Everyone in the world of research, and many people outside of it, knows that a good
        citation manager and [PDF organizer](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/3-pdf-document-management-tools-organizing-research/) is a must if you want to keep track of all the papers you™ve read
        and accumulated. For the past two years, I™ve been using Zotero to organize my research for
        articles. Zotero is a [Firefox](http://www.makeuseof.com/tags/firefox/) add-on in which you can save citations and links to [PDFs](http://www.makeuseof.com/tags/pdf/) and access them at any time.

One of Zotero™s biggest cons is that it works only within Firefox. This means you have
        to be running Firefox and use it to save the articles you find. As long as I was using
        Firefox, this was not a big issue, but when I switched to [Chrome](http://www.makeuseof.com/tags/chrome/) for a while, it became quite
        cumbersome. Not to speak of the fact that I had to load Firefox every time I wanted to look
        at my database (which can be a lengthy process at times).

This is why I was delighted to find out that Zotero have come up with Standalone Zotero
        Alpha (Windows, Mac and Linux) and with Chrome and Safari connectors for it. Note that this
        project is still in alpha, so it is not perfect by any means. These new versions came out in
        February, so hopefully we™ll see some updates soon. Now let™s see what it can do to organize
        your research. (...)

Sometimes, especially on the command line, it happens that you delete a file or
        directory you didn't really plan to delete. A second after hit enter you realize what you
        have done, maybe you are fast enough to stop the deletion process and save some files, but
        in the most cases it's already to late, at least for some files. If you have no or a too
        old backup you're screwed.

If you use ext3/ext4 you may be able to recover the file with [ext3grep](http://code.google.com/p/ext3grep/) or[extundelete](http://extundelete.sourceforge.net/) with information from the
        file system journal if the content of the file wasn't already overwritten by new

With KDE 4.7, the KDE team has managed to create one of the most beautiful desktops out there, and to be honest, it™s even more appealing than Windows 7 or Mac OS X. On the usability front, KDE doesn™t seem to cut corners. Trademark features like Activities and Plasmoids (widgets) are polished to near perfection. Also, since the initial KDE 4 release, a lot of quality community-created widgets and plugins have sprung up, making the KDE workspace more than just an alternative to GNOME 3 or Unity. So, if you™ve just installed KDE on your computer, here are some of the best widgets you can drop on to your desktop and make your friends jealous. (...)

Hi - my name is Matthew, and I am a copy-and-paste addict.

I have tried over the years to find open source alternatives, but nothing has come close.

One script that I did [come across recently](http://askubuntu.com/questions/55626/right-click-copy-contents-of-file-to-clipboard) allows you to copy the contents of files selected in the Nautilus Gnome file browser to the clipboard. This is great for copying things like code snippets and customized email signatures for those applications that don't natively offer that functionality. (...)

        [Linux Journal/Bruce Byfield: Printing in Scribus](http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/printing-scribus)
      

Scribus is designed for quality printing. Unlike a word processor, its output is not meant simply to be good enough for practical use, but to be fine-tuned until it is as close as possible to what you want. For this reason, printing is considerably more complicated in Scribus than in the office applications with which you may be familiar.

Fortunately, Scribus usually chooses defaults that fit most cases. It also provides rollover help that advises you on whether you need a setting -- although, depending on your version of Scribus, some settings may not be included in this help.

Still, once you know the work-flow, printing in Scribus is relatively straight-forward. Many of the options are either specifically for professional-quality printing, or for fixing specific problems. Taking the time to familiarize yourself with the options, gives you the chance to come closer to the perfectionism that is impossible in office applications. (...)

          Gladys leaps over to the tape deck, presses levers and switches. Sound of tape reversing. There is a hum and lights flash on and off. A blurred image of a lady in the street comes up on one of the monitors.
        ](http://www.ibras.dk/montypython/episode33.htm#4)

In this tutorial we look at using images in a GUI environment. One of the possible
        attributes which can be assigned to a Label or Button widget is an image. You will surely
        have seen many buttons with images on them.  Every time you see a toolbar in a program,
        each of the images on it is itself on a button widget. In order to do this tutorial though
        there are a couple of issues:

  * first, you need to have images in the Python4kids directory we set up several
              tutorials ago. You also need to start Python from within that directory.

  * second, unless you install something called the Python Imaging Library (PIL),
              Python can only handle a few limited types of image file. One of the file types which
              will work is .gif, which we will be using here. This tutorial**will not work** with jpeg files.

[Nagios](http://olex.openlogic.com/packages/nagios) is a great application for monitoring your systems, allowing you to set alert levels and trip actions when those levels are reached. The software uses a plugin-based structure; even the most simple functions (such as check_ssh and check_disk) are plugins. This makes Nagios incredibly flexible; if there™s something you want to monitor, and you can think of a way to write it, you can write a plugin, hook it into Nagios, and start running it. But even better than that: for most things you might want to monitor, someone has already done written the plugin for you. (...)

[Sebastian Kügler:
        Desktop Summit Thoughts](http://vizzzion.org/blog/2011/08/desktop-summit-thoughts/)

I™ve been to theÂ [Desktop Summit](http://desktopsummit.org/)Â in Berlin
      for the past few days, we™re now around the middle of the event, after the conference, before
      the workshop and BoF sessions, so I thought I might share some thoughts I™ve gathered in idle
      moments in the past few days.

**boredom and diversity**

Last night, the build system BoF was planned, a team session where we look at the way how
      we develop our software. I have to admit that to me, this is quite a boring (but nevertheless
      very important topic). As it also affects the way we release software, I™ve put my release
      team hat on and joined the session. I was a bit afraid that since it™s not the most sexy topic
      in the world, that little people would show and we end up with incomplete or broken ways to
      release the KDE SC, and KDE Frameworks in the future. My worries were ungrounded as quite some
      people showed up and we made good progress on all the topic we talked about. (If you™re
      interested what we talked about, keep an eye on the kde-core-devel and kde-buildsystem
      mailinglists.) What struck me is that in KDE, there™s enough people who feel responsible, even
      for boring topics. When I shared my (ungrounded) concerns with Stephen Kelly, he looked at me
      with this empty expression on his face and told me but that™s exciting, it™s the way we build
      our software!, and given his enthusiasm, I believe him (even if I don™t exactly personally
      share his excitement). Diversity makes us strong. (...)

[Matthias Hopf: SUSE graphical
        benchmark test](http://emmes.livejournal.com/9967.html)

We at SUSE needed to know whether we had some severe regressions regarding graphics
      performance during enablement of intel SandyBridge graphics - and it turned out that it was
      not commonly understood what graphics performance is
      actually composed of. Some were only interested in core X commands (xterm users :-) , some
      only in render performance (office users :-) , some in low-core 3D graphics (compiz users :-)
      , some in hardcore 3D graphics (gamers :-) .

So finally I put together a standardized graphical benchmark with aspects for all users.
      And no, it won't output a single number, because that would be meaningless for everybody. But
      it makes it easy to compare different aspects between different graphics cards and drivers,
      and there are some surprising results. But more about the results later.

The sources for the benchmark are now on gitorious, and the [Wiki
        entry](https://gitorious.org/performance-frameworks/pages/GraphicalBenchmark) describes its usage. It's currently somewhat tailored to SLE11SP1, so you
      might run into minor issues when running it on a different OS version. And of course, it's not
      very polished yet .

[Holger Hetterich: SMB Traffic Analyzer @ openSUSE conference](http://holger123.wordpress.com/2011/08/11/smb-traffic-analyzer-opensuse-conference/)

Should you read this article in a blog roll, here is a clue what it is about: a) the
        [SMB Traffic Analyzer
        project (SMBTA)](http://holger123.wordpress.com/smb-traffic-analyzer/), b) [the openSUSE
        conference](http://conference.opensuse.org/), and c) [Samba](http://holger123.wordpress.com/2011/08/11/smb-traffic-analyzer-opensuse-conference/www.samba.org).

You guess it, we finally got a slot for a presentation at the wonderful [openSUSE conference](http://conference.opensuse.org/) for [SMBTA](http://holger123.wordpress.com/smb-traffic-analyzer/). To me, it is
      remarkable to see a project like SMBTA being presented at OSC because it is not really
      something related to openSUSE. It™s not that SMBTA improves your boot time, or discusses
      details of the [buildservice](https://build.opensuse.org/), or makes your
      life with the openSUSE distribution better in any way. SMBTA is very likely not even
      interesting to the casual user, except for some administrators.

That said, SMBTA was born inside of the openSUSE infrastructure, growing to a project used
      on different distributions and operating systems, such as Solaris. And the one thing we can
      really say is that we exploited all the services that make up openSUSE to the core. We used
      the openSUSE Buildservice from the beginning, and we use appliances created by [SUSE Studio](http://susestudio.com/) for both demoing and developing
      SMBTA.

With the recent release of [Samba 3.6.0, among it™s top
        changes like full SMB2 support and other major features](http://www.samba.org/samba/news/releases/3.6.0.html), it is also prime time for
      SMBTA. The** Virtual File System layer** module that supports our
      current infrastructure is included in this release of the Samba CIFS server and that marks
        **a milestone** for our project. SMBTA is already used in
      production at some sites, and the release of Samba 3.6.0 will hopefully forward this
      trend.

Benjamin Brunner and me will give an introduction talk to SMB Traffic Analyzer at the
      openSUSE conference and most likely **live-demo** the software
      chain. We™ll welcome anyone interested to join our presentation at OSC!

[Sebastian Kügler: Board
        Business](http://vizzzion.org/blog/2011/08/board-business/)

Tonight, the new board of directors of KDE e.V. went out for dinner, generously (!)
      treated by our constituency. 

It was a nice and relaxed dinner, gave us some good opportunity to brief Lydia (our newest
      board member) on how we work, boring stuff like where we store our documents, what to expect
      from our bi-weekly conference calls, what granularity of emailing we found to be productive,
      and so on. One official thing we always have to do (according to German foundation
      regulations, so-called Vereinsrecht) is appointing roles. Cornelius was volunteered as
      president, Frank as treasurer, both accepted their new and old responsibilities. I promoted
      from regular board member to vice president (which really only has a a theoretical meaning).
      The vote was, as usual a formal thing and we got it done between dumpling 2 and 3 on my plate,
      it took all of 3 minutes. Serious, effective, yet duely diligent. :P 

We also used the opportunity to talk about non-board stuff, about our other projects in
      KDE (we™re also pretty active in the community outside of the board chores), private going
      ons, random fun things. I came back happy about our team, and looking forward to our work in
      the coming year. Just right. 

Earlier this afternoon, we met with the GNOME board. There were also some personal changes
      in the new GNOME board, I especially enjoyed Ryan Lortie (desrt) having joined the board of
      directors of the GNOME foundation. I™ve met Ryan at several occasions in the past, and always
      found that we got a good click, enough differences to keep conversations interesting, but very
      much one the same line of communication. One of the topics was communications across the
      boards, and we thought that having some kind of ˜open communication channel™ for situtations
      which might turn unproductive would be good. Ryan and me volunteered, and we took immediate
      opportunity and went out for an afternoon drink, which I very much enjoyed. 

While going to our dinner appointment, I had really two things in mind, love and hate. Not
      sure why those two words sprang to my mind, but I really hate saying goodbye to the people I love.
      Even if it™s very much a temporary thing (our meetings in the Plasma team have become pretty
      frequent, especially with Plasma Active One being on the horizon), having people leave after
      an intensive week of excellent collaboration always makes me kind of sad. That™s of course
      just an indication of how much I enjoy working in this excellent team, or maybe just a sign of
      exhaustion after a week of pushing the Free desktop to the next level with peers who are as
      passionate about this as I am. Tomorrow in the afternoon, I™ll take a train back home to the
      Netherlands, and will commence putting our plans (and continuation, tweaks thereof) to action.
      Exhausted after week of frantic Free software conferencing, but just as energized as if it
      were my first Akademy.

The coming weekend will be used for catching up on sleep, then next weekend, I™ll be at
        [Froscon](http://froscon.de), where I™ll be presenting Plasma Active. Be
      there if you want to touch it yourself. :)

### Announcements




        [Samba Team Releases Version 3.6](http://www.samba.org/samba/news/releases/3.6.0.html)
      

The Samba Team is proud to announce the release of Samba 3.6, a major new release of the award-winning Free Software file, print and authentication server suite for Microsoft WindowsÂ® clients.

**The First Free Software SMB2 Server**

Samba 3.6 includes the first Free Software implementation of Microsoft's new SMB2 file serving protocol. SMB2 within Samba is implemented with a brand new asynchronous server architecture, allowing Samba to display the performance enhancements SMB2 brings to Microsoft networking technology.

Samba's new SMB2 server has been tested by major vendors and has been able to double the performance of some network applications when run in conjunction with Microsoft Windows 7Â® clients. (...)

The KDE desktop is about to take a major step forward, with the announcement today of
        the roadmap for KDE Frameworks 5.0.

Most eyes in the Linux desktop world are on the Berlin Desktop Summit this week, as
        members of the GNOME and KDE camps come together for a joint technical conference running
        from August 6-12 at Humboldt University in Berlin. Currently, KDE seems to be making the
        most strides in the joint event, with the surprise announcement of the KDE 5.0 roadmap,
        which was revealed by KDE developer Aaron Seigo in his blog Sunday.

According to Seigo, the new KDE Frameworks roadmap, which will encompass "the next major
        release of KDE's libraries and runtime requirements," will have an "emphasis... on
        modularity, dependency clarity/simplification and increasing quality to the next level."

        [Wazi/Brian Proffitt: LibreOffice vs. OpenOffice.org: Showdown for Best Open Source Office Suite](http://olex.openlogic.com/wazi/2011/libreoffice-vs-openoffice-org-showdown-for-best-open-source-office-suite/)
      

With the release of a new version ofÂ [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/)Â this month, it™s a good time to look at the two major open source
        office suites, LibreOffice and[OpenOffice.org](http://olex.openlogic.com/packages/openoffice), to see what advantages each offers, and which is a better bet for
        end users.

Both products are suites of office applications, comprising word process, spreadsheet,
        presentation graphics, database, drawing, and math tools. Both also spring from the same
        code base. OpenOffice.org was created by a German company called Star Division, which Sun
        Microsystems bought in 1999. Originally the suite was called StarOffice, and it was popular
        in the European market as an alternative to Microsoft Office. After picking it up, Sun
        changed the name of the product to OpenOffice.org and released its code as open source. The
        product retained some popularity in the enterprise, partly because of its cross-platform
        capabilities and no-cost license.

In 2009, Oracle announced it would be acquiring Sun, and many wondered what would become
        of OpenOffice.org. When Oracle proved to be less than willing to share its plans for the
        product, a number of[OpenOffice.org community members opted to fork the OpenOffice.org code](http://listarchives.documentfoundation.org/www/announce/msg00000.html). In November 2010, they
        created LibreOffice, to be managed by a new German non-profit calledÂ [The Document Foundation](http://www.documentfoundation.org/).

A few months later,Â [Oracle opted to donate the OpenOffice.org project to the Apache Software Foundation](http://lwn.net/Articles/446093/), which today
        maintains OpenOffice.org as a so-called podling project until OpenOffice.org completes the
        migration process to become fully integrated within the Apache organization. (...)

        [Charles E. Craig, Jr.: What is the difference between GNOME, KDE, Xfce, and LXDE?](http://www.renewablepcs.com/about-linux/kde-gnome-or-xfce)
      

In Linux, there are so many choices, and this includes the desktop environments and window managers. Four of the most popular [desktop environments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment) in Linux are [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/), [KDE](http://www.kde.org/), [Xfce](http://www.xfce.org/), and [LXDE](http://lxde.org/). All four offer sophisticated point-and-click [graphical user interfaces (GUI)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) which are on par with the desktop environments found in [Windows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows) and [Mac OS X](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_osx). When you ask different people which of these four is best, you will likely get many different answers. So which is the best between GNOME, KDE, Xfce, and LXDE? Well..... it is largely a matter of opinion, and the capabilities of your computer hardware can also be important in deciding. For example, users with older computers will be better served to choose Xfce or especially LXDE, while users with newer hardware can get more desktop effects by choosing GNOME or KDE. My recommendation would be to try all four of these desktop environments and decide for yourself which one works best for you. GNOME, KDE, Xfce, and LXDE are all excellent and to varying degrees each can be customized in a number of ways. My personal favorite is GNOME 2.x which is slowly being replaced by GNOME 3, though (very fortunately) GNOME 2.x is still being kept alive in [Linux Mint](http://www.linuxmint.com/), [Debian](http://www.debian.org/), and some other distros. Of the most recent desktop environments, my favorite is the newly-released Xfce 4.8. (...)

Most people think of open source projects having the following features in common:

  * Source Code Access

  * Process to Submit Code Changes

  * Process to Submit Bugs

  * Documentation (at varying levels of quality)

  * Ownership of Project Trademark

  * Public Release Schedule

Of course, there may be other items that are commonly considered features, however, I want to focus on the second bullet; Process to Submit Code Changes. If an open source project has all of the above features except doesn™t accept code changes, is it no longer an open source project? (...)

There™s a lot to like about open source software. It can help your business by cutting costs and producing better software. It™s open, auditable, and customizable, and free of the restrictive, invasive licenses and EULAs that infest proprietary software. You can build a community around an open source project, one that incorporates contributions from both staff and outside developers.

### Warning!




        [the telegraph: 10-year-old girl hacker discovers smartphone security flaw](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/8691096/10-year-old-girl-hacker-discovers-smartphone-security-flaw.html)
      

A 10-year-old girl has uncovered a security flaw in popular Android and iOS games after
      becoming bored at their slow pace.

FigureÂ 1.Â Farmville is similar to the type of game vulnerable to the attack

![Farmville is similar to the type of game vulnerable to the attack](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01825/farmvilleweb_1825823c.jpg)

  


The young hacker, whose real name has not been disclosed, presented her findings at the
        Defcon conference in Las Vegas as part of a competition to find the next generation of
        computer security experts.

Going by the hacker name CyFi, she found that she could manually advance the clock in
        unnamed games to avoid waiting for virtual crops to grow. Independent researchers have
        confirmed the vulnerability.

She**
           [told CNET](http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-20089152-12/10-year-old-hacker-finds-zero-day-flaw-in-games/)
        **: It was hard to make progress in the game, because it
        took so long for things to grow. So I thought, 'Why don't I just change the time?™

CyFi™s hack also involved circumventing measures within the games designed to catch such
        cheating. She found that disconnecting the device from WiFi and advancing the clock in small
        increments avoided detection.

It has not been revealed how much control the technique grants an attacker over a device
        or which games are vulnerable, to allow developers to patch the security flaw.
