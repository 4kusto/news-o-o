_Heya all,_

In less than 3 weeks, our little baby, openSUSE 12.1, will be released into the wild. Now as you know, babies need **lots** of attention! This is where we need _YOU_.

openSUSE 12.1 needs to be promoted **everywhere**! That is, on _your_ blog; on twitter, facebook, Google plus; and much more! Read on for details and tips on how **you can help us** spread the word!<!-- more -->

### backgrounds for your computer, (micro)blog and more


We've got a few nice backgrounds for you to be used on your (micro)blog or your desktop!

[Richard "Ilmehtar" Brown](https://twitter.com/#!/sysrich) has created a very cool openSUSE 12.1 Twitter background. You can add it to your blog in two ways.

**The generic Twitter background**
First, you can add one of the generic Twitter backgrounds. Pick one from [here](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Buttons_and_banners#Sidebars_for_Twitter).
Then, go through the following steps:



	
  1. Login in your account of Twitter

	
  2. Select _Settings_ in the top panel

	
  3. In Design tab, select _Change background image_

	
  4. Select the image

	
  5. Click on _Save changes_


**A cool, customized Twitter background!**
To get your own, custom background like Richard has, download the svg file [here](http://en.opensuse.org/File:OS_SB_openSUSE12.1_custom_by_Richard.svg) and customize it with Inkscape. Find a how-to [on the wiki](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Buttons_and_banners#How_to_customize_the_svg_files).

A bonus tip from _Ilmehtar_ himself:


<blockquote>For an extra tweak of polish, after you set that image as your background in twitter, you can also change your background colour to 436400 (twitter lets you type that number in)..which'll mean that on very high resolutions the background will gently blend into the right colour ;-)</blockquote>

### Widgets, counters and banners for your blog or website




#### Release Counter


You can add the openSUSE 12.1 release counter to your website in various sizes by including the following html code in your blog:
`<a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:12.1"><img src="http://counter.opensuse.org/**medium**.png" border="0"/></a><br/>`
"medium" is the size of the counter; it can also be "small" or "large" and we also have "wide" for a banner.

See [the Countdown page on the openSUSE Wiki](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Countdown) for more countdown information, code and tips!

## Other ways of helping


_If you want to know the latest stuff about openSUSE promotion_ sign up to the [ambassador mailinglist](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-ambassadors).

Helping out is also greatly appreciated. For openSUSE 12.1 we have the [Launch Checklist](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Launch_Checklist) which has a list of tasks... If there is stuff you want to/can help with, let us know on the [openSUSE marketing mailing list](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-marketing)! There's lots of writing to be done, like articles about the great new _GNOME 3.2_, the polish done on _XFCE_ and _LXDE_, and what's better about KDE's latest _desktop and netbook_ offerings.

But we can also use some more technical writing help. We'll review and edit the articles for English language, what we need is the content... Many of your marketing friends are not so technical!


## But most importantly...


... you should **have a lot of fun!**
