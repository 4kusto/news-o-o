[openSUSE Summer Camp Greece 2011](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/06/20/opensuse-summer-camp-greece-2011/)

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Geekocamp.jpg)

Summer in Greece! Is the weather too hot for you to code or contribute to your favorite
      FOSS project? Do you need some motivation and a refreshing swim? Come to our Summer
      Camp!

The Greek openSUSE community is organizing its first openSUSE Summer Camp, in central
      Greece at Grand Platon Hotel at Olympiaki akti. This is is the beach of the city of Katerini.
      The doors will be open from the 15th to the 17th of July 2011, at the Heart of Summer!

**Sounds awesome, I™ll book my tickets.**

So, you™ll be there. What can you expect?

Our goal is to bring FOSS communities closer and encourage people to contribute to their
      favorite projects.

A lot of people, with little to a lot of experience can benefit from the workshops
      included in our program, during which we will work on things like translation, wiki usage,
      coding, packaging and much more, showing how to work inside a community and how to collaborate
      with others!

**Hmmm. But I could go swimming¦**

There will be relaxing and swimming of course! But hey, we have a common passion, don™t
      we?

We love what we do, we are having fun contributing to FOSS and we hate doing it alone in
      our rooms during Summer time. Besides coding, translating and all other ˜working stuff™ there
      will also be plenty of sun and beach, a large swimming pool and plenty of beers “ all paid by
      you since we only sponsor the sun, the fun and all the other free stuff¦

We are looking forward to seeing you at the openSUSE Summer Camp Greece!

[openSUSE
        releases milestone 2](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/06/22/opensuse-releases-milestone-2/)

![](http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/geeko-cast-my-vote.png)

About 3 weeks after the [first
        milestone for openSUSE 12.1](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/06/01/first-step-towards-12-1-with-milestone-1/), today the second milestone has been made available.
      Following the [Roadmap](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Roadmap), this is
      the second of 6 milestone until the openSUSE 12.1 release in November.

**Milestones**

openSUSE is developed in a repository called [Factory](http://opensuse.org/Portal:Factory). Packages flow from the [devel projects](http://nl.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_Collaboration#Devel_Project_maintainer.27s_workflow) into Factory upon OK from the [release team](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Release_team) following the [Factory Development
        Model](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Factory_development_model). During the [development
        cycle](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Roadmap) ([more detailed
        model](http://www.suse.de/%7Ecoolo/opensuse_12.1/)) periodic releases are made available for testing “ these are the milestones.
      Six of them become available. After some several freezes go into effect, the component freeze
      just before the fourth milestone for instance. And about a couple of weeks after the last
      milestone the first of two Release Candidates is made ready for testing. The final openSUSE
      12.1 release is expected on November 11th.

**Progress since the previous milestone**

The first milestone had a huge number of changes and improvements on top of the latest
      openSUSE release. Again, many packages have been updated. You can check the latest package
      versions on [this page](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Factory_versions).
      What are the major changes?

  * Firefox 5 RC

  * Horde4 packages (php5-pear-horde)

  * The Board

  * rawstudio

  * llvm/clang 3.0 snapshot

  * many smaller updates to KDE and GNOME applications and desktops

Also nspluginwrapper is now updated which will allow a more stable Flash plugin on 64bit
      platforms. With this change you can now watch two flash videos at the same time. And over 100
      new packages have been added, including extensions for Banshee, some small tools like [DDS2tar](http://software.opensuse.org/search?q=dds2tar) and [brainfuck interpreter](http://brainfuck.tk/), Cdecl (turns C/C++ gibberish into
      English), cint (small C/C++ interpreter) and a number of other devel and language
      tools.

**systemd**

On the openSUSE [project](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/)
      and [factory](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/) mailing lists a
      discussion is taking place centered around the new systemd init system. After [the introduction of
        the road to systemd for openSUSE 12.1](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2011-06/msg00210.html) by [Frederic
        Crozat](http://blog.crozat.net/2011/06/road-to-systemd-for-opensuse-121.html), issues, complaints and limitations of systemd are being discussed and
      dissected. Changing an init system is an invasive change and systemd has ambitions beyond just
      replacing sysV not everyone always agrees with. Work will be needed to ensure a stable and
      usable init system for 12.1 and the team welcomes help and bugreports!

**Helping out easier than ever!**

As expected from a development release, there is still a lot of work to do, so your input
      at this early stage will be a huge help in making the final release into the beautifully
      polished work that we aim for. openSUSE 12.1 Milestone 2 has a [list of most annoying bugs
        here](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Most_annoying_bugs_12.1_dev), please add issues you find and help fix them. As Will Stephenson [recently
        blogged](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/05/16/have-you-burped-yet-today/), fixing an issue is a matter of **BURP**ing on
        [build.opensuse.org](http://build.opensuse.org)! Find a how-to [here](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_Collaboration#Example_with_web_interface).

So go and see for yourself what the next version of openSUSE has in store for you at our
        [download center](http://software.opensuse.org/developer).

[Ratan Sebastian: GSOC 2011: ssc - Week
        4](http://rxvl.in/post/6688635893)

The DirectoryManager module has been polished and it now handles duplicate entries in the
      software and repositories files. The app now handles errors better and crashes more gracefully
      with meaningful error messages. As for functionality, I™ve added package banning and
      unbanning. Also package importing has been included in the current release.

I™ve started work on the file handling of the app. Currently it works similar to the
      packages or repositories with the difference that the file in question is copied over to
      <appliance_directory>/files. Adding and removing these files will be simple enough
      within the current framework. And with some work time-stamp information can be incorporated to
      do more efficient syncs. I hope to have that done by next week and follow up with a basic
      implementation of the commit command in the week after that so that we can have a first usable
      version of the client.

If you want to check out the application now, you can take it for a spin using [the gem](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/546252/ssc_releases/ssc-0.1.0.gem). Use with
      caution, and all that. It shouldn™t do anything catastrophic, but, I wouldn™t use it with
      anything other than a test appliance at this point. Download it from [here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/546252/ssc_releases/ssc-0.1.0.gem). Install it
      with [rubygems](http://rubygems.org) (gem install ssc-0.1.0.gem) and run ssc
      help to see the usage instructions.

      [Marcus Hüwe: [gsoc] osc code cleanup “ summary of week 4](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/06/19/gsoc-osc-code-cleanup-summary-of-week-4/)

here™s a small summary of the 4th (coding) week. I spent most of the time with writing the
      RemoteFile classes and the BuildResult class (+ testcases of course:) ).

TODO for this week:

  * improve RemoteFile classes

  * add APIInfo class:

- resolve url-like parameters (api://foo/bar repo/arch)

- raise an exception if required parameters are missing

- initialize optional parameters with the config default

- encapsulate context-sensitivity logic (sometimes parameters should be read from
          the working copy (like apiurl, project or package))

We updated all openSUSE 11.4 public AMIs on Amazon EC2! (All built with SUSE Studio.) If
        you are using 11.4 on EC2 we highly recommend switching to those updated AMIs. We ran into

          [OBS 2.3 Beta 2](http://lists.opensuse.org/archive/opensuse-buildservice/2011-06/msg00134.html)
        

This OBS 2.3 release is now feature complete. We changed a bit more then expected:

  * New source service mode handling is default now. Server side services get
                applied when listing in expand mode, like with source links.

  * Configuration UI to setup OBS instance name and description.

  * MeeGo.com is pre-configured now.

  * backend daemons have integrated runtime management

  * A large number of bugfixes

**Current State**

Open tasks for next weeks are:

  * Get documentation in a better shape so that we can switch openSUSE maintenance
                using the new mechanisms.

  * There are absolute zero known regressions known atm. So really everything should
                be at least as good as in OBS 2.1.x :) Feel free to run it on your production
                system, we do it also on build.opensuse.org :)

**The call for help**

There are still a number of areas where some clean up is needed. For example we have

  * 20 FIXME2.2 lines in the code (means that read access handling code needs
                checking)

  * 10 FIXME2.3 lines in the code (maintenance code needs a revisit here)

  * Unknown state of Cross architecture builds. It would be nice if someone can help
                so that the OBS Appliance can build for arm architectures out of the box.

You can stop here when you read already Beta 1 announcement ,)

**OBS 2.3 main features**

The main features of this release are 

  * Full distribution maintenance support. This includes support for the workflow in
                OBS and also the patch channel generation. This functionality can be used at full
                glance with coordination and review teams or just in parts.

  * Read access protection for projects (as planned for OBS 2.2)

Apart from that we have many smaller improvements, esp. in the area of request
          handling and the webui integration.

**Download it**

As usual, you find current packages or an appliance in openSUSE:Tools:Unstable
          project. OBS 2.3 Beta 2 is tagged as version 2.2.84. 

Please read here for usage details for the appliance:[http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_Appliance](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_Appliance) (...)

          [Nelson Marques: GNOME3 and openSUSE 12.1 “ A conspiracy theory!](http://www.marques.so/2011/06/conspiracy-theories-and-gnome2/)
        

This text is based on a personal interpretation of several events, and as such it
          reflects one of several potential interpretations, MINE!

On the last [GNOME Team](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GNOME_team)[meeting](http://community.opensuse.org/meetings/opensuse-gnome/2011/opensuse-gnome.2011-06-16-15.32.html) there was a small topic to check if it would be interesting to have a
          GNOME2 spin for the upcoming 12.1 release of [openSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org). It was decided not to provide a GNOME2 spin and somehow this suggests
          that GNOME2 is dead for openSUSE (unless someone takes the job in).

One of the interesting things that poped during this meeting was the fact that [GNOME3](http://www.gnome3.org) has a ˜fallback mode™, or at least that™s how
          it became to be knownÃ½amongÃ½GNOME users, press and competitors. It™s not really hard to
          understand that ˜fallback™ became a connotative form that throws in a lot of negative
          energy, much in the way that it seems to be an unwanted ˜feature™.

I believe that [Vincent Untz](http://en.opensuse.org/User:Vuntz)
          proposed a very interesting plan regarding this GNOME3 vs GNOME2³ possibilities: provide
          an alternative Desktop option where the feature known as ˜fallback mode™ can be presented
          as an attractive option to the standard GNOME Shell for users who seek ˜classic™ looks.
          It™s somehow unclear to me how we will achieve this, but I™m sure that a few ideas might
          have been already on the forge for testing.

The [Fedora Project](http://www.fedoraproject.org) has taken a
          different approach and it seems that [GNOME2 is making it™s way into Fedora 15](http://ostatic.com/blog/how-would-you-like-gnome-2-32-on-fedora-15), the most controversial release of the Fedora
          Project, nevertheless one of their greatest, maybe only surpassed by Fedora 13. This
          initiative is called ˜BlueBubble™ and lead by Fedora Ambassador and Packager [Juan Moreno](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Nushio), to whom I wish all
          the success with his work, as I™m sure that many Fedora users will be thrilled with such
          option available.

Back into the openSUSE world I also recognize a huge amount of value, and though it
          might become a complicate task to strike down the current idea people have about the
          ˜fallback mode™ (clearly a huge failure from whoever decided to call it ˜fallback mode™)
          and try to make it a more useful feature towards the classic GNOME2 Desktop, thus
          promoting among our users that upgrading to GNOME3 is the way! With openSUSE there won™t
          be a 10th year for GNOME2 life cycle! The future lies only with GNOME3 which has shown
          great potential and stability on it™s initial release, specially if we compare it to the
          initial release of it™s main competitors, [KDE4](http://www.kde.org) and
            [Unity](http://launchpad.net/unity).

openSUSE and GNOME3 lead the way now!

          [Sebastian Kügler: Plasma Active Updates](http://vizzzion.org/blog/2011/06/plasma-active-updates/)
        

**Plasma Active Updates**

During the past weeks, we™ve been kind of silent around Plasma Active. This doesn™t
          mean we™ve just been sitting on our lazy bums, but that we™ve poured a lot of work into
          various aspects of the Plasma Active user experience. Let me details these changes to give
          you some idea of where we are. But first off, ¦

**What is Plasma Active?**

Plasma Active is a KDE project building a touch-friendly user experience for the
          device spectrum. You can compare it to the KDE Software Compilation, Plasma Active
          provides a workspace and applications. The first focused target devices are tablets, such
          as the ExoPC, also known as WeTab. Plasma Active builds on top of KDE frameworks such as
          the Plasma libraries and the Nepomuk Semantic Desktop, offering a touch-friendly interface
          taylored to use-cases of the specific device. Components of Plasma Active are re-usable
          across different devices, bringing many well-known apps to new devices. The user interface
          used on a specific device can differ across devices, making sure it fits the devices
          characteristics and use-cases.

**How is Plasma Active developed?**

Plasma Active is fully community-developed and builds on existing KDE frameworks.
          Re-using technologies such as Plasma, we already have quite some usefl apps to run on
          Plasma Active, more apps are relatively easy to write or to port to Plasma Active. (I™ll
          explain more about this in a later blog.) One very nice thing is that Plasma Active by
          design is ultimately hackable, it uses components that many people know already, many
          aspects of the system can even be directly changed on the device by opening it™s QML files
          with the description of the user interfaces.

Plasma Active™s development happens in KDE™s Git infrastructure, communication can be
          followed on the active@kde.org mailinglist, our IRC channel (#active on irc.freenode.net)
          is welcoming and open for everyone. This doesn™t mean that there™s no commercial
          investment in Plasma Active, or that it™s impossible to participate in Plasma Active as a
          commercially interested partner, it™s just that the foundation is in the hands of a Free
          software project ” KDE ” leveling the playing field for everybody else. Two good examples
          for commercial partners in Plasma Active are basysKom and open-slx. [BasysKom](http://www.basyskom.com) contributes design and development effort
          into the Contour shell, which forms the basic workspace for Plasma Active. [open-slx](http://www.open-slx.com) (my employer :)) invests into development
          of Plasma Active core components, system integration, packaging, testing and deployment.
          As such, we continously work on turning Plasma Active from Git Repo into something
          end-user ready ” which is also our mission, we want to bring Plasma Active to the masses.
          For this, we™re releasing regularly updated [Live Images of Balsam Professional](http://open-slx.com/?Downloads) running Plasma Active, and we™re working
          hard on making these images also installable. You can test those images in a virtual
          machine (you™ll want one that supports composited graphics, such as Virtual Box), or
          directly on the device. The Balsam Professional Live Image boots out of the box on the
          ExoPC / WeTab, and we™re working on support for more diverse hardware.

To keep track of our different focus points, we™ve created a map of the different
          tracks we follow with our development.

![](http://vizzzion.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/activeroutes.png)

**Where is Plasma Active Today?**

System-wise, the current status is that we have a [bootable live image (Balsam Professional)](http://open-slx.com/?Downloads)
          with a touch-friendly shell, a bunch of apps that can be used. Boot performance is a bit
          on the slow side right now (but improving, there are some changes to the boot process
          planned), runtime performance is pretty good already, as you can see in the videos that
          we™ve posted already. At open-slx we are working on refining the image in terms of
          preconfiguration, performance and so on. We™re also quite close to making the image
          installable, so you can easily install it once (as dualboot on your device, if you wish)
          and then keep tracking Plasma Active development just by updating your packages
          regularly.

During the Meego conference in San Francisco, basysKom demoed parts of Plasma Active
          and the Contour shell. A video has been recorded which gives a good idea of which
          direction we™re going: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3abBR1qLn0](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3abBR1qLn0)

On the software side, we™re working on a bunch of different things 

  * **Resource visualization**: As we™re using Nepomuk as
              the underlying data structure, we™ve implemented data-driven widgets that represent
              Things in the Nepomuk store. These can be local files, online resources, but also
              abstract things like tags, for example. These Resource delegates as we call them
              form basic building blocks of your assets in Plasma Active. 

  * **Web-browser and web-integration**: As The Web is
              one of the most important use-cases for Plasma Active, we™re spending quite some time
              now on making this work really well. After shopping around, we decided that our best
              bet on the web-browser would be a touch-friendly version of Rekonq, using QML. We™ve
              already made some progress towards that direction, but we™re not there yet. 

  * **Share-Like-Connect**: Share-Like-Connect will bring
              ubiquitous (just *had* to use this word once ;)) social networking and sharing to
              Plasma Active. I™ll not go into details here since this topic is way too awesome, so
              we™ll dedicate a separate post to it. 

From my personal point of view as a user, I must say that Plasma Active is becoming a
          rock star. It™s already quite usable for surfing the web, reading news or email. It is not
          stable software yet, more comparable to an Alpha state (there are quite some bugs left to
          be squished, and it™s not feature complete). Our progress is very noticeable, however,
          which is promising for our first targeted released end of September.

I wanted to open a fate feature about this when I first heard of plymouth, but
            reading
            http://fedoramagazine.wordpress.com/2008/10/21/interview-fedora-10s-better-startup/
            really makes me think we should go this way.

Ray's comment starting with "Every flicker and mode change in the boot
            process takes away from the whole experience." is especially interesting. Is it
            okay to track the "don't show grub by default" here?

            [Update to GRUB v2 (Score: 133)](https://features.opensuse.org/308497)
          

Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn't
            going to go away. The code itself isn't well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It's only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don't have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

            [Add ntfs to /etc/filesystems](https://features.opensuse.org/312544)
          

Since I still have a ntfs partition to easily share files between Windows and Linux, I had problems mounting the ntfs partition through Dolphin. First I had to add "ntfs" to /etc/filesystems to make it work with Dolphin.

However, for me, it is no problem to add this line. But I have a few colleagues with now run openSUSE as well, who have no desire to manually change config files. However, they had to, to get their ntfs partition, in their case an external hard drive, running.
I'd really prefer if this line could be added to the /etc/filesystems file.

            [No more auto log-in as default](https://features.opensuse.org/312548)
          

In the installer of openSUSE 11.4 (and I guess also in 11.3, 11.2 and 11.1) the toolbox "log in with this user automaticly" or something like this is choosen as default.

That means, if you just click on "next" during installation, you will auto log in with your user, when you start your system. This happens without any password-check.

This might be good for people who just want to work with their PC and don't think about the system. But it's a big security risk. Think of you got personal files on your harddrive, and your user is logged-in automaticly. Now, other people can easy get access to your /home dir. They just need to start your PC.

So, please, disable this by default!

I™m happy to announce LibreOffice 3.3.3 bugfix release
          for openSUSE. The packages are available in the Build
          Service [LibreOffice:Stable](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/LibreOffice:/Stable/) project. They fix various crashers, usability and translation
          problems, see the [libreoffice-3.3.3.1 release news](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/build/plain/NEWS?id=libreoffice-3.3.3.1) for more details. See also some notes about [openSUSE LibreOffice build](http://en.opensuse.org/LibreOffice).

The openSUSE LO team hopes that you will be happy with this release. Though, any software
          contains bugs and we kindly ask you to [report bugs](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Bugreport_LO). It will help us to
          fix them in the future releases.

**Other information and plans:**

The bugfix release 3.3.4 is planed two months from now. Though, I would rather provide
          LO-3.4.2 packages instead.

I am already working on the LO-3.4 packages. They are more complicated because there were
          significant changes in the build stuff. You might expect something within the next few weeks
          in the [LibreOffice:Unstable](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/LibreOffice:/Unstable/) project.

                Filesystems](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-3-0-Part-2-Filesystems-1263681.html)
        

**The kernel hackers have optimised the Btrfs code and extended it
                to include new functions; a substantially improved tool for testing the experimental
                filesystem is soon to be released. Ext4 now supports the "punch hole" technology for
                deallocating unused memory areas within a file.**

Early this week, Linus Torvalds released a new pre-release (RC) for Linux 3.0. In the
            release mail for the [fourth RC](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1157753), he mentions some more extensive changes to the DRM subsystem.
            Among those changes are [patches ](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.video.dri.devel/58481)that
            improve support for the graphics core of AMD's recently introduced Llano, which was
            introduced between [RC2 and RC3](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Llano-support-union-filesystems-1260710.html).

The Kernel Log is taking the development progress of Linux 3.0 as an opportunity to
            continue its "Coming in 3.0" mini series with a description of the advancements in terms
            of filesystems. PartÃ½1 of the mini-series discussed the changes to the [network drivers and infrastructure](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-3-0-Part-1-Networking-1257847.html); over the coming weeks, further articles
            will discuss the kernel's graphics drivers, architecture code, storage support,
            infrastructure and other hardware drivers.

[Linus Torvalds: Linux
            3.0-rc4](https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/6/21/2)

Mostly the usual small driver one- (or few-) liners, and some bigger changes to drm
            (and md). But also two new smallish drivers (net/usb/kalmia.c, and the ADP8870 backlight
            driver). Some filesystem fixes (btrfs, cifs, afs, xfs, nfsd). 

And a couple of performance regressions: rcu doesn't need threads (and avoiding them
            fixes a performance problem under certain loads) and the conversion from spinlocks to
            mutexes for the anon_vma locking ended up causing a scalability issue that required
            fixing.  (...)

Often the most impressive thing about the open source community is getting to watch
        someone step up to work on a task that's far from fun or glamorous in the traditional sense.
        A good example of that phenomenon is Damon Lynch's [Rapid Photo Downloader](http://www.damonlynch.net/rapid/index.html) (RPD), a
        utility that takes the pain out of what many projects overlook: getting your newly shot
        material off of the camera's memory card and into your computer. Despite the name, RPD
        handles both photos and video, and although its speed is
        impressive, how it really makes your life easier is by keeping you and your storage
        organized. (...)

Everyone has secrets. Some of yours probably live on your computer. If you want to keep digital information private, locking it behind a password won™t really keep it secure. The only real solution is encryption, which scrambles the contents of files, making them unintelligible to anyone without the digital key to unscramble them. [TrueCrypt](http://olex.openlogic.com/packages/truecrypt) can encrypt and decrypt files, documents, and even entire filesystems. The app also provides on-the-fly encryption for enhanced security, which means it can automatically encrypt and decrypt data before reading and writing it, so it™s never on your hard drive in human-readable format.

TrueCrypt is designed to use modern hardware and its multiple cores to speed up encryption and decryption. Besides Linux, it also runs on Windows and Mac operating systems.

Of course TrueCrypt is not your only encryption alternative. [GNU Privacy Guard](http://olex.openlogic.com/packages/gnupg) (GPG) is free software™s answer to [Pretty Good Privacy](http://olex.openlogic.com/packages/pgp) (PGP), the industry standard for encrypting all types of data on the computer. But GPG is a suite of tools that allow you to encrypt and digitally sign arbitrary data such as files and emails, while TrueCrypt offers convenience and the advantage of deniability. (...)

If you spend most of your time typing on your keyboard (and I hope you don™t use that mouse very frequently, if you care for your wrists, that is), getting up to speed and practicing to become a better and faster typist is well worth the time and effort. And measuring something is the first step to improve it.

### For Developers and Programmers




        [Fridrich Strba: Bounding Box of an SVG Elliptical Arc](http://fridrich.blogspot.com/2011/06/bounding-box-of-svg-elliptical-arc.html)
      

We all love ODF, the best and the most vendor-neutral file-format in the Universe and
        its surroundings. But for sure, we have some spots where we would prefer it to be somehow
        less cumbersome. My favourite spot is the need to compute the bounding box of the path
        element when one writes the draw:path into an OpenDocument Graphics file. Without proper
        svg:x, svg:y, svg:height, svg:width and svg:viewBox values the path will not be correctly
        placed.

Computing bounding boxes is not so complicated work when everything is a polygon (which
        is the case in the internal model of basegfx module), but it becomes a bit more complicated
        if an application wants to generate paths including elliptical arcs.

I hit this problem about a year ago when I was working during [my hackweek](http://fridrich.blogspot.com/2010/06/hackweek-v-day-1.html) on an
        improvement of [libwpg](http://libwpg.sourceforge.net). I tried first to
        implement the bounding box of an elliptical arc the lazy hacker way, by googling for what
        other people did. And to my surprise, there is a huge vacuum in what concerns computation of
        a bounding box of the "A" element of an SVG path. So, I settled for the lazy hacker's plan
        B: I abandoned the idea by saying I will handle it later, in the first moment, and by
        implementing a [suboptimal solution](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/filters/commit/?id=bcca44ddb4b046ce133896be1b47efcee70bd163) in the second time. But, since [Eilidh](http://www.derivativezero.com/blog/) did some spectacular progress
        last week in handling elliptic arcs, my lazyness became the bottle-neck of the progress. So,
        it was time to remember those nice times when I was warming the benches of the University,
        dust off my knowledge of mathematical analysis and analytical algebra (or the lack thereof),
        and try to compute the bounding box of an elliptical arc myself.

        [Wazi/Johan Thelin: Rewriting History with Git](http://olex.openlogic.com/wazi/2011/rewriting-history-with-git/)
      

The [Git](http://olex.openlogic.com/packages/git) versioning system allows you to manage large-scale distributed code development projects with thousands of parallel branches. Its powerful checkout, merge, push, and pull capabilities help you work with code branches and clones. Sometimes you, as a contributor, might like to polish a branch you™ve checked out and reduce the number of commits you made before merging it with the master branch. One of Git™s nicer features is that it lets you rewrite history.

Rewriting history is not about changing the end result, but about making things cleaner and clearer. For instance, you can remove commits from the times when you added and later removed debug outputs, or merge the fixes you made to a feature with the commit that added the actual feature. The overall goal is to simplify history for the person who merges your branch into the master branch.

In Git, each repository is a clone of your project™s entire history. This means that your local repository has the same information as the master branch, or any other developer™s branch. All repositories share the common history, and no branch, from Git™s point of view, represents the true history. Therefore you should never rewrite history after you™ve pushed or shared your branch. If you do, other branches will contain alternate versions of the same development history, and your merging could get messy. (...)

One major feature of IPv6 is its ability to auto-configure the host portion of the IP address using the MAC address from the Network Card. We may have seen this already with the local-link address, however, in this tutorial will look at configuring the RAdvD on openSUSE 11 to advertise the Network Prefix and default gateway so we can work with global addresses without any configuration on the hosts. This will differ from DHCP as we do not need to configure the RAdvD with the host addresses. These will come from the hosts own MAC address helping us reach Zero configuration networking. Or at least very little configuration. (...)

      [Robert Schweikert: 1-2-3
        Cloud](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/06/20/1-2-3-cloud/)
    

Towards the end of last year there was an article in openSUSE news announcing the cloud
      efforts in the openSUSE project and on OBS. Well, cloud is still all the rage (see Jos™
      contribution to openSUSE News issue 180) and people just cannot stop talking about cloud
      computing.

Using openSUSE as a host for your cloud infrastructure is also making great progress. We
      have 3 cloud projects in OBS and hopefully these cover your favorite cloud infrastructure
      code, Virtualization:Cloud:Eucalyptus, Virtualization:Cloud:OpenNebula, and
      Virtualization:Cloud:OpenStack. The projects provide repositories for Eucalyptus, OpenNebula,
      and OpenStack, respectively.

We attempt to make it relatively easy to get a cloud up and running. In this process
      OpenNebula and OpenStack have progressed the most. Eucalyptus is working, but due to an issue
      with Eucalyptus and openSSL 1.0 and later (the version in openSUSE) automation has to wait
      until these issues are resolved.

For OpenNebula we now have a [KIWI](http://kiwi.berlios.de)[example](http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:KIWI_Cookbook_ONebula_Cloud) that shows how
      one can get a cloud setup from scratch in less than 2 hours, including the image build. The
      example contains a firstboot workflow for the head node, and self configuration of cloud
      nodes.

For OpenStack [SUSE Gallery](http://susegallery.com/browse) images are
      in the works and will be published in the near future.

All repositories provide packages you can install on running openSUSE systems. If you are
      interested in using openSUSE as the underlying OS for your cloud or if you want to contribute
      to the cloud projects, subscribe to the cloud mailing list [opensuse-cloud@opensuse.org](mailto:opensuse-cloud@opensuse.org)

[Justine Leng: openSUSE buildservice 101](http://obsforandroid.wordpress.com/2011/06/21/opensuse-buildservice-101/)

One of the reasons that Novell created this community-based openSUSE project was to invite
      contributions from independent developers. It also unveiled a new online service that
      automatically builds binary packages from source code. The openSUSE buildservice initially
      focused on building packages for the SUSE variants ” openSUSE, SLES, and SLED ” but the tool
      was later extended to support packages for other major distributions, such as Red Hat, Fedora,
      Mandriva, Debian, and Ubuntu. (...)

[Andres Silva: Custom Setups for Revolutionized Desktop](http://anditosan.blogspot.com/2011/06/custom-setups-for-revolutionized.html)

Ok my friends. Here is the thing: An idea came up recently in the artwork mailing list to
      make openSUSE a little different than other times in the graphical aspect. The idea would be
      to add different default plasma widgets, as well as to make subtle changes to the panels. A
      friend also suggested that it would be cool to create a more socially integrated widget. I
      thought of one that was included in the Kickoff menu. Added to one of the tabs in there, there
      could exist a simple update tracker for different social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter,
      or Google Blogs. Whatever the service that may be, it doesn't matter. The main idea is to add
      something social to the default desktop in KDE under the new release of openSUSE. (...)

### Reviews and Essays




        [Datamation/Cynthia Harvey: 50 Must-Have Open Source Apps for Your Home Office](http://www.datamation.com/open-source/50-must-have-open-source-apps-for-your-home-office-1.html)
      

These days, more and more people work at home at least part of the time. According to
        the U.S. Small Business Administration, more than half of the 29.6 million small businesses
        in the country are home-based.

If you add to those figures the number of people who telecommute to their jobs part of
        the time, the Telework Research Network estimates that between 20 to 30 million people work
        from home at least once a week. And WorldatWork claims that approximately 44 million
        Americans work at home at least one day a year.

Whether they work for themselves, a small business or a large multinational corporation,
        all of these workers need good software for their home offices. And many of these people who
        work at home don't have a lot of money to spend on that software -- especially if they work
        for themselves.

With those workers in mind, we've created a list of open source applications that are
        the most helpful for home offices. Unlike many of our other Datamation lists, we've kept the
        number of applications in each category small”usually just the one or two top apps in each
        category. Nearly all of this software will run on Windows, and these are some of the most
        mature and user-friendly open source applications available. If you're reasonably
        tech-savvy, you should be able to set up and use any of these apps.

Also, recognizing that home office computers get used for more than just work, we've
        included a mix of business software, utilities, and "fun" apps for those times when you need
        a break.

As always, if you'd like to recommend another open source app that we've missed, feel
        free to add a comment below. (...)
