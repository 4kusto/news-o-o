![](/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Tumbleweed-black-green.png)Eighteen [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) snapshots brought several new packages to users last month, which included both  [GNOME 3.24](https://www.gnome.org/news/2017/03/gnome-3-24-released/) and [KDE Plasma 5.9.4](https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.9.4.php).

GNOME 3.24 received most of the hype in snapshot [20170322](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2017-03/msg00765.html), but that release also included [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)’s newest [52.0.1](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/52.0/releasenotes/) version, which added support for WebAssembly, an emerging standard that brings near-native performance to Web-based games, apps, and software libraries without the use of plugins.

Closing out the month, snapshot [20170331](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2017-04/msg00018.html) brought [git 2.12.2](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/RelNotes/2.12.2.txt) that provided a Command Line Interface output fix and [python 3.6.1](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html), which provided some bug fixes and updates to documentation.[ Ruby 2.2](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2014/12/25/ruby-2-2-0-released/) switched to git-branch based patching and patched an exploitable heap overflow vulnerability for [CVE-2016-2339](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-2339).<!-- more -->

[GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) documentation for 3.24 was added to the repositories with snapshot [20170329](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2017-03/msg00918.html). The [Linux Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/) was updated in the snapshot to version [4.10.5](https://opensourceforu.com/2017/03/linux-kernel-4-10-5-brings-networking-improvements/) and improved the driver stack, core networking and few hardware architectures. The snapshot also brought developers [Flatpak 0.91](http://flatpak.org/runtimes.html), which gives developers new build-runtime and build-extension properties with flatpak-builder and makes it easier to build runtimes and extensions. YaST2 had multiple new versions for the -bootloader, -network, -installation and -storage as well as many others.

[KDE Plasma 5.9.4](https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.9.4.php) and [Frameworks 5.32.0](https://www.kde.org/announcements/kde-frameworks-5.32.0.php) came in snapshot [20170328](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2017-03/msg00899.html) and now [knotifications](https://api.kde.org/frameworks/knotifications/html/index.html) has support for [Flatpak](http://flatpak.org/) portals. Additionally, Enterprise Content Management requirements for the 5.32.0 release were added.

The update to cpupower 4.10 in snapshot [20170324](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2017-03/msg00821.html) now has the latest kernel 4.10 sources for its library cleanup patch and cups-filter fixed an [OpenPrinting](http://www.openprinting.org/printers) [bug 1388](https://bugs.linuxfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1388). ImageMagick 6.9.8.2 added the -authenticate option for PDF and support for the namespaces for the security policy in the snapshot as well.

The newest snapshot to arrive in [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) is [20170403](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2017-04/msg00047.html). The snapshot brought the Linux Kernel to version [4.10.8](https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.10.8), which could be the last of the 4.10 kernels as the release candidate for [4.11](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/log/) appears to be getting closer to a release.
