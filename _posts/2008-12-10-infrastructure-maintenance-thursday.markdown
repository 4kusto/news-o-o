Some parts of the openSUSE Project's infrastructure will be down briefly for maintenance tomorrow, December 11th, starting at 10:00 UTC (11:00 CET / 05:00 EST). This should last between 5 and 15 minutes, so the impact on project services should be minimal.

This will impact download servers, the mirror stage server, and the Subversion/git server. See Peter Poeml's [email to opensuse-announce](//lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-announce/2008-12/msg00007.html) for more information.
