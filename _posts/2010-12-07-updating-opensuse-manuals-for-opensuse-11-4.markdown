With the openSUSE distribution, we have a set of openSUSE manuals and QuickStart guides. You can read them online via [http://doc.opensuse.org](http://doc.opensuse.org).Â  They are installed by default on your system so you can access them there as
well.

For openSUSE 11.4, we face the usual challenge of updating the manuals: The documentation writers know what's in the manuals but do not know everything that's changed and the developers know what's changed but may not know all the manuals.

For openSUSE 11.4, I created [feature 310944 [![Read the documentation at doc.opensuse.org](/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/doc.png)](http://news.opensuse.org/2010/12/07/updating-opensuse-manuals-for-opensuse-11-4/doc/)in openFATE](https://features.opensuse.org/310944) which will be the one reference point for documentation. Please add there things that need to be changed in the manuals. I've already added a few things that came to mind.

The Novell documentation team will concentrate on updating the Startup Guide, the GNOME and KDE Quick Guides and the Reference guide. They plan to also add a short chapter on the top use cases so that for example new users know to use LibreOffice as their Office Suite and where to find more information about it.

If anybody is interested in helping improve the documentation, please reach out to the [documentation team](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Documentation_team) on the opensuse-doc mailing list or on IRC on the #opensuse-doc channel on the freenode network. You can also find the sources of the manuals at [https://developer.berlios.de/projects/opensuse-doc/](https://developer.berlios.de/projects/opensuse-doc/).


## Call for help
