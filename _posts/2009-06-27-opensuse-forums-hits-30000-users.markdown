Short but sweet post here: Getting a few numbers on community growth for the [openSUSE Day introduction at LinuxTag](http://zonker.opensuse.org/2009/06/26/opensuse-day-at-linuxtag-tomorrow/), I noticed that the [openSUSE Forums](http://forums.opensuse.org/) **have now passed 30,000 users**!

That's pretty amazing considering that we started the merged forums [on June 10, 2008](https://news.opensuse.org/2008/06/10/opensuse-launches-merged-forums/). In about one year's time, we've seen more than 30,000 people sign up for the forums.

Congrats to everyone who works on the forums, and everyone in the community who has participated!
