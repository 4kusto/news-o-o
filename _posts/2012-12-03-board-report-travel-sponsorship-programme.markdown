_**Summarizing the Travel Support Program**_

_****_[![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3654543066_2c8823cb03_o-300x168.jpg)](https://news.opensuse.org/?attachment_id=14680)
The openSUSE Travel Support Program aims to support contributors representing openSUSE at events, conferences and hack-fests with their travel and hotel costs. The program pays up to 80% of the travel and/or hotel costs for contributors who could not afford going to these events otherwise. In turn the contributors make a worthy contribution at the event and report back to the openSUSE community about what they did.

The Travel Committee also decides on travel support for openSUSE events like the openSUSE Conference and the openSUSE Summit.

_**Current Committee includes**_



	
  * Â Kostas Koudaras (ambassador event planning)

	
  * Â Izabel Valverde (finance & planning)

	
  * Â Agustin Benito Bethencourt (openSUSE Team Lead at SUSE)


_**Results**_

The Travel Support Team has till now sponsored various conferences including FOSDEM, Cerea Fair, Solutions Linux, COSCUP, Indiana Linux Fest, Linux Tag, SELF, Libre Office Graphic Meeting and loads of others. Along with this, the Travel Committee also handles sponsorship handling for openSUSE Summit and openSUSE Conference which in itself are very tedious tasks.

_**NumbersÂ **_



	
  * TSP : 15

	
  * Summit : Â 11

	
  * openSUSE Conference : 21


A total of 37 sponsorships were given out this year.
