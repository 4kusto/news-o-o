The openSUSE Community News letter is published each week and the forum section has been edited since March 2009 by @caf4926. Starting issue 149 @knurpht (A Global Moderator for the openSUSE Forum) will be editing the Forum section of the news letter. @knurpht is well placed to find and list interesting threads from the forum. This should ensure the continuation of a great community news letter.
