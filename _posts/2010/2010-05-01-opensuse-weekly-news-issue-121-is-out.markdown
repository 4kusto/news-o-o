Like KMyMoney, which is a personal finance manager and Skrooge, a comparable new star on the KDE finance management sky, Assuma, a membership management software for associations and LemonPOS, a free point of sales system."

"The second day of the KDE Finance Sprint saw us doing more presentations regarding our respective applications (Kraft, KMyMoney, Skrooge), and working on two main subjects:  Common Icon Set  This is a task we have been wanting to finish for... long :p ! The idea is that now that these apps are part of the KDE family, they should somehow look more "oxygenish". Nuno sent us a spreadsheet where we would describe the icons we need, and Alvaro (KMyMoney), Thomas (Kraft) and myself (Skrooge) finally completed this list.  I know the oxygen guys have enough to eat on their plates, so we are not expecting this to happen very soon, we will just be happy when it comes up =D"

"Before April 8th, developers targeting the iPhone had to deal with this section:  3.3.1 — Applications may only use Documented APIs in the manner prescribed by Apple and must not use or call any private APIs.  The above is a pretty reasonable requirement as it gives Apple the chance to not have to maintain and support internal APIs, temporary APIs or APIs that have not fully matured."

"At one of the project meetings, it was highlighted that our selected video service provider isn’t the easiest to reach from some parts of the world. So I was assigned the task of finding an alternative/complimentary service that would be acceptable.  The decision I came to, and confirmed with others that they were happy, was to use YouTube as a complimentary service to BlipTV. So yes people we now have an Official YouTube channel. I’d like to say a huge thanks to Leslie Hawthorn for enabling this for us, and the fine folks over at Google & YoutTube.

####  [Alex Barrios: First round of pictures from the FLISOL Venezuela](//lizards.opensuse.org/2010/04/26/first-round-of-pictures-from-the-flisol-venezuela/)


"The experience of this year with openSUSE FLISOL this was very rewarding … Attendees were very interested in our distribution and of course “freed” a lot of machines with only openSUSE Installed.  A lot of happy faces after they see YaST and how easy somethings are.  Of course, the main character was our beloved “Gecko”, who captivated eyes, picking fights, tears and others because they all wanted a bit of it! xD"  


####  [Michal Hrusecky: LinuxExpo 2010](//michal.hrusecky.net/index.php/blog/show/LinuxExpo-2010.html)


"For those who didn't know, last week there was an event called LinuxExpo in Prague. And we off course went there with the Czech part of openSUSE Boosters team to talk about openSUSE. Other colleagues also helped with running openSUSE booth. And some of our community members we standing around talking to people as well.  We had our HP TouchSmart machine with us (same one as we had on FOSDEM), but this time we had only one of them. But to make things more attractive for visitors, we took steering wheel with pedals with us and we had Torcs preinstalled. So people wasn't only touching our desktop and playing with camera, but also racing."

####  [Make Tech Easier/Tavis J. Hampton: How to Use KDE’s Clipboard and Klipper App](//maketecheasier.com/use-kde-clipboard-and-klipper-app/2010/04/26)


"The clipboard is one of the oldest and most important features of desktop computing. With it, you can temporarily store pictures, images, and even file information in the system’s memory, and then copy or move that information to a new destination.  KDE has an advanced clipboard system, largely due to a small program called Klipper, which can store more than one piece of data. KDE also has the ability to copy and move files with copying and pasting, and automatic creation of files using clipboard data."  


###  For Commandline/Script Newbies





####  [ITworld/Sandra Henry-Stocker: How-To: Grep Tricks for Linux Users](//www.itworld.com/it-managementstrategy/106032/how-to-grep-tricks-linux-users)


"The first of these tricks allows you to create a list of files that contain whatever string you are looking for. It uses the -l (list just the file names, not the matched content) option plus the -r option for recursing through subdirectories. This can help you find files that you might be looking for without distracting you with all the reasons particular files matched your search criteria."  


###  For Developers and Programmers





####  [Stefan Seyfried: Rebuilding a single kernel module](//seife.kernalert.de/blog/2010/04/28/rebuilding-a-single-kernel-module/)


"Due to Bug 596844, I had to rebuild the i915 module with a patch. I have done things like that quite often over the last years, and every time I have to dig through the documentation, so I’ll put it up here in the hope that I’ll find it easier in the future and that it might be useful for somebody else ;)"  


###  For System Administrators





####  [Petr Baudis: Fixing NTP Refusing to Sync](//log.or.cz/?p=80)


"I have just been confronted by NTP absolutely refusing to touch my system’s clock. The trouble with NTP is that it is absolute PITA to debug it at all since when it does not get in sync with its peers, it goes at great lengths to make its reasons as incomprehensible as possible.  For some reason, my system had absolutely massive drift – something in the order of half a second per minute, making the clock drift by several tens of minutes per day. So I installed NTP and hoped that it would magically fix up the issue, but it turns out that NTP by itself is absolutely unhelpful not only in cases of big offset, but also in cases of big drift – it will fix your clock when it is slightly inaccurate, but not when it is inaccurate a lot (…that is, when you would want to use it all the more)."  


####  [Dedoimedo.com: Collecting and analyzing Linux kernel crashes - crash](//www.dedoimedo.com/computers/crash.html)


"Welcome to the sixth article in the long series on Kernel crash collection and analysis. We have started the series with LKCD, an older utility, followed by a very long review of Kdump, both of which are available as PDF guides, free for download. Next, we learned about new features and changes in the Kdump setup and functionality on openSUSE 11.2 and CentOS 5.4. Now, it's time to start processing the collected memory cores.  Today, we will do just that. Learn how to use the crash utility to open the dumped memory cores, collected at the time of kernel crashes, and read the information contained therein. Please note that this article focuses mainly on being able to use and process the crash dumps. We will focus on the crash analysis more deeply in the next tutorial. "

####  [Jakub Steiner: Symbolic Moment](//jimmac.musichall.cz/log/?p=974)


"It was almost 9 years ago when the first ever scalable icon theme Gorilla came to be. One of the things I imagined to happen soon after was that the icon theme would inherit the colors from the widget theme to really feel integrated. That part never happened. Until now. But this time it’s not for the default theme and not because of visual integration. In fact, with 2.30 we seemingly stepped back from SVG and started using bitmaps when we introduced the high resolution icons."

"One of the outstanding features of openSUSE is the Sat solver for package dependency resolution.  Somewhat unknown to most developers, Satsolver provides bindings for the three major scripting languages: Perl, Python and Ruby. The bindings provide an easy way to learn about the Satsolver API, to explore package metadata and play what-if scenarios installing, updating and deleting packages.  The bindings are created using SWIG together with an application layer on top of the raw libsatsolver. The focus is on usability and support of the scripting language, while hiding internals of the Satsolver implementation. (...)"

###  Announcement





####  [KDE.news/Andreas Pakulat: KDevelop 4.0 Stable Released into the Wild](//www.kdenews.org/2010/05/01/kdevelop-40-stable-released-wild)


"The KDevelop Hackers are proud and happy to announce that KDevelop 4.0 is finally available as a stable release. Released together is the first version of KDevelop PHP plugins, which make KDevelop a very interesting option for PHP developers."

####  [ars technica/Ryan Paul: MeeGo mobile Linux will also do laptops and desktops](//arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2010/04/meego-mobile-linux-will-also-do-laptops-and-desktops.ars)


"Intel has revealed that it is developing a variant of the Linux-based MeeGo operating system that will run on conventional desktop and laptop computers. This move could substantially broaden MeeGo's scope, transforming it from a mobile platform into a general purpose Linux distro.  The open source MeeGo project emerged earlier this year when Intel and Nokia combined their respective mobile Linux platforms. MeeGo, which is endorsed by the Linux Foundation, aims to reduce fragmentation in the mobile ecosystem by providing a vendor-neutral Linux platform that supports a number of different hardware architectures and form factors. It is designed for mobile and embedded computing, with heavy optimization for ARM processors and Intel's Atom chips."  


####  [LinuxPlanet/Joe Brockmeier: NetworkManager a Solid Tool with New Features](//www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/reports/7049/1/)


"Applications like Firefox and OpenOffice.org get all the glory. They're highly visible as cornerstone applications of the free desktop. But what about the background apps that do the grunt work and sit silently in the background, ignored unless we run into a bug? One of the vital, yet unsung, applications Linux users depend on is NetworkManager."  


####  [IBM developerWorks/Roderick W. Smith: Linux on 4KB-sector disks: Practical advice](//www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-4kb-sector-disks/index.html)


"Starting in December 2009, hard disk manufacturers began introducing disks that use 4096-byte sectors rather than the more common 512-byte sectors. Although this change is masked by firmware that breaks the 4096-byte physical sectors into 512-byte logical sectors for the benefit of the operating system, the use of larger physical sectors has implications for disk layout and system performance. This article examines these implications, including benchmark tests illustrating the likely real-world effects on some common Linux® file systems. As disks with 4096-byte sectors become more common throughout 2010 and beyond, strategies for coping with these new disks will become increasingly important."

"Network software giant Novell has claimed it is the first Linux vendor to achieve 5,000 certified ISV applications and has increased its Linux market share against Red Hat, according to IDC.  The company said its independent software vendor (ISV) and partner ecosystem for supporting intelligent workload management has helped drive SUSE Linux Enterprise adoption."

"Recently, Mercurial author Matt Mackall has decided to try to devote his full time to working on the distributed source control tool. He's doing this by seeking funding from companies that use Mercurial or sell Mercurial-based products.  To find out where Mackall is planning to take Mercurial development, and the state of the project today, we asked if he'd be willing to answer a few questions. Here's what we found out."
