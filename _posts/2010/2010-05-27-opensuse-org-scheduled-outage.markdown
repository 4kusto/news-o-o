On Saturday, June 5th, most of openSUSE.org will be down due to a network upgrade in the data center.  The outage is scheduled to take place between 13:00 and 17:00 GMT (9:00 AM to 2:00 PM EDT).  During that time, users can expect the following:



	
  * Full outage

	
    * openSUSE wikis

	
    * openSUSE blogs




	
  * Intermittent outages

	
    * www.opensuse.org

	
    * files.opensuse.org





The staging version of these sites will be similarly affected.  In addition, most novell.com sites will either be unavailable or have reduced functionality.  This outage should not have any affect on the software or forum sites.
