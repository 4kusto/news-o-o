[![](/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Conf2010_250px2+register.png)](//conference.opensuse.org/indico/event/osc2010)Ladies and Gentlemen,

Just one week to go untill the openSUSE conference opens its doors. We moved all [Birds of a Feather (Bof)](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_Feather_%28computing%29) sessions and workshops out of the conference tool into the [wiki](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_BoF).

Put your slides, descriptions etc. up there, add new BoF sessions off your own.

Take the chance to get your topic covered and discuss it with the right people during the conference. During the conference we'll have white boards where we/you schedule more BoFs ad hoc.

And, if you have not registered for the conference yet, please do so [here](//conference.opensuse.org/indico//confRegistrationFormDisplay.py/display?confId=0) to assure we have enough chairs. And remember the conference is free of charge, offers interesting talks and gives you the best chance to meet people in person.
