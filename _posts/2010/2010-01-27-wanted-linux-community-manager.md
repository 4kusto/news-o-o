At the end of this month Zonker, our openSUSE community manager for the last two years, will be [leaving](//www.dissociatedpress.net/2010/01/25/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-geekos/) Novell. On behalf of the whole openSUSE community I would like to take a moment to thank Zonker for all the great work he's done. openSUSE is a larger, more open and more engaged community than ever before â€“ one where experienced hackers and new Linux users can all find a home. Zonker has been at the forefront of our community outreach, and has been a great steward for SUSE. As he now moves to start the next chapter in his career, I want to thank him for all his hard work and wish him the very best for the future.
The openSUSE community is more vibrant than ever and we want to sustain the momentum. We are looking for the next great community leader who can help SUSE reach even more people and make an even bigger impact on the world. If you're passionate about Linux, love to work with people around the world, have some ideas about marketing, and think you can make an impact, we want to hear from you! Please contact Joe Goss (jgoss at novell dot com) if you would like to be considered.
In the meantime, I will be working with Andreas Jaeger and other Novell colleagues in marketing and engineering to cover openSUSE community relations activities. Thanks everyone for your inquiries and support.
