We will have a service outage this saturday (21 August) due to work on power supply in one of our server rooms. This means the following services will not be accessable on that day:



	
  * build.opensuse.org

	
  * api.opensuse.org

	
  * software.opensuse.org

	
  * stage.opensuse.org

	
  * hermes.opensuse.org

	
  * users.opensuse.org

        
  * board.opensuse.org



The content on download.opensuse.org will come from a fall back system and will not get updated during saturday.
