Javier sent us the following announcement:


<blockquote>It's my pleasure to announce the next KDE Bug triage :-)

It will begin next Friday (13th) and end on Monday (16th).

The aim of this bug triage is to help make KDE a bit better. You don't need to have any special skills. The most important thing is that you're interested in helping us to clean the bug list so developers can focus on fixing the bugs!

So, let's squash bugs together! Join us in the #opensuse-kde IRC channel on Freenode :-)

For more info on bug squashing KDE, take a look [here](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Bug_Squashing_KDE)!

To see a list of open bugs is [here](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Bug_Squashing_KDE_bugreports) (automatically generated).

Happy KDE bug squashing!</blockquote>
