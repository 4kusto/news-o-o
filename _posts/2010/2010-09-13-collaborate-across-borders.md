Including a complete [sidetrack](//conference.opensuse.org/indico//sessionDisplay.py?sessionId=28&confId=0#20101022) about [OpenOffice.org](//www.OpenOffice.org) - the free and open productivity suite for word processing, spreadsheets, presentations and more.

Linux drives not only your laptop and the server your website is running on, the penguin also goes beyond heavy metal. From very small devices like smartphones to virtualized workloads in the cloud. And so is the openSUSE conference.

Talks in this area include a presentation of Smeegol, an openSUSE spin of the mobile computing interface [MeeGo](//MeeGo.com), a guide to build your own version of Google's mobile operating system [Android](//www.android.com), working with the [openSUSE Build Service](//build.opensuse.org) and [Nokia's OVI store](https://store.ovi.com/) and a workshop how to control your own cloud services.

[SUSE Linux Enterprise](//www.novell.com/linux) is an industry leader trusted with mission-critical data centers and desktops. The ideas that find their way into supported, hardened structures of SLE have their genesis in the flexible, affordable community development that is openSUSE. [Find out how openSUSE can help you achieve your business goals.](//conference.opensuse.org/indico//sessionDisplay.py?sessionId=21&confId=0#20101022) Share your ideas and explore how future developments can provide innovative and effective solutions.

### Whether you are new to Linux or are an expert....


Are  you a Linux Newbie? This is a great chance to get to know the [Free Software philosophy](//www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html) and to meet the most famous hackers of our project and the many other Free Software projects openSUSE works with. There will be workshops and small-scale meetings to help you [learn to work with and contribute](//conference.opensuse.org/indico//sessionDisplay.py?sessionId=22&confId=0#20101022) to Linux and openSUSE.

The [openSUSE Build Service](//build.opensuse.org) is a powerful tool that enables developers to deliver their software to users of major distributions, creating packages for current and past releases of [Ubuntu](//www.ubuntu.com/), [Fedora](//fedoraproject.org/), [Red Hat](//www.redhat.com/), [SUSE Linux Enterprise](//www.novell.com/linux), [Mandriva](//www.mandriva.com/) and of course openSUSE. You can easily create repositories and use the dashboard to get an overview of the build process with its easy-to-use web interface. The Build Service uses virtualization to build each package on the distribution it is meant for, ensuring compatibility and stability. Join the thousands of developers already using OBS and[ learn how to use it](//conference.opensuse.org/indico//sessionDisplay.py?sessionId=18&confId=0#20101020) at the openSUSE Conference!


### To shape openSUSE and because it's fun!


openSUSE is an international project that brings together the brightest minds from around the world to create an innovative and powerful all purpose operating system, enabling people across the globe to take advantage of Linux and Free Software. You  don't have to be a technical guru to help shape openSUSE. You can contribute to the growth of this exciting open source project, help to define the direction and build the  community. At the conference [you'll be introduced](//conference.opensuse.org/indico//sessionDisplay.py?sessionId=25&confId=0#20101023) to the new openSUSE  strategy and discover how 'Less is  More' applies to crowdsourcing the openSUSE Media. You will get to know and work with key people, talk with them, be inspired by them!

There is a person behind every piece of our code, and we think that human interaction is vitally important. This is great chance to talk about your experience using openSUSE, face to face with the people behind it. To tell us what's wrong and what's right, or maybe just have a sneak preview into  the future of openSUSE. And of course, one of the most enjoyable aspects of any conference - the chance to [get together](//conference.opensuse.org/indico//sessionDisplay.py?sessionId=36&confId=0#20101021) over a coffee, beer or a keyboard, with people who share your enthusiasm!

Free and Open Source Software is all about community. Collaborating together, we discover that we have more similarities than differences, and we each offer something of value.
