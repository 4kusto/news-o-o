The openSUSE Marketing Team is proud to host Collaboration Days during the month of December.  Each designated day, we will focus on a specifc area related to marketing.  The purpose of this is to get some work done on that topic to strengthen our ability to promote openSUSE to the world.

It is a day that is meant to be busy and productive for the team as well as an opportunity for non-team members to stop by and offer their perspectives and help out as we hack away.  As this is an open process, we encourage everyone to come join us, even if you are not directly related to openSUSE.  All perspectives are important and we welcome you all.


## Planned Agenda:




### <!-- more -->




### 6 December 2010 - Ambassador Support Review


(Moderators - Carlos Ribeiro, Kostas Koudaras)

**Focus:**
Review existing support materials for Ambassadors and identify key checkpoint materials such as a checklist for booths.  Review openSUSE Booth design concepts and strengthen reference materials such as talking points and developing strong presentation/speaking skills.


### 13 December 2010 - Marketing Materials Review


(Moderators - Chuck Payne, Bryen Yunashko)

**Focus:**
Review current posted materials including, but not limtied to, brochures, slide presentations, talking points, etc.  Strengthen existing materials and add new materials where needed.  Review placement on our wiki to ensure material is readily available for all who need it.


### 21 December 2010 - PR and Social Media Review


(Moderated by Manu Gupta and Jos Poortvliet)

**Focus:**
Review our strategy for reaching out to the press/media and our methods for publicizing through social media outlets including blogs, Twitter/Identi.ca, Facebook and other online venues.  Document our methods and ensure we have caretakers for all sites.


## How will this work?


Think "hackfest."  Each day, the moderators of each event will post a list of suggested assignments.  You are welcome to select from the list or create an assignment that you feel you can best contribute to.  Moderators are there to offer advice and guidance, not to control what you wish to do.  it is your chance to express yourself freely and creatively.

During the Collaboration Day, you will work either on your own or with partners as you choose.  Occasionally, moderators may host brief discussion sessions to review the assignments and status.

**Where:**
We meet in the #openSUSE-Marketing IRC channel on Freenode.  That's where the list will be hosted.  However, you are not expected to put your full attention onto the channel,  it is just a place to ask questions and get some advice.  The majority of your time you will "meet" in your preferred environment where you feel you work best.

Collaboration Days begin at 9:00 UTC and end at 24:00 UTC

**_It's your day, it's openSUSE's day!  Let's make the most of it!_**
