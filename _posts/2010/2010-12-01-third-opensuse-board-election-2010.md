## Seats to get elected


In this election we will have 2 seats to get elected, as the  election period of [Pascal Bleser](//en.opensuse.org/User:Pbleser) and [Henne Vogelsang](//en.opensuse.org/User:Hennevogel) ends.  We will probably also get a new chairman, as [Michael LÃ¶ffler](//en.opensuse.org/User:Michl19) will leave as well.

So in this election the openSUSE community elects two new members.

With the existing company affiliations in the board (Pavol -  Novell, Bryen - none, Rupert - openSLX) the restraint is that at most  one of the additional elected  persons can be affiliated with Novell and  one with openSLX.


## Call for candidates and nominations


<!-- more -->If you intend to run for the board or have any questions, please contact the Election Committee by sending an email to [election-officials@opensuse.org](mailto:election-officials@opensuse.org). Also, if you want to nominate somebody else, tell the election officials and they will contact the nominated person and ask whether s/he will run for the board.

Prospective candidates are encouraged to read [this](//lwn.net/Articles/211548/) lwn.net article that gives some insight on how to apply to a board position.


## What is the openSUSE Board?[![Image from flickr.com / User Dorkstar ](/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/384826104_563552a2e0_z.jpg)](//news.opensuse.org/2010/12/01/third-opensuse-board-election-2010/384826104_563552a2e0_z/)


The [openSUSE board](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board) consists of 5 members elected by the community and one chair person appointed by Novell. It was setup to lead the overall project. It's main tasks are:



	
  * Act as a central point of contact

	
  * Help resolve conflicts

	
  * Communicate community interests to Novell

	
  * Facilitate communication with all areas of the community

	
  * Facilitate decision making processes where needed.
