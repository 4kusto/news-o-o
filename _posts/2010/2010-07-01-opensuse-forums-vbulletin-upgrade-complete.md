The vBulletin software that is the 'Nuts and Bolts' behind the openSUSE Forum has just undergone a major upgrade from v3 to v4. This resulted in some considerable down time on 30 June 2010. However, the results are impressive and openSUSE Forums now has a completely new look. It's more than that though, the upgrade adds a much improved look and feel. The Forum Team expect some teething problems, as well as much discussion and opinion about the change. As far as changes go, I'd put this on a par with the kde move from 3 to 4. The dust will settle soon enough. Be assured the Forum Staff will be ready and willing to offer advice and assistance relating to this and of course normal help/advice with openSUSE.
