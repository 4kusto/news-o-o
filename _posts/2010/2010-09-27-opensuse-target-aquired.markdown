Hi all,![Future Lizard!\](//en.opensuse.org/images/a/af/Future.png)

Over the last week you have all given input on the new strategy document describing the target users of openSUSE. It saw quite a bit of rewriting and rephrasing but it seems the description fitted most of your perceptions. We have incorporated all the comments into the document and a new iteration can be found on [co-ment](https://lite.co-ment.com/text/lNPCgzeGHdV/view/).

<!-- more -->Furthermore, the next piece of text has been added: [What does openSUSE offer its users?](https://lite.co-ment.com/text/lNPCgzeGHdV/view/) Like with "Target Users", we would really appreciate it if you could give your input on co-ment but we will accept any kind of input on any channel we can follow. So if co-ment isn't your thing, feel free to comment below this post, on the forums or anywhere else. For those new to [co-ment](//www.co-ment.com/about/) - it is a pretty awesome commenting tool under the [GNU Affero GPL](//www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/agpl-3.0.html).

Giving your input on [co-ment](https://lite.co-ment.com/text/lNPCgzeGHdV/view/) will make the discussion a bit more structured and easier for everyone to follow. How-to: select some text you want to comment on (a word, a few words, a sentence) and choose the little yellow + sign on the top-left of the page to add your comment. If you click a colored section of the text, you can see the comments which have been made to that section it and add your own voice to the discussion. Easy peasy!

You can find the document [here](https://lite.co-ment.com/text/lNPCgzeGHdV/view/). And for reference [here the openSUSE Strategy portal](//en.opensuse.org/Portal:Strategy) on the wiki. Please have fun!

Greetings,
Your strategy team
