As mentioned in earlier posts, the new English wiki is scheduled to go live on Monday.  Here are a few technical details about the change itself:



	
  * Schedule

	
    * The transition will begin on Monday, July 12 at 17:00 GMT (1:oo PM EDT)

	
    * The move should be completed in 10 - 15 minutes




	
  * During the move

	
    * The wikis will stay live

	
    * The old and new English wikis will behave unexpectedly at some points

	
    * www.opensuse.org and the other language wikis should not be affected at all




	
  * After the move

	
    * The old wiki (currently en.opensuse.org) will be located at old-en.opensuse.org

	
    * The new wiki (currently wiki.opensuse.org) will be located at en.opensuse.org

	
    * wiki.opensuse.org will be an alias for en.opensuse.org





The wiki team has worked hard to get the new wiki tested and perfected for Monday.  However, if any issues are discovered after the switch, please send a message to webmaster@opensuse.org or file a bug at //bugzilla.novell.com under the openSUSE.org product.
