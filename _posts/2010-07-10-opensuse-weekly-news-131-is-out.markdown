     We are pleased to announce our **131** issue of the **openSUSE Weekly News**. 
In this Issue we have collected very interesting things. The Top4 you  can see on the header of this issue. Sadly i have bad news about our  Kernel Review and PostgreSQL Review with openSUSE Flavor. Our  Correspodent Rares Aoianei has crashed his PC. So we can't read anything  from him in this Issue. But we hope to see him soon. We send him on  this way our best wishesÂ :-) What was interesting too in the Week? The 11.3 distribution has reached  the Goldmaster Status. That means, we have now the Build who goes to our  openSUSE Box. So we are happy to get the box soon. If you would like,  you can pre-order the Box on [this](http://www.edv-buchversand.de/suse/product.php?cnt=product&id=sus181) Page. So that's all from my Side,

#### [Maintenance for openSUSE 11.0 extended](../2010/07/05/maintenance-for-opensuse-11-0-extended/)




     "openSUSE 11.0 was released on 19th of June 2008 and was  planned to be under security maintenance for two years. Upon multiple  requests from the community, the SUSE Security and Maintenance Team has  decided to extend the maintenance period of openSUSE 11.0 until openSUSE  11.3 release, which is scheduled for July 14th 2010. 
     We will stop handling new requests at that day and plan to  finish with the last update on July 21st 2010 to assue that openSUSE  11.0 users have a smooth upgrade path to openSUSE 11.3. Special thanks  to Dirk Mueller who innitiated this." 



#### [openSUSE Wiki “ Episode II: A new hope](../2010/07/05/a-new-hope/)




     "You hear it in the bushes since quite some time, rumors spread  and people whisper about it: A new wiki for the openSUSE project is  coming very soon! The openSUSE Wiki team is in the last preparations to  launch the new wiki on Monday the 12th of July 
     As with all shiny new things the new wiki is different than  the old one. But different how? You can sum that up in one word:  Structure 
     The current wiki, online since the start of the openSUSE  project in 2005,  grew wild into something that is not maintainable  anymore. This is because content in it is in no way structured and we  use it as a simple information dump. We don™t have any rules on how to  present information or how to connect it to related bits and everybody  is just adding pages. It makes adding content very easy but it neglects  completely the biggest group of users of this wiki: the readers. On a  normal day we have 10 people adding and 78.000 reading content. Yet we  do very little to ensure that those 78.000 people find what they are  looking for." 



#### [The devil is in the details “ What changes on monday for  the wiki oldtimers?](../2010/07/08/the-devil-is-in-the-details/)




     "A couple of days ago I gave you the big picture on what will  happen to en.opensuse.org on Monday when we switch to the new wiki. Now  let me go into the nitty gritty details of the change to the new wiki. I  especially want to focus on the changes important for the people who  are familiar with the old wiki. Here we go. ..." 



#### [openSUSE News: openSUSE Wiki Change Scheduled](../2010/07/09/opensuse-wiki-change-scheduled/)




    "As mentioned in earlier posts, the new English wiki is  scheduled to go live on Monday.  Here are a few technical details about  the change itself: 




	
  * Schedule

	
    * The transition will begin on Monday, June 12 at 17:00 GMT (1:oo  PM EDT)

	
    * The move should be completed in 10 “ 15 minutes




	
  * During the move

	
    * The wikis will stay live

	
    * The old and new English wikis will behave unexpectedly at some  points

	
    * www.opensuse.org and the other language wikis should not be  affected at all




	
  * After the move

	
    * The old wiki (currently en.opensuse.org) will be located at  old-en.opensuse.org

	
    * The new wiki (currently wiki.opensuse.org) will be located at  en.opensuse.org

	
    * wiki.opensuse.org will be an alias for en.opensuse.org







     The wiki team has worked hard to get the new wiki tested and  perfected for Monday.  However, if any issues are discovered after the  switch, please send a message to webmaster@opensuse.org or file a bug at  [http://bugzilla.novell.com](http://bugzilla.novell.com/) under the openSUSE.org product."

#### [Martin Schlander: Attention openSUSE KDE Factory Users](http://mschlander.wordpress.com/2010/07/09/attention-opensuse-kde-factory-users/)




     "With openSUSE 11.3 less than a week away, soon it™ll be time  to think about 11.3+1 which will be released in March 2011 with KDE SC  4.6. 
     This should interest people using the KDE Factory repository a  great deal, because it means that Factory should move to KDE SC 4.5 RC  very shortly, and in November it will move to KDE SC 4.6 Beta. Leaving  users with no choice other than using 4.6 Beta or downgrading to 4.4.4  which will be the version officially supported in 11.3 and available in  the KDE Stable repository. 
     In other words, if you don™t wish to use KDE SC 4.6 Beta in  November, don™t use the KDE Factory repository! Switch to the KDE Stable  repository, which already has 4.4.4. Consider yourself warned."

#### [Noel Power: My mono Hackweek (restored)](http://noelpower.blogs.ie/2010/07/07/my-mono-hackweek-restored/)




     "It was hackweek here again in Novell, I spent an enjoyable (  but also sometimes frustrating ) couple of days trying to extend support  for Mono in Openoffice.org. Recently on IRC there was some interest in  using C# to write extensions for Openoffice.org where it became clear  that only being able to ˜drive™ Openoffice.org from C# is severely  limiting. To provide decent custom functionality you need to be able to  get called by Openoffice.org, integrate with the Menus and Toolbars etc.  Clearly to write an extension you need to be able to be ˜plugged™ in..  There are many many C# developers ( and potential extension developers )  and we are just ignoring them. I have to admit I always wanted to play  with C#/DotNet/Mono and I even proposed a GSOC task to try and faciliate  thisÂ ;-) 
     Unfortunately the project didn™t make the cut but fortunately  there is Hackweek yay! So, I spent the last couple of days playing  around with Mono and C#, first I wrote a new loader for Mono, this  allowed me to use recomp to register some services, next I modified  unopkg to accept a Mono component bundled in an extension." 



#### [Miguel de Icaza: First MonoTouch Book is out](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Jul-06-1.html)




     "I am very excited to see the first MonoTouch book published. 
     You could not ask for a better team of authors to explain the  MonoTouch and the iPhone platform. Chris, Craig, Martin, Rory, and  Wally. 
     This book was a team effort by various active members of the  MonoTouch community. They nurtured the community from the start by  exploring MonoTouch, by reporting bugs and missing functionality in  MonoTouch and by guiding .NET developers through the new world of  building iPhone applications. 
     Congratulations on the book release guys!" 



#### [Miguel de Icaza: Microsoft MS-PL code in Mono](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Jul-07.html)




    "Over the past couple of years Microsoft has been open sourcing  some key .NET libraries under the MS-PL or Apache 2 license. 
     We are tremendously grateful to Microsoft for making these  components open source. This has allowed us to distribute this in the  past, and we are going to be bundling a lot more of it with Mono 2.8: 
     In Mono 2.8, the following assemblies and code come from  Microsoft: ..."

#### [#310080: KDE 4.6 for opensuse 11.4](https://features.opensuse.org/310080)




     "I realise we are using a time based release, and no longer  chase feature releases, but 11.3 will ship with KDE 4.4 when 4.5 will  ship three weeks later. 
     I realise you don't just drop in an entirely new DE version a  week before opensuse hits RC, but it would be a crying shame for two  releases in a row, eight months apart, both to use an 'old' major  release of KDE. 
     For this reason I would be very keen to look at the KDE 4.6  release schedule (should be end of january), and see if we cannot plan  to include it in opensuse 11.4 (which in theory is due end of february  at the earliest)." 



#### [#310086:  NetworkManager: honor NTP server received via DHCP](https://features.opensuse.org/310086)




     "DHCP allows distribute information about NTP Servers that the  clients should use. This works pretty well when using the "traditional  ifup based" network configuration. It doesn't work however with  NetworkManager." 



#### [#310088: integrate webkit in evolution for html mail](https://features.opensuse.org/310088)




     "Most people i know uses Outlook for mail. When i receive HTML  mail on evolution sent by outlook it does not always looks as when it  was sent. Since webkit seems lightweight and renders HTML very well i  think it would be suitable for adding this feature to evolution." 



#### [#310089:  Remove not needed Repositroies after oneklick was successfull](https://features.opensuse.org/310089)




     "When using Oneklick install, usaly the needed repositories are  added to the repository list, even if you just need only one package  from that repository. 
     if you are using One Klick Install multiple times the user  probertly would end up with an unnecessary long list of ununsed  repositories. how about removing them shortly after One Klick Install  has finished or at least ask the User for removing or keep the useed  repository. 
     Its enoying to delete them manualy everytime you do an  OneklickInstall." 



#### [#310090:  Release cycle - guarantied dup - sync with Distros](https://features.opensuse.org/310090)




     "openSUSE should have a shorter and synced with Ubuntu/Fedora  release cycle. If there is an easy and guarantied way to dist-upgrade  like a script working: (...)" 



#### [#310092:  have an option to apply the gnome "monitor preferences" to xorg.conf](https://features.opensuse.org/310092)




     "There's a problem with gnome monitor prefereces: the  preferences if for the user and the user is only known after the login,  but X starts and shows GDM before the login. So there is an extra  flicker (in my case it flickers twice for some reason) when changing  from the gdm monitor settings to the gnome desktop monitor settings." 



#### [#310098: Integrate KNemo with NetworkManager](https://features.opensuse.org/310098)




     "My recommendation is to integrate KNemo with NetworkManager. 
     KNemo which provides interface, network and download  statistics. The NetworkManager is missing these features. We can have  the best of both worlds in a single package that would use a single  applet and icon."

#### [Michael Meeks: OpenOffice & GStreamer ...](http://www.gnome.org/%7Emichael/blog/2010-07-06-ooo-gstreamer.html)




     "The other day the, secret, internal, 'from scratch' re-write  of GStreamer integration was announced by StarDivision. You can read the  wonderful news on their corporate blog. There is also some amusingly  mis-directed marketing effort focused on Ubuntu as well. What does this  mean for Linux usersÂ ? Nothing. With this great leap forward in Linux  support you are unlikely to notice any difference at all; whyÂ ? Because  all Linux distributions (SUSE, RedHat, Debian, Ubuntu, Mandriva, and  more than I can list) have already been shipping GStreamer support since  2006. That was mostly written by Radek Doulik from Novell, with fixes  from Redhat's superstar Caolan McNamara. 
     The real question is: Why would StarDivision want to draw  attention to their traditional feature gap, by making noise about  shipping multimedia support four+ years lateÂ ? while simultaneously  alienating valuable contributors and continuing to tear down its  developer community (that would love to help close OO.o's feature gap)Â ?  if that interests you - read on: ..."

#### Weekly Review of the Testing Team by Larry Finger




     "For general news about the openSUSE Testing Core Team, please  see the [minutes](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/04/23/guest-blog-testing-team-minutes-week-16/) and the links within it. 
     The Team held its regular IRC meeting last Monday to report  our experiences with RC2. Of the bugs we have been tracking, many have  been fixed, and we did not find any new ones that could be considered  "show stoppers". From our experiences, it appears that 11.3 will be a  high-quality release. 
     Stephan Kulow has identified the build for the iso images that  are likely to be the official 11.3 release. The NET and DVD images for  i586 and x86_64 architectures have been made available to our Team, and  we will be testing over the weekend. So far, I have installed on an HP  netbook using the NET CD, without finding any important bugs."

     "Power management features for Radeon graphics chips, the first  groundwork for supporting 3D with Evergreen GPUs, H264 decoding in  Intel's Ironlake driver and the support of Intel's next generation of  desktop and notebook chips, are some of the major graphics driver  advancements of Linux 2.6.35." 



#### [h-online/Dj Walker-Morgan: A flood of new, stable, Linux  kernels](http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/A-flood-of-new-stable-Linux-kernels-1033890.html)




     "Greg Kroah-Hartman has released five new stable Linux kernels,  correcting minor errors of their predecessors and including  improvements which are unlikely to generate new errors. As so often with  kernel versions in the stable series, it remains undisclosed if the new  versions contain changes which fix security vulnerabilities, although  the number of changes and some of the descriptions of those changes  certainly suggest that all the new versions contain security fixes. As  usual, Kroah Hartman advised in the release emails, that "All users of  the 2.6.27 kernel series are very strongly encouraged to upgrade to the  new version"; in other release emails, he advises users "should  upgrade"."

### For Desktop Users





#### [openSUSE  TV: Hands on with OpenOffice.org Draw](http://blip.tv/file/1135530)




     "Very good movie who explains the using of ooo's Draw  Application." 



#### [Chema MartÃ­n: KDE Desktop Tricks](http://cristalinux.blogspot.com/2010/07/kde-desktop-tricks.html)




     "I started using KDE when version 4.0 was out. I had had a  taste of KDE 3.5, which I didn't like, but release 4.0 looked like a big  step forward, so I was tempted to give it a go. Just like so many  others, I found KDE 4.0 disappointingly slow, unstable and unintuitive.  However, I did see lots of potential in it and kept using it release  after release." 



### For  Developers and Programmers





#### [Bright Hub/Matthew Casperson: The easy way to make a  useful KDE Plasmoid](http://www.brighthub.com/hubfolio/matthew-casperson/articles/76428.aspx)




     "Plasmoids provide a powerful platform to build up the KDE  desktop, but making a custom Plasmoid does require quite a bit of time  and skill. The good news is that it is easy to build a Plasmoid that  will display a web page, which allows you to take advantage of any  existing web based gadgets." 



### For System Administrators





#### [Bright Hub/Matthew Casperson: Working around a lack of  NTLM / ISA Proxy server support in Linux](http://www.brighthub.com/hubfolio/matthew-casperson/articles/76539.aspx)




     "Microsofts ISA proxy server is popular in many corporations.  Unfortunately support for NTLM authentication is spotty in Linux at  best. This article will show you how to connect to the internet via an  ISA proxy when NTLM is not supported."

    "Maybe some of us knowing a Commandline Tool called "Siga". SIGA  stands for System Information GAthering. It collects various system  information and outputs it in HTML or ASCII format. 
     **Why this is important'**
     It is very handy as an information source during installation  support phone calls. You are experiencing an issue with your  installation of openSuSE and to help technical support analyse the cause  of the problem as fast as possible, you want to assist them by  providing information specific to your system. Through siga you can find  the needed Informations very quick."

#### [Pascal Bleser: openSUSE 11.3RC1 LXDE screencast](http://dev-loki.blogspot.com/2010/07/opensuse-113rc1-lxde-screencast.html)




     "Our good friend and contributor Lee "oldcpu" Matheson did a  nice screencast of the very lightweight LXDE desktop on openSUSE 11.3  RC1. 
     LXDE on openSUSE is quite an interesting undertaking, as it  was completely pushed, driven and implemented by members of our  community, without a single minute being spent on time sponsored by  NovellÂ ;) Andrea Florio did most of the work and lead the charge from  the beginning, so kudos to him as well." 



#### [Pascal Bleser: Even shorter openSUSE repository URLs:  guessing the distro](http://dev-loki.blogspot.com/2010/07/even-shorter-opensuse-repository-urls.html)




     "I updated the documentation about even shorter and more  portable URLs to openSUSE build service repositories. The thing is, the  zypp stack (zypper and YaST2) send the version of the openSUSE it is  running on as an HTTP header when performing an "add repo" operation. 
     That is now used on the server side when a version is not  specifically mentioned in the URL. 
     e.g.: zypper ar -r [http://r.opensu.se/network:utilities.repo](http://r.opensu.se/network:utilities.repo)" 



#### [Dominique Leuenberger: Juniper VPN on openSUSE x86_64](http://dominique.leuenberger.net/blog/?p=120)




     "I™m in the unfortunate situation that my employer uses a  Juniper SSL/VPN solution with network connect capabilities (to initiate a  real tunnel). 
     The solution is built around some Java code, some suid  services and obviously exists as 32bit only. 
     Since the update from v5 to v6.5, network connect does no  longer work when initiated from the web interface, which is a shame. The  issue is a 32bit library that seems no longer to be nicely wrapped and  thus the 64bit java is no longer able to start the processes up. The  worst about all of it: there is no error message, no log file. 
     If you™re lucky enough and you only have username / password  auth, you can simply use ncsvc with some parameters. Of course I am less  fortunate, and besides username/password, we also use a OTP RSA Token.  And of course, ncsvc does not offer any option to enter a 2nd password." 



#### [Cornelius Schumacher: ownCloud in a box](http://blog.cornelius-schumacher.de/2010/07/owncloud-in-box.html)




    "I had some free minutes today at Akademy, so I decided to build  an ownCloud appliance. I did a few iterations in SUSE Studio and there  you go: ownCloud in a box." 



#### [Aaron Bockover: Banshee on Linode](http://abock.org/2010/07/08/banshee-on-linode)




    "I recently migrated all of the Banshee web server stuffs to a  Linode 768. We were previously running on an incredibly slow,  unreliable, and expensive dedicated co-lo machine that once hosted a  number of Novell community projects. As part of the migration, go-oo  (Novell's edition of OpenOffice) has migrated to openSUSE  infrastructure, and I've taken F-Spot with me to Linode. 
     The performance and reliability so far has skyrocketed, and  the flexibility we now have is very welcome. The Banshee web site is  powered by openSUSE 11.2, lighttpd, MySQL, and WordPress. The new Linode  backup service is a huge relief, which we are using in addition to  daily cron-based on-system backups. I've been a huge and loyal fan of  Linode since 2005, and am happy to bring Banshee along!" 



#### [Aaron Bockover: Amazon MP3 downloader support in Banshee](http://abock.org/2010/07/08/amazon-mp3-downloader-support-in-banshee)




    "I'm very excited to announce I have just landed support for  downloading and importing your Amazon MP3 purchases into Banshee. 
     It is a simple extension that understands the download queue  file that Amazon delivers after a purchase is made. Linux Desktop  integration is provided so that your web and file browsers associate  Banshee with the download queue file." 



#### [Uwe Gansert: AutoYaST goes Twitter](http://ugansert.blogspot.com/2010/07/autoyast-goes-twitter.html)




    "well, it's not that it can read XML files from a twitter feed  nowÂ ;) but after this blog, starting from today, AutoYaST goes one  further step to web 2.0 and has it's own twitter account. 
     It's not for great hints or enhanced support or so. It's just a  little look behind the curtain of my life with AutoYaST ... for those  who careÂ ;) 
     And it seems you can't do any bigger project these days  without something like a blog, twitter or facebook or ... so ... here it  is." 



#### [Stephan Kulow: Shortcut for the package download](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/07/09/shortcut-for-the-package-download/)




    "If you look at the list of binaries for a package (e.g.  icecream), you may think that you can download the RPM right away “ but  if you follow the link in a browser you get to see details about the  rpm. 
     Now if you only want to download it, you may already know the  details and don™t care. So I added a little shortcut: if you request the  binary url with a client not accepting html explicitly (e.g. curl,  wget¦), you get the file directly. Just copy & paste the link to  your console and be done. ..." 



#### [Stephen Shaw: iFolder appliance updates](http://feedproxy.google.com/%7Er/decriptor/qXWe/%7E3/GpEbWit-zdA/)




    "Yes, its been forever and then some since I™ve messed with this  stuff.  I™m finally trying to make sure that I get some work done on  this.  The first item of business is the new iFolder appliance project  page being hosted on google code.  This is where I™d like to post  updates, release notes, progress, errata, the how to, fixes,  workarounds, etc. 
     The next thing I want to mention is that I™ve started to work  on an openSUSE 11.2 based iFolder appliance that will include, as of  right now, iFolder 3.8. Â : I™ll be posting links to the test images for  anyone that would like to help test, comment, contribute, etc.  Please  feel free to post bugs to the project page and I™ll do my best to fix  them."

     "Every now and then, I receive emails from people who are  asking me to explain the benefits or advantages of using Linux. I just  answered them with a link or two to articles that could give a good  explanation regarding the subject matter.

Whether you hate or love Firefox itself, the  extensions are what usually turn the tide as to whether it is used, and  Firefox has some great extensions that really enhance the Web browsing  experience. I wanted to share a few of my favorite Firefox extensions,  so here goes."

     "The latest version of openSUSE hit final code last week and is  not due for official release until July 15, but The Reg is here to give  you a tour of its pros and cons. 
     The free operating system has been somewhat maligned for its  association with Novell, the Linux company that partnered with Microsoft  and is now touting itself for sale, so it's perhaps unsurprising that  the release comes on the heels of a new mission statement that seeks to  create a bit of distance between openSUSE and Novell's commercial  projects." 



#### [Linux Magazine/Joe Brockmeier: Firefox 4 Beta Brings  Speed Boost](http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7822/)




     "Firefox has been taking heat from Google Chrome over speed for  some time, but the world™s most popular open source browser is getting  ready for a comeback. Can Firefox 4.0 woo back some of the early  adopters who™ve embraced Chrome? It looks like it will have a very good  shot."
