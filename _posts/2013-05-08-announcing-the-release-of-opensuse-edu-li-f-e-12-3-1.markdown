Li-f-e incorporates the latest stable versions of all popular desktop environments such as [KDE](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:KDE), [Gnome](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:GNOME) and [Cinnamon.](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GNOME_Cinnamon) It includes wide range of software catering to everyone's needs from the openSUSE [Education repository](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Education/), multimedia from the [Packman](http://packman.links2linux.org/) repository, development tools, and [KIWI-LTSP](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:LTSP_quick_start_12.2_Edu) -that allows normal PCs or diskless thin clients to network boot from a server running Li-f-e and lot more.

Since this edition is based on openSUSE 12.3, all the official 12.3 updates, repositories from build service and [Packman](http://packman.links2linux.org/) can be used to install additional software and keep it udpated.

Minimum hardware requirement are 1GB of RAM and 15GB free disk space. Installation from a USB stick will take about 40 minutes to complete depending on hardware capabilities. From a DVD it takes much longer. Check [this howto](//lizards.opensuse.org/2012/09/13/live-fat-stick/) for creating live USB stick on vfat partition or other [GUI and terminal ways](http://en.opensuse.org/Live_USB_stick).

Here is the sample of some of the [software available on the iso](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e). A complete list of packages with version numbers is listed [here](http://www.opensuse-education.org/%7Ecyberorg/opensuse-edu-life-1231-packages.html).

This time, we also have an [openSUSE Edu Li-f-e 12.3 64bit](http://susestudio.com/search?q=opensuse-edu) version in [SUSE Studio](http://susestudio.com/) - if you want to give it a try, download the ISO image or log in and run the image via "Testdrive" in your local browser! (Please note that 64bit edition has not been through a rigorous QA.)

Test reports are always welcomed - if you encounter any problems, feel free to contact us via any way mentioned in our [wiki](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Education) or write a [bug report](https://bugzilla.novell.com/enter_bug.cgi?classification=7340&product=openSUSE.org&component=3rd%20party%20software&assigned_to=lrupp%40suse.com&short_desc=Education).
