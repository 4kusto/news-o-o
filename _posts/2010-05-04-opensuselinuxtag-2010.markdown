## Booth Setup


[![](/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/original_img_2454.jpeg)](/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/original_img_2454.jpeg)
We are currently working on a Booth setup which includes a showroom of the latest developments in our beloved distribution which will be around release candidate one (RC1) during that time and we plan to release and show the next generation Build Service. The booth will also feature hack sessions for contributors, or people who want to become one, lead by the [openSUSE Boosters](http://en.opensuse.org/Boosters_Team). In these up and close hack sessions, with a small number of participants, a Booster will teach you all about a way to contribute to openSUSE and/or open source in general.  Topics include _hacking your first plasmoid_, _rolling your first package in the build service_, _fixing your first openSUSE bug_ or _building your first distribution with KIWI_.

So grab your laptop and make yourself ready to [go to Berlin](http://www.linuxtag.org/2010/en/visitors/travel-information.html)! Oh and if you are interested in helping to plan or man our booth, have ideas for a hack-session we could do or in general want to get in touch with us about LinuxTag don't miss the [openSUSE Project Meetings](http://en.opensuse.org/Meetings/Project) every other Wednesday on IRC. Looking forward to see you there.
