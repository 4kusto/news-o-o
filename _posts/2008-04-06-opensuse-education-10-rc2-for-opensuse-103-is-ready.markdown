With RC2 for openSUSE 10.3 the [openSUSE-Education project](http://www.opensuse-education.org/) starts the last testing phase before we release the final version of openSUSE-Education 1.0 for openSUSE 10.3. At this point, the only things left for the release is fixing possible bugs in the current packages and working on the documentation.




### Recent Changes




In contrast to the normal release work-flow, we updated many packages and even added new ones to the media. Below is an _incomplete_ list of changes with this release:

### Media and Download




As a result of the size, we decided to ship three ISO images instead of one:






  * openSUSE-Education-1.0-for-10.3-i386-RC2.iso => for (normal) 32bit PCs


  * openSUSE-Education-1.0-for-10.3-x86_64-RC2.iso => for 64bit PCs


  * openSUSE-Education-1.0-for-10.3-SOURCES-RC2.iso => contains the source RPMs (if you don't know what this means, you don't need it ;-) )




You can find the ISO images in our [download directory](http://www.opensuse-education.org/download/ISOs/) and also on the [SUSE FTP server](ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/education/). But you can also add our [online repository](http://www.opensuse-education.org/download/repo/1.0/10.3/) as add-on source via the YaST2 Add-on Module.  Just use the URL:
