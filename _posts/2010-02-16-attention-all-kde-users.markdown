KDE SC 4.3.5 is about to become available for openSUSE 11.2 as an online update (from 4.3.1).  This release fixes many bugs, so we decided to push it as an online update instead of making it an optional update in the Build Service, and by fixing bugs we give our KDE contributors more time to work for openSUSE 11.3.

This makes the Build Service KDE:43 repository redundant, so it is being removed.  KDE:43 users should remove this repository from their installation sources.

For more details and information on how to use other KDE versions on all supported openSUSE editions, see [KDE Repositories](http://en.opensuse.org/KDE/Repositories).

_Edit:_ KDE 4.3 users on older versions of openSUSE are not being left out in the rain.Â  [KDE:KDE4:STABLE:Desktop](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/KDE:/KDE4:/STABLE:/Desktop) contains the same KDE SC 4.3.5 that was added to openSUSE 11.2.
