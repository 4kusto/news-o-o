![](/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/cookie.png)Members of the openSUSE will host a 3D Design and Printing Workshop in Nuremberg on Sept. 10 from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m at SUSE Headquarter.

The workshop, which as 60 spots available, will focus on teaching attendees on how to design and print 3D objects with open source tools like InkScape (easy enough for Kids) and FreeCAD.

"We will have a lot of fun at this workshop," said Adrian Schroeter, an openSUSE member. "No matter the attendees experience of 3D design and printing, this workshop will give them the tools to make something and be creative. Plus, everybody gets the chance to take their own piece in printed form home."

Those who are interested Â are encouraged to attend the workshop that will teach both beginner and advanced level designing. Kids accompanied by an adult are welcomed to attend.

Attendees will learn about further tools needed for 3D printing and should come with a 3D model or STereoLithography file to modify. Attendees can find existing models at[ http://www.thingiverse.com](http://www.thingiverse.com).

There will be two[ LulzBot](https://www.lulzbot.com/) 3D Printers that were supplied by[ AlephObjects](https://www.alephobjects.com/) that people will be able to use for printing their projects.

Attendees should come with a laptop and have an openSUSE distribution installed or could also use [openSUSE Leap](https://software.opensuse.org/) from the [Microsoft store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/opensuse-leap-42/9njvjts82tjx) . A list of tools for 3D design and printing can be found at[ https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Science_Mechanical_engineering](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Science_Mechanical_engineering).

The workshop will try to support both German or English languages.
