Our community portal, reachable via https://connect.opensuse.org/, accompanied our community now 
since 2010. A long, long time. Especially, if you compare it with Facebook (which started in 2006) or 
LinkedIn (who became an international company in 2010). 

While Facebook and LinkedIn are meanwhile multi-billion dollar markets, our community portal is meanwhile 
mainly used to organize the openSUSE members and being a "contact point" for members, who provide their 
profiles to help others to contact them.

Over 20,000 actively registered users and 100 groups might give an idea about the diversity and agility 
of the openSUSE community. From art to musicians over to local user groups and groups for all the different 
window managers and their lovers. Everyone found a place here in the openSUSE universe.

But time flies by quickly - and especially the technology sector never stands still. Today, we need to announce 
the final shut down of our community portal. The reason is simple: while we asked multiple times for help and 
someone who wants to actively maintain and administrate the service, nobody stepped up. As we can not secure the 
application any longer without big time investments, we decided to shut it down and let it rest in peace instead. 

By doing this, we apologize for the trouble that this decision might cause to some people. We tried our 
best to support you over all the years by running the service as long as possible. But if nobody steps up and 
want to take over the work any longer, it's better to say 'good bye' instead to wait until the Hackers of the world
share the data of our users. 

An era comes to an end. A nice one, indeed. But it also means that there might be a new era at the horizon. 
Some new tools, that have a maintainer and someone who takes care. 

Look at our [Forums](https://forums.opensuse.org/), our [Wikis](https://en.opensuse.org/), [Mailing Lists](https://lists.opensuse.org/) 
or the new [Matrix](https://chat.opensuse.org/) service. We will not stop to support you, we will do our best 
to keep you and your data secure. 

Remember to have a lot of fun!

Lars - in the name of the openSUSE heroes -
