Cornelius has [posted the  final draft](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2007-08/msg00010.html) of the openSUSE Guiding Principles to the [opensuse-project](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/) mailing list. The openSUSE Guiding Principles are addressing the openSUSE community and outside world by providing documentation of the common understanding how the project works. The project is now working on getting broad support from inside Novell as well as the external openSUSE community for the final version of the Guiding Principles and will then officially announce them.
