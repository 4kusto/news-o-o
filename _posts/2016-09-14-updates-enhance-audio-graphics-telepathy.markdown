![hexageeko](/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hexageeko.png)Snapshots this week added new sensations for [Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Tumbleweed_installation) users, but there were plenty of other updates in the repositories to get people excited.

While snapshot [20160907](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-09/msg00193.html) added some subpackages to enhance PulseAudio and updated [telepathy-qt5](https://telepathy.freedesktop.org/wiki/) to version 0.9.7, [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/download/) fixed quite a few bugs in its update to version 1.8.3 to improve media processing. Wine’s 32-bit subpackage update in the snapshot, bringing it to version 1.9.18, added support for multiple kernel drivers in a single process.

Snapshot [20160908](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-09/msg00218.html) offered some updates for yast2-network, -kdump and -user. The snapshot also featured updates for [hexchat](https://hexchat.github.io/), libstorage and python-keyring to version 9.3.1.

Mesa’s update to version 12.0.2 in the [20160909](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-09/msg00237.html) snapshot improved imagery as well as driver crashes. An update to [doxygen 1.8.12](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/changelog.html), which helps generate documentation from annotated C sources, showed several bug fixes in its [changelog](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/changelog.html) and [glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/) updated to version 2.24 in the [20160909](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-09/msg00237.html) snapshot.

Academic, researchers, and high-performance computer users will be happy to see a new version of [openmpi](http://www.open-mpi.de/) in the [snapshot](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-09/msg00237.html), which provides several upstream bug fixes, improvements and documentation updates in version 1.10.3.

Systemd provided a small fix in snapshot [20160911](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-09/msg00252.html) and Tumbleweed is now on the same upstream version of [wayland-protocols](https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/wayland-devel/2016-August/030606.html) with version 1.7. [Gawk](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2016-08/msg00013.html), the AWK programming language, which provides more recent Bell Laboratories _awk_ extensions, and a number of GNU-specific extensions, updated to version 4.1.4 in the [20160911](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-09/msg00252.html) snapshot.

[GNOME 3.22](https://wiki.gnome.org/ThreePointTwentyone/ReleaseNotes) has yet to make it into a Tumbleweed snapshot. It has some new testing issues and is still working its way through staged testing.
