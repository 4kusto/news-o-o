We opened registration back in [February](https://news.opensuse.org/2013/02/20/osc13-cfp/) and now we've just passed the mark of two weeks from the conference! If you have not yet registered, please hurry up: we need these numbers to plan for the event. You have until end of day tomorrow (Friday the 5th of July) to finish your registration! If you did plan on going but had to cancel, we'd appreciate it if you would make sure this is reflected in your registration status.


## Be nice, help us out by registering!


Attending the openSUSE Conference is entirely free of charge, thanks to our [generous sponsors](https://news.opensuse.org/2013/07/01/thanking-the-opensuse-conference-sponsors-2/) but please respect our work and put in the little effort to register. It helps make our work easy - and that work is plenty. We won't say no to anybody - registration is greatly appreciated but penalty for not doing so doesn't include anything like torture. However, you might not be able to secure yourself a place at one of the social events and even the conference lunch could become problematic.

Please note that registering for an account and actually registering for the openSUSE Conference 2013 event are _two distinct steps_!

We'd also like to remind you that it is possible to support our event by purchasing supporter tickets ($50) or professional tickets ($250) during registration. Funds from these ticket sales are a very important part of the budget for the overall conference. The money is used to fund the event and help with the _openSUSE Travel Support Program_ to allow as many contributors as possible to attend the event. You can also get them in the SUSE Shop:



	
  * North America, Latin America and Asian Pacific: [Supporter ticket](https://buy.suse.com/store/suse/en_US/buy/productID.264835100), [Professional ticket](https://buy.suse.com/store/suse/en_US/buy/productID.264935300).

	
  * Europe, Middle East and Africa: [Supporter ticket](http://shop.novell.com/DRHM/store?Action=AddItemToRequisition&siteId=novelleu&Env=BASE&productId=265352500) and [Professional ticket](http://shop.novell.com/DRHM/store?Action=AddItemToRequisition&siteId=novelleu&Env=BASE&productId=265352400).


As supporter or professional ticket holders you will receive a special thank you surprise upon check-in.


## Last minute!


We've got a few things for you to keep an eye on when joining us.




	
    * As you might have seen in the [announcement of the schedule](https://news.opensuse.org/?p=16204) yesterday, we're recording the main tracks of the event and there will also be plenty of people with camera's. This is a open and public event and while we try to respect your privacy as much as reasonable, we can not in any way guarantee that you won't get digitized and end up on the web. This does indeed mean that [Obama can see you](http://obamaischeckingyouremail.tumblr.com/). Sorry.

	
    * Being in a public place does also mean you'll have to behave at your best. We'd like to remind you of our [Code of Conduct](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_code_of_conduct). In short: "We, as a community, value and respect people of all stripes - genders, orientations, races, abilities, shapes and sizes - and _will not tolerate vilification, abuse or harassment in any form_." Note that this often requires you to be a tad more polite than you might be among friends at home: we're an international community and with that come additional opportunities for misunderstandings. Bonus is that being [smiling](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=smile-it-could-make-you-happier) and [being nice](http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/kindness_makes_you_happy_and_happiness_makes_you_kind) makes you happy, so it is no wasted effort!



We'll be counting on the folks who have registered - and if you plan on coming but didn't yet, you have until end-of-day tomorrow to add yourself!
