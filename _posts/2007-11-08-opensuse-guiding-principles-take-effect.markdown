It's official: the openSUSE project [Guiding Principles](http://en.opensuse.org/Guiding_Principles) are now in force. The Guiding Principles are a framework for the project and give everyone a clear view of who we are, what we stand for, what the project wants and how it works. The Guiding Principles document was created by the openSUSE community and is embraced by Novell - the founder and largest sponsor of the openSUSE project. This important document will help ensure the success and continued progress of the project. Along with the Guiding Principles, we are also launching the openSUSE Board to offer a central point of contact to the community and make community participation in project governance easier. The [ openSUSE Board ](http://en.opensuse.org/Board) consists of both external community members and community members employed by Novell . 

We encourage all to support the Guiding Principles [ here](https://users.opensuse.org/ ). Create your profile and support the Guiding Principles. 

We want to especially thank all contributors to the Guiding Principles, and last but not least, all community members who make the openSUSE project such a success. 

Have a lot of fun!
