[openSUSE participates in the Google Summer of Code 2011](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/02/22/opensuse-participates-in-the-google-summer-of-code-2011/)







### Note


**This Article is Licensed under the [GNU Free Documentation
License.](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.txt)**




In about a week Google will accept applications from Free Software projects to be part of
Googleâ€™s Summer of Code. This great project enables students who want to spend their summer
time working on Free Software instead of a regular summer job the opportunity to do. Commonly
called GSOC, the program helps students by paying them cash for their code. A successful
project makes the student about USD 5000 which certainly is not bad for a summer job.

The students get mentored and the project itself receives another donation of USD500 per
successful student project. Of course GSOC is not just about the money: it is about learning
and making a difference for the students; it is about having fun and learning for the mentors
too; and the project often gains valuable new contributors!

**Why and for whom?**

GSOC has shown to be successful in its goal of bringing new contributors to Free Software.
Over the years many students continued to be involved in the projects they have participated
in through GSOC. If you are a student and want to contribute and even make a career in Free
Software we definitely advice you to think about being part of a GSOC program.

But also if you are already an openSUSE contributor and you would love an opportunity to
spend 8 weeks full time on your favorite project, this is for you! Many great applications and
initiatives have been started as GSOC programs in the past like Cheese and Empathy. Many
students who started with Free Software thanks to GSOC have been able to turn it into a great
career, all that while having fun.

openSUSE has unfortunately not been able to participate in GSOC last year. This year we do
want to do better and for that we need help. We need people from our community to step up and
be mentors, we need ideas for students to execute and of course we need students to submit
proposals!

Women, donâ€™t forget you are very welcome to be part of openSUSE. We are a community which
embraces diversity. We want everyone to have fun, no matter your, skill level, gender, race,
cultural background or where youâ€™re from. Everyone deserves an opportunity like this, so join
us!

**Information **

You can find openSUSEâ€™s [wiki
page](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GSOC_2011) on GSOC 2011 here and our [list of ideas here](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GSOC_2011_Ideas). Many
people have already submitted ideas but more are very welcome.

[SUSE
Studio/James Tan: Public openSUSE 11.3 AMIs](http://blog.susestudio.com/2011/02/public-opensuse-113-amis.html)







### Note


**This Article is owned by Novell Inc. [http://www.novell.com/company/legal/](http://www.novell.com/company/legal/)**




"We've been receiving a lot of very positive feedback since we [added Amazon EC2
support](http://blog.susestudio.com/2010/10/new-amazon-ec2-build-format.html) in SUSE Studio, so I'd just like to take a moment to thank everyone
for their support!

Feature requests keep coming in, but one in particular stands out due to its popularity
-- the ability to create openSUSE [EBS](http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/)
[AMIs](http://aws.amazon.com/amis). This is especially useful as
Amazon's [free usage tier](http://aws.amazon.com/free/) does not
support instance-store backed AMIs (which we already support in Studio for openSUSE).

So after some nudging from one of our users, Thomps, I did some hacking over the weekend
and added openSUSE EBS support in the create_ebs_ami.sh script (which is by the way,
open-source and [available on
Github](https://github.com/jamestyj/susestudio-ec2)). This will be merged into Studio soon.

While working on this, I noticed that there aren't any official public openSUSE
AMIs out there, so I created some with SUSE Studio ([32 bit](http://susegallery.com/a/n0rKOx/opensuse-113-ami--2), [64 bit](http://susegallery.com/a/n0rKOx/opensuse-113-ami)). The full list of
public openSUSE 11.3 AMIs are listed in the table below." (...)

[Brandon Philips:
Build Service Action Menu UI](http://ifup.org/2011/02/24/build-service-action-menu-ui/)


[Last
week](http://ifup.org/2011/02/17/fixing-open-build-service-ui-gripes/) I wrote a few patches to improve the UI of the build service. The first of
these patches were accepted but the removal of the Actions menu wasn't as well liked.
This was the proposal:

**Current Interface**

The current javascript pop out menu is hard to discover and not really necessary given
how much space is available in the UI.


![](http://ifup.org/images/obs-project-before.png)


**My Suggested Patch**

OBS has other horizontal controls and the vertical space to handle an inline list so I
submitted this layout in my patches.


![](http://ifup.org/images/obs/control-horizontal.png)


However, in the merge request [Sascha
suggested](http://gitorious.org/opensuse/build-service/merge_requests/9) an alternative which I have tried out and taken screenshots of below
(ignore the margin issues, I need to fix the css for the bento showleft class which breaks
the 960 grid layout).

**Sascha's Suggestion**

What I don't like about this is that if you visit a project or package with a
long description the really useful information about failures and the controls are below
the fold and a scroll wheel away.


![](http://ifup.org/images/obs/control-bottom.png)


**Controls on Top **

I could move the controls to the top above the description but this feels like it
takes up a lot of space.


![](http://ifup.org/images/obs/control-top.png)


What do people think? I still feel like the horizontal layout is the best option but
some more feedback would be helpful.

[Sankar P: Introducing GOSC - A Graphical client for openSUSE Build Service](http://psankar.blogspot.com/2011/02/introducing-gosc-graphical-client-for.html)


"openSUSE buildservice is an awesome framework for building rpms for multiple
distributions. It is used by the openSUSE project, the Meego project, VLC, all distro
releases from Novell, and in many other places. Usually OBS is accessed by a browser, I
have implemented a simple GUI tool for working with OBS servers.

If you are extremely busy, just proceed to the screenshots section and the [github](https://github.com/curiosity/gosc) tree. Otherwise, read
below:

**History**






	
  1. A few days back, sragavan, ravim85 and I were chatting on twitter that the new
(2.0) interface of OBS takes too much of clicks and too many page navigations for
simple operations (compared to older interface). I felt that it will be better if I
could get the build information about all my projects in a single page and also
allowing me to easily see the build logs of various packages.

	
  2. I have always wanted to learn python. I have given some small level python
patches for some projects. But haven't had any experience in writing a python
project from the scratch.

	
  3. Today (yesterday to be precise) I had an annoying meeting that drained me
mentally and ended up with some frustration. I wanted to get rid of the bad
mood.





Based on the above three factors, I decided to complete a project that I just started
day before yesterday (with a simple Python HelloWorld) into an usable thick-client for
openSUSE build service. The result is GOSC and the code is already in [github](https://github.com/curiosity/gosc).

**OSC commandline & OBS Library **

I wanted to use a library for talking with the OBS APIs from my GUI client. But darix
confirmed my fear in IRC that no such library exists as of now. One option was to copy
paste code from the osc commandline client's sources. But this is ugly and will give
maintenance nightmares. So, I decided to just use "osc" from my python programs
and create a GUI wrapper using Python.

**yabsc **

Srinidhi told me of a different client for build-service named yabsc. I looked into
it. It was written in true KDE fashion, exposing every possible control to the user. It
lists all the projects building in the entire build-service and not just "My
Projects". Also, I felt it is a little keyboard unfriendly and had too many tabs. So
I ditched it as it was not meeting my usability requirements. However, if you are a
looking for a more powerful, more matured product and not scared by too many controls on
screen, it is better if you try yabsc.





FigureÂ 1.Â Initial screen. "My Projects" are shown in the top-left listview.







![Initial screen. "My Projects" are shown in the top-left listview.](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Vkr7vCDvK38/TV2I3-bO6OI/AAAAAAAAEXE/iPflQfJFE6U/s320/gosc-main-screen.png)








  






FigureÂ 2.Â Double-clicking a project from the list, will list the packages in the project in
the adjacent listview. The buildresults of the project are shown in the bottom
textarea.

chooser dialog.

The source is licensed under LGPLv2.1. There are a lot of small fixes that could still
be added, like a "Loading..." status bar for network operations, Caching of
buildlogs, project names, subscribing to build notifications from the build-server etc.
But they are not part of my regular workflow and also I strongly believe in "Release
Early Release Often". So, I am releasing in this barebones version, which already
seem to solve my workflow needs.

During the implementation of this, I learned a lot about python. This experience also
**strengthened** my old opinion that **Compiled languages are better for large scale projects**.

Your feedback, comments and patches are very much welcome. "

[Nelson
Marques: Indicators for GNOME2 â€“ Update](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/02/19/indicators-for-gnome2-update/)







### Note


**This Article is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation
License.**




"Canonical has been very active and released quite an impressive amount of bug
fixes and features for their Ayatana Project software. Iâ€™ve been doing the updates, sent a
couple of tiny patches upstream (mainly packaging issues) and with the RC1, I am very
happy with the results accomplished.

Regarding this project, Iâ€™ve seen news, blog posts and lots of feedback from several
distribution users. Iâ€™ve found contents in German, Portuguese (Brazilian Portuguese),
English, Russian and Spanish. For the most I believe everyone is happy this is happening.

During the next week, Iâ€™m going to conduct an open-beta for the GNOME2 indicators from
which I hope to get some feedback and improve things so that once openSUSE 11.4 is
release, those users willing to use this software can do it safely, and off course in an
openSUSE way, a rock solid and featured GNOME experience.

Iâ€™ve created a pattern which will duplicated in the GNOME:Ayatana repository named
â€˜gnome2-indicatorsâ€™ which will install the 5 base indicators on Ubuntu Natty. About this
indicators and some previous comments that Iâ€™ve seen online, I would like to clarify a
couple of things:






	
  * All the software is built on top of â€˜openSUSE stackâ€™, so weâ€™re not really
converting Ubuntu to RPMâ€™s.

	
  * The patch level applied from Ubuntu is minimum, only the mandatory feature
patches were applied on pure openSUSE stack. Some of this features werenâ€™t
upstreamed, while others were turned down, so GNOME:Ayatana will also provide the
modified software required, this is the case of GTK+ (2.0) which is properly tested
and no issues were found against the regular GTK+ stack on 11.4.

	
  * Iâ€™ve patched and built applications like Metacity, Empathy and gnome-session to
enable functionality with the Indicators. Iâ€™m also serving this patched versions
through GNOME:Ayatana, without them, there wouldnâ€™t really be a pleasant indicator
experience for openSUSE users. I would love to see community contributions to
GNOME:Ayatana for all of those that arenâ€™t available yet. Donâ€™t be shy, we donâ€™t
bite! (A big plus is that you can actually learn a lot, and the openSUSE GNOME Team
is very friendly and helpful. If you really want to help and improve yourself, step
forward!.





Now for realâ€¦ what does the GNOME2 Indicator pattern offers?






	
  1. A 99% working Session Indicator, from where users can perform several session
related tasks (ex: logout, restart, switch users, hibernate, etc). The only feature
I know itâ€™s not present is the â€œrestart/relogâ€ option after software updates. If
anyone want to work this indicator to work with PackageKit / YaST or zypper, would
be probably a big plus and significative contribution to openSUSE and
upstream.

	
  2. The ME Menu, which appears to be fully functional.

	
  3. A simple clock indicator. This indicator is under very active development, and
displays a simple calendar/clock with options to manage appointments (through
Evolution). The â€˜date/timeâ€™ configurations are disabled because on openSUSE we use
YaST for it. Except for this, everything seems to be working.

	
  4. Sound Menu indicatorâ€¦ the (in)famous Sound indicator from Ubuntu, which displays
an horizontal slide bar for sound volume management and fully integrates with
Banshee. Since Iâ€™m recent convert to Banshee from Totem because of the development
of this project, Iâ€™ve also packaged and made available from GNOME:Ayatana two extensions:




	
    * banshee-extension-soundmenu â€“ Enables integration with soundmenu, really a
plus/must if Banshee is your preferred multimedia player;

	
    * banshee-extension-indicator â€“ A Banshee indicator. Iâ€™ve only really
packaged this because it offers integration with Notify OSD, the indicator
itself is less featured than the traditional gnome extension.





	
  5. The Messaging Menu â€“ Another controversial indicatorâ€¦ Currently itâ€™s working
with Empathy (patched with libindicate on GNOME:Ayatana), xchat, evolution and
gwibber. Other applications like pidgin are known to work up to a certain point.
This indicator grabs any incoming messaging and alerts the user for it. Itâ€™s not
really that bad once you get used to it (takes a couple of hours).





Additionally to this, Notify OSD is also available for openSUSE 11.4, and doesnâ€™t
require any extra repository. openSUSE 11.4 ships with a version of Notify OSD that allows
the user to skin/theme it in several ways. This behavior isnâ€™t enabled on Ubuntu and
relies on a patched refused by upstream by Roman Sokuchev. The development project for
this package is GNOME:Apps, and my thanks to Vincent Untz and Dominique L. for helping
with the process.

During next week, GNOME:Ayatana will be populated and a free open BETA will be start
to gather feedback amongst our users.

A side noteâ€¦ Yesterday an update for Sound Menu was issued by Canonical and it deeply
relies on libnotify >= 0.7.0. openSUSE 11.4 will ship with libnotify 0.6.0 and
therefore Iâ€™m not committing more changes to Sound Menu and will only fix critical issues
if found for this package.

After openSUSE 11.4 is released, Iâ€™ll start working on implementing this for GNOME3,
and hopefully now I will have enough time to try to push them to Factory for openSUSE 12
(or whatever it will be called).

Contributions are accepted in any area not covered by me, or fixing stuff, and also
very important, in the KDE field. About Unityâ€¦ hereâ€™s a riddle: â€œHow can you tell if a
ghost is about to faint?â€."

"Dear all, While Iâ€™ve worked on the GNOME:Ayatana project page in English,
Raul, a dedicated contributor from Brazil has provided the Portuguese version of this
page. I would like to express my gratitude to Raul for a well done job, and Iâ€™m happy that
someone from Brazil stepped up for this task, as I assume that this project will have far
more visibility in Brazil than in Portugal itself.

If anyone wants to translate the page and keep it update for any other languages, that
would be awesome! Please let me know, so that I can add your name into the contributors
for this Project, or eventually you can do it yourself, this is a community project, so,
you donâ€™t actually need my permission to improve contents, I encourage such behavior!
Thanks Raul.

[Nelson Marques: Default Wallpaper for GNOME:Ayatana](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/02/21/default-wallpaper-for-gnomeayatana/)







### Note


**This Article is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation

Not that I know a lot about Artwork or Wallpapersâ€¦ For those, I am mainly a
â€˜customerâ€™ most of the times, and things get easy forâ€¦ either I like it, or I donâ€™t.
Thereâ€™s a lot of stuff available out there, and initially I loved the snake (I still do),
but since I couldnâ€™t distribute it due to licensing, Iâ€™ve spent a couple of hours looking
for Artwork with a compatible license and contacted a few artists about licensing and the
possibility of using/distributing their work.

To distribute for GNOME:Ayatana on the 11.4 cycle, Iâ€™m going to use â€˜Spaceman Goldrush
Editionâ€™ from â€˜mydarktimeâ€™, a German artist. Iâ€™m happy that mydarktime has been so kind in
allowing openSUSE to distribute this package under CC-BY-SA. I will also take the
opportunity to quote him:

â€œ(â€¦) I would be very pleased to see mine in itâ€ (wallpaper pack on GNOME:Ayatana).

I find this wallpaper very attractive and it doesnâ€™t really tire me up from looking at
it, which is really, really nice! I hope everyone else likes it also!

reading
http://fedoramagazine.wordpress.com/2008/10/21/interview-fedora-10s-better-startup/
really makes me think we should go this way.

Ray's comment starting with "Every flicker and mode change in the boot
process takes away from the whole experience." is especially interesting. Is it
okay to track the "don't show grub by default" here?"

"in yum it is possible to enable a repository only for one instance.

eg.

yum --enable development install rhythmbox

will install rhythmbox from disabled repo development.

yum --disable repo fedora install x

will install package x from other repo, which packages have less priority than
fedora's packages and the fedora's packages are preffered by yum.

per-instance repo management is good idea, esp. if you're not willing to
permanently update your whole system to factory, but eg. update single
firefox."

â€œ


[zypper lr --active - list only active
repos](https://features.opensuse.org/311336)


"I often find myself to run

zypper lr | grep 'Yes *|'

to get a list of all active repos on my system. A zypper option would be useful for
this - something like

zypper lr --active

(not sure about the short version of this option, because the obvious ones (-a, -A)
are already taken.)"

[YaST debconf Module](https://features.opensuse.org/311338)


"Currently, people installing RPM packages have no opportunity to configure the
installed applications afterwards with openSUSE Tools - if there's no specialized
YaST module. This is a disadvantage comparing to Debians debconf system, allowing
packagers (and therefor endusers) asking the user certain configuration questions after
installation. (...)"

â€œ


[service enable framework](https://features.opensuse.org/311339)


"The chkconfig tool on openSUSE handles enabling and disabling of sysv init
scripts and [x]inetd services.

e.g.

chkconfig apache2 on

chkconfig vsftpd inetd

This convenience allows us to ship services disabled by default. So installation of
packages doesn't automatically cause more running daemons or exposed network
services. There are many other kinds of services though so the framework should be
extended to handle them as well:

- systemd units

- dbus services

- apache modules

- [list more here]

Ideally the services should be managed by symlinks like sysv init scripts so no
.rpmnew files hurt distro upgrades."

"More and more laptops, netbooks, pc's, servers, actually anything with
some kind of storage need is equipped with Solid State Disks.

Although at first glance they may seem quite similar to harddisks, they really are a
completely different species with some very different characteristics.

It might be convenient for having an "SSD Best practise enabler" switch
when creating partitions on disks in Yast, which would then automatically setup the
features (and possibly others) mentioned in the "Why do we want this" part of
this feature."

I therefore suggest considering the addition of gnome-schedule

[As announced previously](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/02/16/open-bugs-day-on-sunday-the-20th-of-february/), openSUSE organized an Open-Bugs-Day held on January
20. Many people participated, including a large number of contributors new to [#opensuse-testing](irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-testing) on [Freenode servers](http://freenode.net/)!

**Results **

Bernhard Wiedemann created a nice tool at [openbugs.zq1.de](http://openbugs.zq1.de/) to avoid the situation where two people work on the same issue.
There were VMâ€™s prepared with VNC access so people could easily test and someone in the
team ran his first KVM Virtual Machine at home, thanks to the help of the rest of the
team. Another participant filed his first bug on bugzilla (that would be bug number [673629](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=673629)). In the end,
the team went through and updated 60% of all old 11.4 bugs (=132 of 219)!

And of course, they had a lot of funâ€¦

Finally, we have some crude statistics about yesterdayâ€™s most active participants, who
can get the geeko-gear reward (just send your details to [Bernhard Wiedermann](http://en.opensuse.org/User:Bmwiedemann))!

This list is generated with a perl script | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r | head -11

Congrats on the great work!

**Future **

The team decided it would be nice to have such events on a regular basis, so
2011-04-02 is proposed for the next Open-Bugs-Day.

The Idea of this Festival is spread the knowledge about Open Source in general and Linux
in particular by installing it on the participants machines. I has been participating for
the las 4 years by helping with talks, openSUSE DVDs, etc.

The [FLISOL 2011](http://www.installfest.net/) will be celebrated the
next April 9. If you live in Latin America of will be in some of the countries that
celebrates FLISOL, [you can check
where and at what time will be celebrated in the city that you will be](http://www.installfest.net/FLISOL2011/Ciudades). Always is
good to hangout with other people that wants to get to know about openSUSE and the Open
Source in General.

This Time I will be participating in [Mexico City](http://www.installfest.net/FLISOL2011/Mexico/DistritoFederal?highlight=(%5CbCategoryCity%5Cb)) in about 3 different places with talks and giving away openSUSE DVDs

### Note


**This Article is: Copyright Â© 2011 Heise Media UK Ltd. The openSUSE
Weekly News Team has a special Permission to introduce Articles from
h-online.com.**




"**Kernel version 38 will offer a new meshing implementation, loads of
new and improved LAN and Wi-Fi drivers, plus various minor changes that promise to improve
the network subsystem's performance.**

All the parts in this Kernel Log mini-series can be found by referring to [the
2.6.38 tracking page](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Linux-Kernel-2-6-38-Tracking-1193254.html).

Early on the morning of 22 February, Linus Torvalds [issued](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1103561) the sixth release
candidate of Linux 2.6.38. In his release email, Torvalds mentioned a fix for a memory
corruption problem â€“ but he said that it is rare and only two people ever saw it. There was no
indication of a final release date for 2.6.38. Usually released on a weekly basis, the
"regression reports" have recently listed [17 unsolved problems](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.acpi.devel/49465)
which don't exist in 2.6.37; a further [26 flaws](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.network/186887) introduced between
2.6.36 and 2.6.37 also remain unsolved.

The Kernel Log takes the release of RC6 as an opportunity to continue its "Coming in
2.6.38" mini series and describe the advancements in terms of network hardware drivers and
infrastructure. [The first part of our mini series](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-2-6-38-Part-1-Graphics-1176900.html) described the changes in the graphics hardware
area, while the [second part](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-2-6-38-Part-2-File-systems-1192694.html) covered file systems. Over the coming weeks, further articles will
discuss the kernel's storage, architecture and infrastructure code as well as its audio, USB,
and video hardware drivers. (...)

years old. And it shows. It is important to understand that this is a Unix command and
behaves in â€œUnix wayâ€. For example, it uses IFS (Input Field Separators) to determine where
to split fields. You can check it with set | grep IFS. You can also set it, for example, to:

"**Preambule : free
software**

**Warning
**

I would notice everybody which will install these software : you will install
proprietary softwares on your computer. Nobody will be able to debug them, nor help you to
resolve what can be happen. That must be said !

**The free future **

The real future is already in place : itâ€™s called radeon (or free-radeon), itâ€™s fully
integrated in kernel & xorg. Actually ( for openSUSE 11.4, or openSUSE 11.3 with [kernel-stable](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Kernel:/stable/openSUSE_11.3/) + [X11 obs
repo](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:/XOrg/openSUSE_11.3/) ). Support for many chipset is in real progress even for the 6xxx series.
Give it a try before using the proprietary software, report any bugs you find with it. Only
your contributions can help and will make a real differences. Thanks for doing that !

**Unofficial but working repository **

I offer for those of you that for any reasons canâ€™t use successfully the free-radeon
drivers a repository where you will find the latest fglrx/catalyst drivers following the
packaging policy made avalaible by AMD. Thanks to Sebastian Siebert ( check his blog ) to
work in coordination with ati/amd and follow the catalyst packaging. His work allow us to
have that driver available for openSUSE.

**The quick how-to
**

**Adding the
repository**

**For openSUSE
11.4**


zypper ar -c -f -n "ATI/AMD fglrx non-official" http://linux.ioda.net/mirror/ati/openSUSE_11.4/ "ATI/AMD FGLRX"


**For openSUSE
11.3**


zypper ar -c -f -n "ATI/AMD fglrx non-official" http://linux.ioda.net/mirror/ati/openSUSE_11.3/ "ATI/AMD FGLRX"


**For openSUSE
11.2**


zypper ar -c -f -n "ATI/AMD fglrx non-official" http://linux.ioda.net/mirror/ati/openSUSE_11.2/ "ATI/AMD FGLRX"


**Installing the
driver**

**Nota previous version**

Due to change in ati/amd way of life, itâ€™s recommanded to completely remove any version
of fglrx previously installed with a zypper rm

I can only recommand to also (as root)


# Remove old conf & stuff
rm -fr /etc/ati
# Remove any old fglrx inside kernel modules
find /lib/modules -type f -iname "flgrx.ko" -exec rm -fv {} \;


**New installation**

Once the repo has been added, you will certainly have to reboot to get ride off free
radeon module. At boot on the grub line
add


nomodeset blacklist=radeon 3


Donâ€™t panic you will be land to a console, open it with root account to install fglrx.
Search the software you want for example under openSUSE 11.4


zypper se -s fglrx
Loading repository data...
Reading installed packages...

S | Name                  | Type    | Version | Arch   | Repository
--+-----------------------+---------+---------+--------+-----------
| fglrx64_7_6_0_SUSE114 | package | 8.812-1 | x86_64 | ATI/AMD fglrx non-official
i | fglrx64_xpic_SUSE114  | package | 8.821-1 | x86_64 | ATI/AMD fglrx non-official
| fglrx_7_6_0_SUSE114   | package | 8.812-1 | i586   | ATI/AMD fglrx non-official
| fglrx_xpic_SUSE114    | package | 8.821-1 | i586   | ATI/AMD fglrx non-official




Starting with 8.821 (Catalyst 11.2) ATI use now xpic (full explanation) So use that
one.

**For a 64bits
version**


zypper in fglrx64_xpic_SUSE114


**For a 32bits
version**


zypper in fglrx_xpic_SUSE114


During the installation process, all the dependencies will be added, which mostly are
needed to build the kernel modules. Expect around 200MB to dowload.

Then the installer will build the module for your installed kernel. And if thereâ€™s a
kernel update, the script will automagically detect that, and will rebuild the module for
the new kernel installed. (So if you find that your workstation is slow on reboot just press
the esc key to see the details â€¦ )

**Preparing xorg to use fglrx **

Once the module is build and installed, you should have a file fglrx.conf or
50-fglrx.conf in
/etc/modprobe.d


cat /etc/modprobe.d/50-fglrx.conf
blacklist radeon


Next ati recommend to use ati â€“initial-config but that break the auto-detect stack of
xorg. So I recommend changing one line in file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-device.conf

just change driver line to driver â€œfglrxâ€

All the rest of the setup (double screen etc) will be made lately with the ati catalyst
control center (command is amdcccle).

For those of you which want to have an xorg.conf file just have a look at aticonfig
â€“help command.

**Start X**

If you are inside the console we start to use before just run â€œinit 5â€³ to start xorg,
and normally you will find your normal xorg login screen (kdm, gdm, ldm, xdm). Hit
ctrl+alt+f1 to return to the console and type exit or logout or ctrl+d to close it. then
ctrl+alt+f7 to return to the xorg session.

**Updates **

ati/amd catalyst are release on a month basis, but this vary from 3 weeks to 8 weeks.

### Note

Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)**.




openSUSE 11.0 has been End-Of_life for a good while already, but the VLC Repository kept
on being available for the users still relying on it. There have not been any updates and
rebuilds for a long time (maintaining new versions became a nightmare, as underlying libraries
started to be outdated).

For this reason Iâ€™m hereby announcing that the 11.0 repositories will be removed from the
videolan download infrastructure by **March 1st 2011** ! If you
rely on having the packages available for your personal installations, please make sure to
create a local copy of the FTP tree.

On the bright side though: the 11.4 repository has just been uploaded. It is built against
the latest snapshot of 11.4, which is somewhat between RC1 and RC2. Most likely not much is
changing that would affect stability of the VLC packages. And like always of course: Factory
package keep on existing. But they did for a long time already.

This is something really trivial, but I have not actually googled out a recipe so I
thought Iâ€™d post it anyway for the googlers out there. Sometimes, you discover the Arduino
tune() function does not really work â€“ in our case, it was since we have ethernet shield
attached and apparently, some other piece of the software drives the timer (not surprising at
all) â€“ besides, the tune() function may silently abuse other pins than the chosen one, AIUI,
due to its timer usage.

Therefore, it may be useful to manually generate sounds. The code snippet really is
simple, with play-by-melody code thrown in for good measure
too:




#include "pitches.h"

/* Cue Star Wars - Darth Vader theme, opening notes! */
int melody_nak[] = { NOTE_G5, NOTE_G5, NOTE_G5, NOTE_DS5, NOTE_AS5, NOTE_G5, NOTE_DS5, NOTE_AS5, NOTE_G5};
int noteDurations_nak[] = { 330, 330, 330, 250, 120, 330, 250, 120, 500 };

int melody_ack[] = { NOTE_D6, NOTE_A6, NOTE_C7, NOTE_A6 };
int noteDurations_ack[] = { 120, 500, 120, 500 };

void toneManual(int pin, int frequency, int duration)
{
unsigned long period = 1000000/frequency;
unsigned long length;
boolean state = false;
for (length = 0; length < (long) duration * 1000; length += period) {
state = !state;
digitalWrite(pin, state);
/* The 50uS correspond to the time the rest of the loop body takes.
* It seems about right, but has not been tuned precisely for
* a 16MHz ATMega. */
delayMicroseconds(period - 50);
}
}

void playMelody(int *melody, int *noteDurations, int notes)
{
int i;
for (i = 0; i < notes; i++) {
toneManual(8, melody[i], noteDurations[i]);
delay(noteDurations[i] * 6/10);
}
}

void playMelodyAck()
{ playMelody(melody_ack, noteDurations_ack, sizeof(melody_ack)/sizeof(melody_ack[0])); }
void playMelodyNak()
{ playMelody(melody_nak, noteDurations_nak, sizeof(melody_nak)/sizeof(melody_nak[0])); }




Grab pitches.h from the digital -> tone generator example sketches, i.e. /usr/share/arduino*/examples/2.Digital/toneMelody/pitches.h.

There is one important point. With tone(), you did not need to correctly set pin mode of
the pin to output â€“ you **do need to do that** with this routine!
This took me quite a while to debugâ€¦

I am a promo guy and I can't mentor here. Nevertheless I have some [ideas for GSoC](http://community.kde.org/GSoC/2011/Ideas) and I hope to scratch
somebodies itch so she or he will mentor that idea.

**Idea 1: (More elegant) Display settings for presentations
**

Application/component: Plasma

**Brief explanation:** The handling of multiple screens has
continuously improved during the last releases. The handling of a stationary setting of two
screens seems to be rather good. When it comes to presentation-mode with a projector I would
be delighted to see even more elegance (simplicity).

**Expected results:** When doing presentations there is in
general only one question to decide. The presentation mode:






	
  1. The same picture of both screens or

	
  2. The notes on the notebook, the presentation on the projector.





To 1: Autodetect the smallest max. resolution of the two displays. Instead of scaling the
picture to full screen it would be nicer to keep the ration and leave some space blank on the
left and right notebook screen.

To 2: Autodetect the max. resolution of each of the two displays and set those different
resolutions. The panel, all the widgets and all the open windows should stay on the notebook
screen. The projector screen shows only the wallpaper. It does not matter if the projector
â€œscreenâ€ is located above or on the right or wherever of the notebook screen.

It would be very useful to link that dialog to the keyboard shortcut (e.g. Fn+F7) or to
start it automatically when a projector is attached. (At the moment I have to start krandrtray
from krunner first or have the symbol in the taskbar all the time. I am not sure if a new
users could work that out in a couple of seconds.)

Save the display/plasma settings (esp. widget positions etc.) to restore them when the
projector is detached. (Perhaps that could be solved with activities.)

Extra points: It is possible to save the standard settings. In a second step different
screen setting profiles could be saved and loaded (like in powerdevil). Presentation-mode 1
and 2 could be such profiles and a user could modify them (e.g. projector on top or right) if
it is necessary.

So what do you think. Is that scratching your itch? Can you imagine how cool this would be
to have? At least for me as a presenter that would really rock.

[Pascal Bleser: Packman service interruption and migration](http://dev-loki.blogspot.com/2011/02/packman-service-interruption-and.html)







### Note


ATM no License set.




The [Packman](http://packman.links2linux.org/) website and [repositories](http://packman.inode.at/suse/) are going to be broken and in the
works for several days (possibly up to a week) starting tonight at 20:00 CET, during which the
following services will not be available, or only sporadically:






	
  * the Packman website itself: [http://packman.links2linux.org](http://packman.links2linux.org/)

	
  * the Packman repositories, except "Essentials" (see "new repository layout"
below)





The reason is that we are performing a major migration of our services to






	
  * the latest version of the openSUSE Build Service (we were still using an old
version)

	
  * a new layout of our repositories, to enable a more fine-grained control over what
parts of Packman should be used (see below)





In order to try to keep a minimum service going during that time, you may use and point
people to our new repositories, that already contain the "Essentials" part, which are almost
complete with the bare minimum everyone needs (mplayer, vlc, libraries, ...). The URLs for the
new repositories are as follows:






	
  * [http://packman.inode.at/suse/openSUSE_11.3/](http://packman.inode.at/suse/openSUSE_11.3/)

	
  * [http://packman.inode.at/suse/openSUSE_11.2/](http://packman.inode.at/suse/openSUSE_11.2/)

	
  * [http://packman.inode.at/suse/Factory/](http://packman.inode.at/suse/Factory/)

	
  * [http://packman.inode.at/suse/SLE_11/](http://packman.inode.at/suse/SLE_11/)





There are no .repo files there yet, so adding one of these is done as
follows:


zypper ar -n packman http://packman.inode.at/suse/openSUSE_11.3/ packman


(obviously adapt the URL to your openSUSE version). You may also use one of our mirror
sites, as they already have our new repositories: [ftp://packman.links2linux.de/pub/packman/MIRRORS.](ftp://packman.links2linux.de/pub/packman/MIRRORS)

**New repository layout**

As has been announced (including here), we have had a discussion back in December about
whether and how we should reorganize the layout of our repositories. Up to now, and for many
years, it has always been "one big repository", which had pros and cons:






	
  * good: easy to use, just add onr repository and
be done with it

	
  * good: easy for us to manage

	
  * bad: you get everything and the kitchen sink,
including packages that are duplications of stuff from other repositories, specifically
from build.opensuse.org (which didn't exist when Packman was created), and potential
conflicts with those

	
  * bad: large metadata files to synchronise
(although zypper has become pretty fast at that)





We came up with a solution to this, as more and more people requested having split
repositories, in order to control whatthey want to use from Packman:






	
  * we will have four repositories instead of one: Essentials, Multimedia, Games and
Extras

	
  * Essentials will be the bare minimum to get your multimedia experience on openSUSE
going (libraries, MPlayer, vlc, ffmpeg, ...)

	
  * Multimedia will contain additional applications that are not available for openSUSE
or only in a crippled build, such as avidemux, etc...

	
  * Games are, well, games, although we will try to move most of what may be hosted on
build.opensuse.org to the games project there

	
  * Extras is all the rest





In order to provide the best of both worlds or, rather, still provide you with the old
option of adding everything, we are using a little trick and are running "createrepo" on the
top-level directory, which results in having repository metadata that contains all the
packages from all the above mentioned repositories without having to duplicate the RPM files
on our server (and mirrors).

Hence, to make it short and less technical, you can still also use the "old way"
too.

As an example of what needs to be added to zypper, once the migration is complete and
.repo files are available too:






	
  * add the Essentials
repository:


zypper ar -r http://packman.inode.at/suse/openSUSE_11.3/Essentials/Essentials.repo


	
  * add the "everything"
repository:


zypper ar -r http://packman.inode.at/suse/openSUSE_11.3/packman.repo






I will announce our progress [on my blog](http://dev-loki.blogspot.com/)
(which is also aggregated on [Planet openSUSE](http://planet.opensuse.org/))
and will obviously post another announcement here once our migration is complete.

In advance, sorry for the inconvenience, and thank you for your understanding. We are
convinced that our move will not only provide us with a better infrastructure, but also
improve your experience with Packman and openSUSE.

As in the past years, [Googleâ€™s Summer of
Code](http://code.google.com/soc/) is going to happen again and weâ€™re currently collecting ideas for [openSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org/en/). So if you want to support your favorite
distribution or seek a way to getting involved more deeply, be sure to check out our [GSoC info page](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GSOC_2011).

Or, if you want it cross-distro, the awesome [Build Service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSUSE_Build_Service) always needs
some helping hands that are curious on how to expand itâ€™s massive feature set :-) . This
includes adding support for currently unsupported distros like [Arch Linux](http://www.archlinux.org/) or [Pardus](http://www.pardus.org.tr/eng/) as well as making itâ€™s web user interface
more social.

Feel free to add you ideas to [our list](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GSOC_2011_Ideas) and discuss them on our IRC channel (#opensuse-project on FreeNode).

[Thomas Thym: GSoC idea 2: Improved (more elegant) keygeneration in
KMail/Kleopatra](http://ungethym.blogspot.com/2011/02/gsoc-idea-2-improved-more-elegant.html)







### Note

As I mentioned in my [previous
post](http://ungethym.blogspot.com/2011/02/gsoc-mentors-wanted-elegant-display.html) I can't mentor GSoC students myself and therefore are looking for a developer
to jump in for me.

**GSoC idea 2: Improved (more elegant) keygeneration in
KMail/Kleopatra **

Application/component: KDEPIM/KMail and
Kleopatra



<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" border="0" width="20%" >
<tbody >
<tr >

<td >![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cf3L8CKxspY/TWFKcHk9iYI/AAAAAAAAAC4/1leB6C1GIEY/s1600/kmail2-kleopatra.png)
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>



**Brief explanation: **

Signing and encrypting emails is very old, however only a minority is using it. One reason
might be, that it is not easy enough for regular users to use it. The importance for private
and business users is still high. Private companies started to sell proprietary, secure e-mail
services (e.g. in Germany DE-Mail and e-brief). There are good key creation, signing and other
key management functions present in KDE software. The goal of this proposal is to make it easy
and fast to work with signed and encrypted emails.

**Expected results:**






	
  1. **Analyze and optimize the key creation, signing etc processes,
make it dumb easy to create and use a key/signature**. One way could be to
add a button â€œGenerate Keyâ€ (next to â€œChangeâ€) in the KMail â€“ Identity settings â€“
Cryptographie; start the key creation wizard from Kleopatra and take the name and email
address from that identity (at the moment you have to enter them manually). The user
just has to enter the passphrase and is done. Offer a button â€œSave private key and
revoke key on usbâ€ or something like this and â€œsend public key to serverâ€ / â€œMake key
publicâ€. Add the key creation (or import possibilities) into the identity / account
creation wizard of KMail. Add the possibility to create revoke keys within the gui (when
sending the key to the server, there is an information message yet.)

	
  2. **Guide the user through the whole process of signing and
encrypting/decrypting emails.** Offer possibilities to learn about the topic
in an easy and fast way (offline help, online help / wiki, videos, tutorials etc). Show
how they use the keys, how they get their keys signed, how they sign other keys etc.

	
  3. **Integrate other free/open services** like CAcert.





These are just some ideas. If there is someone interested I could go more into details if
necessary.

[Nelson Marques: 10 good reasons for upgrading to openSUSE 11.4](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/02/22/10-good-reasons-for-upgrading-to-opensuse-11-4/)







### Note


**This Article is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation
License.**




DISCLAIMER: Based on personal preferences, and deeply personal. Other people might have
different views, this is mine






	
  * **Artwork** â€“ openSUSE 11.4 ships with â€˜Stripesâ€™
artwork. I love specially the console terminal which offers very good contrast. The boot
splash images are visually attractive and provide a pleasant boot experience.

	
  * **Wine** â€“ openSUSE 11.4 ships with Wine 1.3.10 which
works very good for me. Iâ€™ve tried Lord of the Rings Online (flawlessly out of the box)
and World of Warcraft. From the tested products, I feel that openSUSE promotion needs a
bit more of effort on highlighting Wine. Marcus must be proud, and Iâ€™m for sure thankful
for his great work!

	
  * **Repository Management **â€“ One of the main reason why
I love openSUSE is because it works like â€œLegoâ€. You can keep adding/removing software
repositories and have a hell of a kick ass experience. Success on this tasks require
some brains, but an expert tinker can perform great things with openSUSE
repositories!

	
  * **â€œOut of the Boxâ€ Factor** â€“ It just worksâ€¦ even with
my problematic ATI. This is one important point for me. I donâ€™t really like to install a
Linux distribution and spend hours tinkering it for my needs. With openSUSE itâ€™s done
fast and clean.

	
  * **Default Software Patterns** â€“ The default software
patterns on openSUSE are awesome and they fulfill all the needs for my daily computing
tasks.

	
  * **Security and Stability** â€“ Without doubt the calling
card from openSUSE. Thereâ€™s isnâ€™t really much to say, except it inspires trust!

	
  * **YaST Installer** â€“ Not being a technical person, I
have to remove my hat before openSUSE installer. It â€˜speaksâ€™ normal user language, it
provides outstanding features for advanced and starters. It inspires total supremacy of
man over machine!

	
  * **Featured upstream Projects** â€“ The most known
upstream projects are present! GNOME, KDE, LXDE and friends, even IceWM made his way
into 11.4. Banshee, VLC, you name itâ€¦ Everything can run on openSUSE, even community
repos such as GNOME:Ayatana! Whatever software you are looking for, itâ€™s for sure in a
openSUSE repository!

	
  * **GNOME** â€“ Does it need an introduction? NO! Itâ€™s
mature, stable, rock solid and will provide a powerful Desktop experience for any user!
OpenSUSE 11.4 is a must for people who want to hang around with GNOME2 for a bit more,
and for all the GNOME3 fans through an additional repository. GNOME3 is something you
canâ€™t miss! openSUSE 11.4 will enable you that feature later on!

	
  * **Community** â€“ A strong and helpful community in which
our users can rely. Swift on bug fixing, helpful when one is in trouble and commited to
bring our users the best Linux experience possible. Itâ€™s all about faces and human
interaction, itâ€™s all about being human in charge of the machine! And most of us will
speak your language!

**GSoC idea 3: Store annotations in PDF file **

Application/component: Okular/Poppler

**Brief explanation**: It is possible to store annotations
with Okular. They are saved in separat files. One of the most wanted bugs is [151614](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=151614) (123 comments, 739 votes).
It would be awsome to have that feature in our wonderful Okular.

**Expected results**:






	
  * Store annotations in the PDF file.

	
  * If that is not enough apped support to modify the PDF (insert, delete pages
etc.)





In my next life I will become a developer and the I could mentor that project myself.
Until this happens I am really hoping someone else steps up.

Another cool thing is that we have a first provider to offer hosted ownCloud services if
you donÂ´t have webspace to host it yourself. PackageCloud offers a free ownCloud installation
for 100MB and an installation with unlimited storage and traffic for 5,- EUR per month. I
think this is a very nice offer. Completely free software and more affordable than other cloud
solutions. Try it here if you donÂ´t have your own server. [https://www.packagecloud.com/?au=owncloud

GSoC 2011 ideas â€“ SaX 3](http://michal.hrusecky.net/2011/02/gsoc-2011-ideas-sax-3/)







### Note

You must already heard about this from everybody. Google Summer of Code 2011 is nearby and
openSUSE wants to participate. Currently we are collecting ideas and mentors and we are going
to apply. I also came up with few projects and volunteered to mentor them. I saw Thomas Thym
introducing his GSoC ideas and I think itâ€™s great to write a blog posts that introduce
projects. So Iâ€™ll join and here comes the first project that many of you were waiting for â€“
SaX 3.

**SaX 3**

I guess I donâ€™t have to explain what was SaX 2 good for. It is one of the most voted
features in openFATE â€“ bring SaX back to live. SaX 2 was the tool to configure X server.
Whenever your X didnâ€™t behave correctly, whenever you needed to tweak any settings, SaX 2 was
there for you. Unfortunately it worked only with xorg.conf file. Nowadays X are much better.
Weâ€™ve got auto detection of everything which works most of the time. Some little tweaks can be
added to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d directory and every tweak can be in separate file. Itâ€™s much
better than before, easier to take care of, easier to understand and maintain. But as already
mentioned, SaX2 canâ€™t handle current situation. That is why I propose creating SaX 3 as a part
of GSoC.

**Features**

Main feature is that it should be able to configure X. That means to force them to use
different mode that your monitor claims to support, force it to use different graphic card
driver or change default resolution. Also some little tweaks like per mouse drivers with
specific settings (I have pretty different settings for my trackpoint than for my external
mouse) or default keyboard layout. I guess we all expect this basic functionality from SaX.

From coding point of view, we need to keep it as small as possible. As it will be one of
the basic administration tool, we donâ€™t want it to pull in several frameworks just to
configure X. And if I canâ€™t get X working I still want to use this tool. So that makes it
obvious that ncurses UI is a must. On the other hand, once I have X running, I donâ€™t want to
see any ugly ncurses anymore, but nice Qt/GTK. So it should also support at least some toolkit
for nice and shiny X window UI. But as this might pull in some dependencies and pulling Qt to
your minimalistic PekWM desktop might sound terrifying, it should be optional and SaX should
be able to detect whether it is installed and X are running so it can use it or not.

One feature that is also a little bit important is to make it distribution independent to
make it easy for other distributions to use it, improve it and contribute back, so we will
make a world better place for all of us ;-)

**Student? **

I wrote it on the wiki and yesterday I already received an e-mail from interested student,
who is considering it! So if openSUSE and SaX3 get selected, there is a pretty good chance
that we will have it!

[We](http://packman.links2linux.org)'re going to remove the [openSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org) 11.1 [Packman](http://packman.links2linux.org) repositories from our primary server
and, hence, also our [mirrors](http://packman.links2linux.de/MIRRORS.html).

If you would like to keep a copy (for whatever reason, as they're unmaintained), make sure
to pull the tree **before
Monday** (2011-02-28).

The reason, obviously, is that [openSUSE
11.1 has gone End-Of-Life since mid-January](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2011-01/msg00005.html), and as we're [restructuring our repositories](http://dev-loki.blogspot.com/2011/02/packman-service-interruption-and.html), we do need quite some extra space right now and
don't want to put too much of a burden on our [mirrors](http://packman.links2linux.de/MIRRORS.html) (there are a few [rsync](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync) mirrors in there too).

[Petr Baudis: KMS vs Radeon 7000](http://log.or.cz/?p=122)







### Note


[This Article is licensed under the Creatice Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License]




Just a quick note for those googlers out there again. My sister has my old and trusty
Radeon 7000 (RV100) GPU in her machine and after distro upgrade, we had trouble getting it
working with respectable performance; DRI etc. was all fine after the usual installation
round of firmware-linux, but heavy 2D blipping work (e.g. moving windows, OpenTTD,
darkening/lightening whole screen in various applications) was taking awful amounts of CPU
within Xorg and things were really choppy.

It seems that there are some bugs lurking within the KMS; radeon.modeset=0 on the kernel commandline has a good shot at curing things
like this!
