The openSUSE Review Team is interested in adding 1 to 2 new members to the team.Â  This person will review submissions to opnSUSE Factory that will improve the quality of the product and add great new functionality to the already awesome openSUSE distribution.Â  Details of the tasks performed by the members of the Review Team can be seen on the [openSUSE Review Team wiki page](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:OpenSUSE_review_team) and the associated [openSUSE Factory Submissions portal](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Factory_submissions).

Ideally we want to add a non-SUSE employee from the community, but all qualified candidates will be considered.Â  (Dominique "Dimstar" Leuenberger would really appreciate some more non-SUSE folks on the team.Â  Who can blame him?!)

A qualified candidate would display the following characteristics:

a) works well with the Review Team and the openSUSE (and greater Linux) community
b) considerable expertise with RPM packaging
c) considerable expertise with openSUSE packaging methods and standards
d) reasonable awareness of Linux security concerns
e) an appreciation for quality controls and the value of solid, quality software
f) an availability to routinely perform these tasks for the community.Â  Typically a few hours per week divided over several days during the week.
g) willing to apply the rules to everybody; primary goal is to safeguard quality, not friendship :)Â Â Â  You're even allowed to decline coolo's request!

Applications will be considered until **9 September 2013**.

If you're interested, please send email to the Review Team via [review@opensuse.org](mailto:review@opensuse.org?Subject=Membership request).Â  In your email, tell a little about yourself, particularly about the "a" through "g" qualifications listed above.

Oh, and don't forget to have fun.
