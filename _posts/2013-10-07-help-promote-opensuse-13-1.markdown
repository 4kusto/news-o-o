We're not at the release, but [the beta is out](https://news.opensuse.org/?p=16747), according to the [roadmap](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Roadmap) RC1 is coming Thursday and our artists have been hard at work preparing artwork. We've got badges, backgrounds, counters and banners for you to put on your social media or blog pages, on your desktop or even on your wall! Let's make sure everybody knows what's coming.<!-- more -->


## For you blog and social media accounts


If you want to decorate your blog or website with a nice 13.1 banner, grab one of these four:


<table cellpadding="4" width="100%" cellspacing="0" > 
<tbody >
<tr valign="TOP" >

<td width="84%" >[![468x60]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/468x60-300x38.jpg)](http://en.opensuse.org/File:468x60.jpg)

As we geekos like to share, we have all this in nice svg files that you can modify to your liking [on github](https://github.com/openSUSE/artwork/tree/master/Marketing%20Materials/Web%20Banners/13.1%20Web%20Banners). The above are made by [Anditosan](http://anditosan.blogspot.com/), kudos to him!

### Twitter, facebook, G+...


For twitter, facebook and such, [VictorHCK](http://victorhckinthefreeworld.wordpress.com/) has been hacking away! Download the image of your choice [here](https://github.com/openSUSE/artwork/tree/master/Marketing%20Materials/Twitter%20Release%20Background/13.1) (images available for 'release is out' and 'is coming soon' as well as a nice plain background) and go through the following steps:



	
  1. Login in your account of Twitter

	
  2. Select _Settings_ in the top panel

	
  3. In Design tab, select _Change background image_

	
  4. Select the image

	
  5. Click on _Save changes_


Victor has also created really cool [Google+ banners](https://github.com/openSUSE/artwork/tree/master/Marketing%20Materials/Google%2B%20Release%20Images/13.1) which you can easily apply. Once our Facebook images are updated, you can get them [here](https://github.com/openSUSE/artwork/tree/master/Marketing%20Materials/Twitter%20Release%20Background). Of course, feel free to lend us a hand!


### Release Counter


[![](http://counter.opensuse.org/small.png)](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:13.1)
The release counter currently still shows 12.3 but it will be updated to 13.1 soon! The URL won't change so you can just follow the tips below and get it as soon as it is done!

You can add the openSUSE 13.1 release counter to your website in various sizes by including the following html code in your blog:
`<a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:13.1"><img src="http://counter.opensuse.org/**medium**.png" border="0"/></a><br/>`
"medium" is the size of the counter; it can also be "small" or "large" and we also have "wide" for a banner.

See [the Countdown page on the openSUSE Wiki](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Countdown) for more countdown information, code and tips!



## Going to print CD's?


And if you're planning on printing CD's, there's some awesome artwork done by Andi for that [in this github folder](https://github.com/openSUSE/artwork/tree/master/Marketing%20Materials/CD-sleeve/13.1). Lookin' real Green!

## Release is coming...


Some of you have asked about the 'release is coming' images... Yeah, we have them in higher quality and even some SVG goodness! Just click the image for the [github repo](https://github.com/openSUSE/artwork/tree/master/Marketing%20Materials/Events/Releases/13.1%20release%20is%20coming)...

[![WinterIsComingFinal]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/WinterIsComingFinal-1024x768.jpg)](https://github.com/openSUSE/artwork/tree/master/Marketing%20Materials/Events/Releases/13.1%20release%20is%20coming)

If you have any trouble with the github links, there is a nice [static mirror provided by Tigerfoot](http://geeko.ioda.net/git/artwork/). And yes, organization of so much artwork is difficult and yes, github might not be the BEST tool for downloading, but we value collaboration. And we still have to find a tool which would do a better job at that...
