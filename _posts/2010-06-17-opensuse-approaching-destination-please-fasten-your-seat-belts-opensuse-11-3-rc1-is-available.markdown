Ladies and Gentlemen,




Please fasten your seat belts, the touch down area is in sight we do have clear view and smooth weather conditions. So we expect a smooth landing for the release of openSUSE 11.3 on July 15, 2010. Let's polish and fine-tune openSUSE 11.3 now. Get the RC1 from our [software portal](//software.opensuse.org/developer/) right now!




As usual the most annoying bugs are listed [here](//en.opensuse.org/Bugs:Most_Annoying_Bugs_11.3_dev#openSUSE_11.3_RC1). But at least till release time [coolo](//en.opensuse.org/User:Coolo) couldn't find more then one bug in this category. Good sign towards a great release in July.




Have a lot of fun!
