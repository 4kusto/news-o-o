Again we have some nice, new and shiny PromoDVDs, now with openSUSE 11.0. The main goal is to spread them. Some examples:

- you organize or take part of an event
- you want good software in your school/university
- you have a local LUG meeting

To make the process easier Andreas Bauer created an order tool for it, just head over to

[http://software.opensuse.org/promodvd](http://software.opensuse.org/promodvd)

and enter your request there. The old order process, sending mails to me or marketing@whatever is now obsolete.

Everything you need to know is explained on that page. If you want information about the PromoDVD in general:
