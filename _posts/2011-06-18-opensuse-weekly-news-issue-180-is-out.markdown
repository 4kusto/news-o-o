[openSUSE Conference and RW sessions “ the BoF](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/06/14/opensuse-conference-and-rw-sessions-the-bof/)

![](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1233/928122581_043479bfd5_m.jpg)

The openSUSE conference team adopted the UNIX acronymÂ **RWX**Â for this year™s conference. The goal with this theme is to emphasize the
      stronger focus on getting-things-done and hands-on sessions. So, what sessions are we talking
      about? In this article we™ll dive into one type of interactive session: theÂ [BoF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_Feather_(computing)).

**Definition**

WikipediaÂ [defines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_Feather_(computing))Â a BoF as ˜an informal discussion group™, ˜often formed in an ad-hoc
      manner™. It also describes a BoF as ˜an informal meet-up at conferences, where the attendees
      group together based on a shared interest and carry out discussions without any pre-planned
      agenda™.

The central concepts areÂ informal,Â shared interestsÂ andÂ ad-hoc. What is not mentioned are
      goals, theÂ whyÂ of such a session. But based on the concepts, you can get an idea. The informal
      factor means everyone is equal and can and should voice their opinions. The shared interests
      mean you get together people who care about a particular subject. The ad-hoc factor merely
      re-inforces the other two. A BoF is very much like meeting for dinner: you talk as friends
      about whatever interests you! That is not to say a BoF can™t have goals. Often, BoFs have a
      number of things the participants want to discuss. The person organizing the BoF is usually
      the person who puts one or more topics forward, but everyone is free to bring up other issues.
      This is central to the concept of a BoF “ discuss things.

**Why?**

![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2363/2311306708_5a29c44a0b_m.jpg)

Free Software communities work online in a collaborative fashion. That™s marketing speak
      for: we work together, alone. While each of us sits behind his computer, either alone or with
      others in an office, we form one team. We communicate over mail, IRC and other online
      channels.

For asking questions, basic decision making or just getting work done, this is excellent.
      For socializing, it is less optimal, but you™ll still find plenty of social interactions
      especially in IRC channels. It gets much harder however, when complicated issues surface. If
      decisions have to be made about processes or fundamental technical directions, the online
      aspect gets in the way. You quickly run into misunderstandings and while our hacker culture
      compels us to fairly direct (˜rude™) communication, still emotions can run wild.

At the conference,Â **CÃ©dric Bosdonnat**Â wants to discuss
      using statistics from the LibreOffice git repositories to show information about contributions
      and contributors. He will first present the way statistics are extracted from the repository
      and then pose the question how to turn these rough statistics into valuable, meaningful
      numbers. How do you relate the lines-of-code added to the complexity of a change? How can one
      decide, from the stats, if someone is a long-term contributor? A core developer?

**This is where face to face meetings help**. Getting to know
      each other over dinner or during a party is a powerful enabler for future online
      communication. But it is also the perfect moment to make thoseÂ **hard
        decisions!** And that is where the BoF comes in.

**How?**

![](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/49/171249238_1421d15dca_m.jpg)

Discussions about future directions or day to day business like improving a review process
      or working together more efficiently “ all things done better in person. In a BoF, a team
      working together on-line meets and discusses these things, face to face, in an open manner.
      Not completely unstructured, mind you, but still very open. The organizer of the BoF is there
      merely to start up the discussion and possibly facilitate it. Facilitate by making sure some
      decisions are actually taken. And recorded!

A typical BoF starts with a short ˜hi all, thanks for coming™, and if needed an
      introduction of the participants. Then, it is time to find the subjects of the discussion at
      hand. The organizer can coin a few things he or she things need to be discussed and others can
      chime in. From there on, it™s a matter of actually going over the subjects one by one.

**Jean-Daniel Dodin**Â is involved with testing in openSUSE.
      At the conference, he wants to have a BoF centered around improving the process of testing
      multimedia applications. Many of these applications don™t work as expected or not at all. How
      can we ensure applications are tested reliably and don™t end up on a user™s desktop just if
      theycompileÂ but only after they are proven to actually work?

TheÂ **challenge**Â now is to keep the discussion from going in
      all directions “ something which is fine at a dinner but not productive at a BoF. Gently
      reminding the team of what the goal of the current topic is is usually sufficient. You all
      share the same goals, after all. The second challenge is to make sure decisions are
      takenÂ andÂ recorded. Creating the typicalÂ action listÂ of who does what is the best way to go.
      It might make sense, with a large BoF team, to have one person lead the discussion while
      someone else takes notes.

Know that the person organizing the BoF does not have to be aÂ ˜team leader™, nor aÂ ˜great
      communicator™! Every attendee is equally responsible for the quality and results of the
      discussion. Organizing the BoF is merely a technical detail “ not a huge deal at all, and
      anyone can do it.

**Responsibilities and tools**

Organizing a BoF is surprisingly simple if the right people turn up. For that, aÂ **clear description**Â is usually enough. A title like Factory review
      process discussion will most likely attract those involved with review of packages in Factory
      and interested in improving the process. If the review process has had hickups in the last few
      months it is highly unlikely that the discussion won™t be attended or not attract the right
      people. Nor is it likely to not have ˜enough to talk about™. The problem is usually more one
      of getting sidetracked and not actually finishing discussing the topic with a proper todo
      list!

What do you need to organize a BoF? Almost nothing. Pen and paper (for the todo!) will
      usually suffice. A whiteboard might be nice for more complicated problems like mapping out a
      new API, creating a flow diagram of a process or simply noting down the agreed-upon topics for
      the BoF. Otherwise, just talk! Introduce the topic quickly and ask for opinions will fire it
      off easily.

**Scheduling BoF™s**

![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2797/4537737867_3ebfc19183_m.jpg)

Usually, BoF™s are scheduled ˜on the spot™ using a big whiteboard in the main hall of the
      conference or on an open wiki page. That can lead to two similar BoF™s or two BoF™s targeting
      the same team at the same time, however. It also means you might not have a spot at a decent
      time. Which might result in being forced to plan a BoF in the time slot of a talk about the
      same subject . This is why the openSUSE CfP team asks you to plan BoF™s in advance!

The biggestÂ perceivedÂ problem with planning a BoF is the inherent contradiction in
      ˜planning™ and ˜BoF™. Yes, you might not knowÂ nowÂ what will be an issue 3 months from now.
      However, you don™t have to nail the agenda down today, that would indeed run counter to the
      whole concept of a BoF. If you think your team will benefit from having a good, open
      discussion about what you do and how you (want to) do it, simply send in a quick proposal to
      the openSUSE Conference Paper Committee. It is no problem if something more urgent pops up and
      you discuss that instead of following the initial description. The main reason for ˜planning™
      (part of) the BoF™s beforehand is to allow the CfP team to try and schedule things in such a
      way there is little overlap with talks and other BoF™s and to allow teams to reserve a
      room.

So go to the conference page and add a BoF!

[Manu Gupta: SaX3 “ GSoC 2011 “ Weekly Report 2](http://sysbytes.wordpress.com/2011/06/12/sax3-gsoc-2011-weekly-report-2/)

This is my 2nd report, this week not to show much for the users, but we did a quite
      interesteing things. SaX is now module oriented.So, if anyone wants to write a module for SaX3
      it is possible now. Besides the important things which I did was.

  1. Learn the augeas C api

  2. Submitted aÂ  .desktop lens for augeas

  3. It is module oriented

  4. Tried out Doxygen

  5. SaX3 is now localised.

The launcher is now completeÂ 

![](http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1304368896g)

Â Again, the source code is here[http://github.com./manugupt1/sax3](http://github.com/manugupt1/sax3)Â Regarding modules, If anyone wants to check out
      how modules work, they work using .desktop filesÂ  in /usr/share/sax3/modules.d. If you will
      remove it we can remove it from the launcher.

      [Ratan Sebastian: GSOC 2011:
        ssc - Week 3](http://rxvl.in/post/6481353758/gsoc-2011-ssc-week-3)

This week I was working on the local storage feature of the client. As proposed we were
      going to add and remove packages, repositories and files with a git-like workflow.
      i.e.Â 

ssc package add gnuchess

would make a local record of the intention to
      add that package and onÂ 

ssc commit

the changes would actually be
      pushed.

In order to facilitate this I™m abstracting all the directory management to a
      DirectoryManager module. Which abstracts methods to save, read and diff from local sources.
      Right now the syntax I™ve chosen is YAML. For instance theÂ softwareÂ file in the appliance
      directory - which catalogues the changes made to the appliance™s software - stores names of
      installed packages. Unless the ssc command is invoked with theÂ -r | --remoteoption, it will
      display the packages in that file. In addition whenÂ ssc package add gnuchessÂ is run with out
      the -r option, it will make and additionÂ add gnuchessÂ to the software file. Similarly for
      remove. I am having some problems figuring out how to integrate patterns into this
      architecture so any help on that front would be appreciated.

That™s it for this week. I™m going to be working on pretty much the same thing next week.
      Extending and refactoring this functionality. So hopefully we will have a more usable version
      then.Thank you for reading.

[Fridrich Strba: LibreOffice Visio import filter - shaping up the baby](http://fridrich.blogspot.com/2011/06/libreoffice-visio-import-filter-shaping.html)

Maybe you were asking yourself what happened in the Google Summer of Code Visio Import
      filter project since [last
        week](http://fridrich.blogspot.com/2011/06/libreoffice-visio-import-filter-first.html). But even if you did not ask yourself this necessary question, here is some
      update about the baby:

The focus this week was mainly on shaping the baby up. [Eilidh](http://www.derivativezero.com/blog/) added to her blog a photo and an
      "About" line and then she got exhausted and decided to rest by coding. And it is like this
      that she implemented polylines, ellipses and circular arcs.

And since the images speak louder then any words, enjoy the look: (...)

[Christos Bountalis: A utility for merging configuration / sysconfig files “ Week 4
        Report](http://cbounta.wordpress.com/2011/06/17/a-utility-for-merging-configuration-sysconfig-files-week-4-report/)

This is the 4rth week report, a lot of coding this week, you can see some code on my
      project github under branch working. Yes the code there is still not stable, but I am
      improving it constantly. Till this moment, i didn™t have any feedback except from my mentor,
      so if you check it out and have some suggestion or something, please feel free to contact me. 

**What is new in few words?**

There have been improvements in many of the functions i did, several new functions have
      been added in my augeas branch repo, i try to split things up as much as possible, to help me
      debug things. 

Functions Changed/Added:


      

  * aug_find_lense

  * aug_load_file

  * tree_child_sort_label

  * aug_process_tree

  * int label_compare

  * merge command in augtool was changed a bit too.


    

**What is next?**

The basic steps for tree matching have already been implemented, the goal now is to finish
      it and actually include the merging functions too. The tree matching is the most complex part
      as far i have understood in this project. By completing it, the other steps in the initial
      schedule will be implemented easier.

This is just a short follow-up to my older blogpost [Adding YaST menuitem to GNOME 3 status menu](http://stick.gk2.sk/blog/2011/05/adding-yast-menuitem-to-gnome-3-status-menu/). Few minutes ago [Andy](http://www.wafaa.eu/) asked me if I could create a proper gnome-shell

Will Stephenson: KDE 4.7 Beta coming to Factory

Next week the current beta of KDE 4.7 will land in openSUSE Factory. The major change
          that this brings is the full ports of KMail and KOrganizer to Akonadi.Â  These have just
          been released as part of KDE 4.6, but there may still be regressions, such as the
          inability to read mail.Â  While openSUSE does not recommend using Factory for production
          machines, we would like to emphasize that if you do use KDE PIM on Factory as your main
          mail client, be prepared to help us troubleshoot it.

I wanted to open a fate feature about this when I first heard of plymouth, but
            reading
            http://fedoramagazine.wordpress.com/2008/10/21/interview-fedora-10s-better-startup/
            really makes me think we should go this way.

Ray's comment starting with "Every flicker and mode change in the boot
            process takes away from the whole experience." is especially interesting. Is it
            okay to track the "don't show grub by default" here?






            [Update to GRUB v2 (Score: 132)](https://features.opensuse.org/308497)
          

Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn't
            going to go away. The code itself isn't well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It's only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don't have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

We need a feedback about packages that are preferred by users and actively used. Debian already has a tool named Popularity contest (popcon)

[Sascha Manns: bleachbit 0.8.8 checked in into openSUSE Build Service](http://saigkill.homelinux.net/entry/2011/06/16/bleachbit-088-checked-in-into-opensuse-build-service)

BleachBit quickly frees disk space and tirelessly guards your privacy. Free cache, delete
      cookies, clear Internet history, shred temporary files, delete logs, and discard junk you
      didn't know was there. Designed for Linux and Windows systems, it wipes clean 90 applications
      including Firefox, Internet Explorer, Adobe Flash, Google Chrome, Opera, Safari,andÃ½[more](http://bleachbit.sourceforge.net/features). Beyond simply deleting files,
      BleachBit includes advanced features such as shredding files to prevent recovery, wiping free
      disk space to hide traces of files deleted by other applications, and vacuuming Firefox to
      make it faster. Better than free, BleachBit is open source.

Now i've checked in [bleachbit](http://bleachbit.sourceforge.net/) in
        **version 0.8.8**.

What's happend since the last version? (...)

[Bruno Friedmann: ATI/AMD fglrx 8.861 Catalyst 11.6 available for openSUSE 11.2, 11.3, 11.4,
        Factory](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/06/17/atiamd-fglrx-8-861-catalyst-11-6-available-for-opensuse-11-2-11-3-11-4-factory/)

Please refer to my [previous
        article](http://lizards.opensuse.org/?p=6680) where all the installation procedure is explained.

  * Quick resume :

  * There™s no full changelog about them, but [Catalyst 11.6
            installer](http://www2.ati.com/relnotes/Catalyst_11.6_Linux_Installer.pdf) (pdf)

  * Get the cheat-sheet [11.6
            version](http://www.sebastian-siebert.de/downloads/ati-catalyst-11.6-cheat-sheet.pdf)

  * Kernel supported up to 3.0x version

  * Should be the latest version supporting 11.2

  * Wrong (to my point of view) create an xorg.conf file which is unneeded if you work
          with /etc/xorg.conf.d/50-device.conf and have driver "fglrx" inside


      

### Warning

Some instabilities could happen. In case of crash like no keyboard, mouse, and
          blackscreen on reboot. Try to shutdown properly your computer with the shutdown poweroff
          button (or remote ssh). On reboot, just add 3 at the end of grub line to restart in
          console mode. Then with yast or zypper you can always remove the actual version and try
          the previous version available in the repos.

            article](http://bit.ly/ljP3a7) (German) 


    

**What about tumbleweed, factory?**

Users have reported that version 8.861 of catalyst 11.6 compile correctly under Tumbleweed
      with 2.6.39 kernel and the driver is ready for kernel 3.0x, so until xorg change too much and
      then AMD support for the new version, installing the 11.4 version should work 

For factory, I™ve build a repository (see previous article) that can be used, and fglrx
      build.

The new package are called SUSE121 & no more SUSEFACTORY. (...)

      [Linus Torvalds: Linux 3.0-rc3](https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/6/13/375)
    

.. and this time even with a timely tar-ball, since I'm not traveling any more.



What do we have in it? More than in -rc2. I'm clearly not the only one
who was in Japan for LinuxCon, or something else just made people wake
up.

There's a lot of small one-liners, but a few bigger chunks too: Radeon
DRI updates, some btrfs updates, and fixing Sparc LEON support (and
supporting PCI). Smaller updates to nilfs2 and ceph, and s390 and arm.
Other than that, it's mostly random driver updates all over.



I'm including the shortlog, which is fairly self-explanatory: small
random changes, nothing hugely interesting. It will matter to people
only if it happens to fix that one small nagging issue you had.



But as usual, I'll ask people to give it a good testing,

I write both technical articles and novels, so without the means to collaborate with my

That is especially true for text. Scribus not only provides tools for general management

          Poortvliet: openSUSE and online services](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/06/16/opensuse-and-online-services/)

The ˜cloud™ has been a buzzword for quite a while. While some are still rather cynical
      towards the concept, products like mobile phones with Android have shown the value of putting
      your data in that huge, amorphous network of servers somewhere. Apple recently introduced
      their new cloud service and Microsoft has their cloud too. So with the other major players
      talking cloudy, what does Linux have?

![](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1165/644335254_4b8a712be5_m.jpg)

**Variety**

Let™s define Cloud technology as ˜related to putting data online & sharing among
      devices™ which is a reasonable definition for our purposes. There is a huge number of
      technologies connecting openSUSE users to online services. However there is a distinction to
      be made between commercial or proprietary operating systems and ours. We don™t create a vendor
      lock-in scenario because we focus on tools that freely connect you to your choice of publicly
      available services. This is a key distinction because we™re not owning or controlling the
      cloud that you place your data in. You, the user, get to decide the place where it best fits
      your needs and comfort level. Today and tomorrow we will highlight some of them here, starting
      with integration in our every day applications.

**Integration with online services**

openSUSE brings online services like [Facebook](http://facebook.com),
        [Flickr](http://flickr.com) and [Youtube](http://youtube.com) to your desktop in a variety of applications. New applications like [UMPlayer](http://www.umplayer.com/) and [Tomahawk](http://tomahawk-player.org/) go out of their way to deeply integrate [twitter](http://twitter.com) or [last.fm](http://last.fm), with Tomahawk even able to
      play music over a jabber (google-talk) chat connection. Of course, old-timers like [Banshee](http://banshee.fm/) and Amarok also feature music from music stores,
      pod casts and other on-line services.

Image viewers have engaged online services for a while. [F-Spot](http://f-spot.org/Features) can export to [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/), [23](http://www.23hq.com/),
        [Picasa Web](http://picasaweb.google.com/) or [SmugMug](http://www.smugmug.com/). [Shotwell](http://yorba.org/shotwell/) can even export to Youtube. KDE applications [Digikam](http://www.digikam.org/drupal/about/features9x) and it™s companion
      Showfoto add [Facebook](http://facebook.com), [piwigo](http://piwigo.org/), [shwup](http://www.shwup.com/),
        [zooomr](http://www.zooomr.com/) and some other sites to the list. They
      can also export to a HTML gallery and put the images with the locations they were taken at on
      Google Maps. This is shared KDE infrastructure so you can expect image viewer [Gwenview](http://gwenview.sourceforge.net/) and even screenshot application
        [ksnapshot](http://www.elpauer.org/?p=509) to be able to directly share
      over these services.

It™s not just media tools which integrate with online services. [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/) can export and import documents from
      online office suites like [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com) and [Zoho](http://zoho.com). And of course, mail/agenda/news clients like [Evolution](http://projects.gnome.org/evolution) and [KDE PIM](http://pim.kde.org) have offered integration with online services like
      mail or calendaring forever. Feed readers like [Liferea](http://liferea.sourceforge.net/) offer syncing your news feed with [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader) and [TinyTinyRSS](http://tt-rss.org/).

Besides integrating with existing services, Free Software projects are starting their own.
      Prominent examples are GNOME™s [Tomboy](http://projects.gnome.org/tomboy/)
      which synchronizes your notes between instances using an online service.

**More**

But there is more available for openSUSE. There are several file sharing and syncing
      services out there. Look for an article about those tomorrow!

      and especially the cool Free Software project ownCloud!

**File sharing and syncing services**

A file sharing and syncing service helps you keep the files on several computers in sync
      and allows you to share such files with others on the web. This is indeed what Apple recently
      introduced, but others have gone before.

[SpiderOak](https://spideroak.com/) offers such an online space for
      synchronizing files. Just drop the files in a specific folder on your drive and you can share
      them between your computers, mobile devices and even with other people. SpiderOak is included
      in the openSUSE repositories since openSUSE 11.3.

The popular [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) service offers a similar
      online space, and even comes with integration in the [Nautilus file manager](http://live.gnome.org/Nautilus)!

But both services depend on proprietary server components and need a proprietary daemon to
      run on your system. Dropbox also doesn™t encrypt the data on the server, something Spideroak
      at least does. SpiderOak also promised to at some point open source their client software.
      Still, the server side and web interface will remain closed. Luckily there are Free Software
      solutions out there, two of them I™ll talk about here.

**Introducing iFolder**

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/iFolder2clean_filmgrain_picture-300x212.png)

[iFolder](http://www.kablink.org/ifolder) is a Free Software file
      storage, backup and sharing solution written in C# and Mono. iFolder comes with a desktop
      client which allows you to manage your iFolders. iFolders can be located on any number of
      servers, each having a number of folders which you can manage independently. Each folder can
      be your own or shared with others and files dropped or modified in them will be synced right
      away. iFolder, like Dropbox and SpiderOak, has clients for Windows, Mac and Linux and new is a
      web interface so you can access your files anywhere and share them with others on-line.

iFolder does have some powerful capabilities, especially for corporate environments. For
      example, unlike most competing solutions it only transfers modified portions of files instead
      of the whole file, saving you some bandwidth. iFolder also offers integration with LDAP, disk
      quotas, and limits to the number of iFolders each user has. It integrates in the Desktop with
      a Nautilus plugin which allows you to turn any folder into a shared iFolder and iFolder has
      fully encypted file transfer and storage. Finally, a big plus of iFolder is the excellent
      documentation which you can find [here](http://ifolder.com/ifolder/documentation).

So unlike Dropbox and SpiderOak, iFolder is fully Free Software and the source is [hosted on sourceforge](http://community.ifolder.com/ssf/a/c/p_name/ss_forum/p_action/1/action/view_permalink/entityType/folderEntry/entryId/4244) and can be found [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ifolder/). With 9 commits in the last 2
      months it is not a hugely active project and the last release is from November 2009. Still bug
      fixes are being added and lots of improvements were landed in 2010. You can find more
      up-to-date versions by [searching on OBS](http://software.opensuse.org/search?q=ifolder&baseproject=ALL&lang=en). And it should be noted that this ˜old™ version of iFolder has been offering all the features of Dropbox and
      SpiderOak, fully open and free, for years!

**introducing ownCloud**

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/owncloud-logo-300x148.png)

[ownCloud](http://owncloud.org/) is an exciting and much more active
      project, developing file synchronization technology on a Free Software base. However, ownCloud
      is far more ambitious as you can read in [this
        recent blogpost](http://blog.karlitschek.de/2011/06/yesterday-apple-announced-their-new.html) by lead developer Frank Karlitschek. Frank welcomed Apple to the
      Cloud, giving a feature comparision between ownCloud and their cloud offering. He mentioned
      that:



Apple finally [has] features which are essential for people who live in a connected
        world and have more than one device



Furthermore, after having a look at what Apple came up with, he concludes:



It seems that we support everything iCloud is doing and a bit more if you look into the
        feature set. And we have a fundamentally more advanced vision and architecture.



ownCloud offers all the basics of accessing files via a variety of means including a web
      interface and WebDAV. WebDAV support means integration in both [Nautilus](http://live.gnome.org/Nautilus) and [Dolphin](http://dolphin.kde.org/), as well as all KDE and most GNOME
      applications. ownCloud can synchronize application data like Bookmarks and settings and allows
      you to listen to your online music collection in a few ways including from [Ampache](http://ampache.org/) and via the web interface. The same goes for
      movies and photo™s while PIM syncing is in the works.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ownCloud_Login-300x173.jpg)

Above and beyond iCloud, work is going on in ownCloud to offer versioning of all files
      through it™s git backend and the ability to share your files with whomever you want. More
      importantly, ownCloud is extensible. It is possible to write addons to ownCloud like RSS
      readers, todo lists and note syncing or even collaborative gaming. And ownCloud doesn™t limit
      you with DRM or digital fingerprints, allowing you to put your music and movies online without
      restrictions. Finally, where Apple™s cloud just works with Apple devices (as we™ve come to
      expect from them), ownCloud is not so picky, working with Windows, Mac and Linux as well as
      Android, MeeGo and of course the iPhone. This is possible because ownCloud uses open standards
      and works with Free Software where possible, including the mentioned webDav, HTML5, [Open
        Collaboration Services](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/open-collaboration-services) and [Ampache](http://ampache.org/). An
      access library for applications, to offer better integration with ownCloud, is already
      available and part of the latest openSUSE.

**Upcoming**

And more is [coming in
        ownCloud 2.0](http://owncloudtest.blogspot.com/2011/06/owncloud-20-just-merged-with.html), scheduled for later this year. The UI has been completely redesigned
      and there is now media support to play audio and video via the web interface. The mentioned
      Ampache support, developed by Robin Appelman, will have a nice effect: the awesome [Tomahawk music player](http://tomahawk-player.org/) we [mentioned
        yesterday](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/06/16/opensuse-and-online-services/) has Ampache support and thus will be able to play music directly from your
      ownCloud 2.0 server!

Moreover, user management has been improved as well, and you will be able to extend
      ownCloud with new functionality via apps and plugins! Finally, ownCloud aims to support not
      only Chromium and Firefox but also lesser used browsers like Konqueror. A really exciting
      feature is being worked on by a [GSOC](http://code.google.com/soc/) student:
      git versioning of files! There is some UI work to be done, which will then allow you to go
      back in time and see earlier versions of your files.

Aaron, one of the ownCloud developers, gives [his
        thoughts](http://owncloudtest.blogspot.com/2011/06/owncloud-20-just-merged-with.html) on where ownCLoud should go:



With this, we can not only compete with Apple & Google, we can leave them behind or
        integrate with them from our own camp. There™s no reason you shouldn™t be able to play your
        music from the cloud in Amarok or Tomahawk, view your calendar events on your iPhone and in
        Kontact and access all of your files from Android or webOS or Gnome or Windows or OS X. You
        should also be able to back up your home directory and keep it in sync between multiple
        computers



**Control**

The most important feature of ownCloud, however, is control. In Frank™s words:



You don't have to put your private data into the hosting center of a big company



You can install ownCloud on your own server, your desktop at home, a company server but
      also at a hosting provider supporting PHP, or run it as appliance in some cloud service under
      your direct control. Because it is Free Software, you fully own your data and only you can determine what happens with it.

All this doesn™t have to mean ownCloud is hard to set up. The upcoming 2.0 version will
      make it drastically easier to deploy but the current 1.2 release can also be had in a number
      of very easy ways.

**Get ownCloud**

You can install owncloud on your own server or even desktop using the [openSUSE
        repositories on OBS](http://software.opensuse.org/search?q=owncloud&baseproject=ALL). Be sure to read [the documentation](http://owncloud.org/index.php/Installation#openSUSE) on
      starting and managing your ownCloud. You can also use the how-to on [Aaron™s
        blog](http://owncloudtest.blogspot.com/2011/06/getting-your-owncloud.html) to get the latest and freshest version installed from source! After following
      the basic installation steps, you just have to go to [127.0.0.1](http://127.0.0.1/owncloud/index.php) in your browser to complete the
      setup from the web interface.

However, your ownCloud can be had easier. You can use the excellent [ownCloud-in-a-box SUSE Studio
        image](http://susegallery.com/a/TadMax/owncloud-in-a-box) to download a virtual image of ownCloud and start running it right away. It
      gets even more interesting with the [Amazon Elastic
        Cloud Computing](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) support of SUSE Studio. Deploying your image on the Amazon cloud
        [is
        easy as pie](http://blog.susestudio.com/2011/05/its-never-been-so-ec2-access-cloud.html). You could use [microinstance](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) for which even a [free 1-year
        subscription](http://aws.amazon.com/free/) is available. Yes, that™s right, you can have your openSUSE ownCloud under your full
      control on Amazon EC2 for **FREE** for one year!

If running your own Appliance on EC2, another provider or your own hardware is still a tad
      complicated, there is an even easier option: [packagecloud.com](https://www.packagecloud.com/?au=owncloud). They offer
      ownCloud hosting (including a free option, yup) with their convenient web interface. Yes,
      again, full control over your own data and easy to use.

**Helping out**

ownCloud is a Free Software project, which means you can get involved. The team is looking
      for anyone who has some skills in (or wants to learn) PHP, C++, HTML, CSS & Javascript.
      Drop by #owncloud on freenode or send an email to owncloud on kde.org and get involved
      today!

**Conclusion**

Frank closes his blog with:



I think ownCloud has the potential to become the cloud storage solution for people who
        donÃ½t like vendor lock-ins and care about freedom and privacy



We would like to go a step further and claim that the wide variety of hosting options for
      ownCloud offers not only more security and privacy but also far more flexibility and, in time,
      lower prices than what Google, Apple, Microsoft and the other ˜big boys™ bring to the table.
      Combined with the excellent integration openSUSE desktops already offer with online services,
      openSUSE has a sunny future in the cloud.

### For Commandline/Script Newbies




        [Linux.com/Carla Schroder: Things You Can't Do With a GUI: Finding Stuff on Linux](http://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/458715:things-you-cant-do-with-a-gui-finding-stuff-on-linux)
      

What's better, a graphical interface or the Linux command line? Both of them. They blend seamlessly on Linux so you don't have to choose. A good graphical user interface (GUI) has a logical, orderly flow, helps guide you to making the right command choices, and is reasonably fast and efficient. Since this describes a minority of all GUIs, I still live on the command line a lot. The CLI has three advantages: it's faster for many operations, it's scriptable, and it is many times more flexible. Linux's Unix heritage means you can string together commands in endless ways so they do exactly what you want. (...)

        [Nelson Marques: openSUSE 11.4 with GNOME2 for the ˜cool kids™¦ a brief howto!](http://www.marques.so/2011/06/opensuse-11-4-with-gnome2-for-the-cool-kids-a-brief-howto/)
      

In the past I™ve written a small howto in Portuguese to perform a openSUSE 11.4 GNOME2
        featured installation in Portuguese. Until today I still receive lots of feedback and some
        personal emails from Portuguese and Brazilian (mostly) users about it.

I™ve always preached that the nice of openSUSE was the fact of allowing the users to
        install a vast number of repositories and running an updated application layer on top of a
        powerful and reliable base. This article isn™t really about ˜installing™ openSUSE, but
        instead it™s focused on the post install configuration of kinky repositories and stuff that
        by the traditional reasons isn™t provided as standard in openSUSE.

This document will cover the following aspects:

  1. Installation of sub-pixel font rendering (from a OBS user repository);

  2. Installation of latest development release of Wine (1.3.21);

  3. Installation of the most common multimedia codecs from Packman Essentials;

At the end, the user should have a working openSUSE 11.4 GNOME2 Desktop with very cool
        sub-pixel font rendering (this really kicks ass) and have an idea of the potential that
        openSUSE can deploy for customized systems. (...)

It doesn™t matter how it happened, it doesn™t matter why, blame can (and probably will) be placed later.

The good news is that the server, somehow, is still running fine, and the system is still up. The bad news is that the directory where MySQL stores the database is now empty.

      [Jakub Steiner: Killing Mode Switch](http://jimmac.musichall.cz/log/?p=1181)
    

As Allan already mentioned inÂ one of his useful summaries, I™ve been pondering how how to
      improve the layout of the application picker in shell™s overview. While theÂ mockupÂ he showed
      does address the small click target problem, it still felt out of place with relation to the
      dash. I tried to applyÂ different lipstickÂ on it, but there was something inherently wrong with
      the layout and the overview lost its clean, no boxes feel.

The reason for theÂ windows/applicationsÂ toggle was easy extensibility. We thought of using
      shell to access people/contacts in the same way as we access applications. We thought to
      present documents in a better way without exposing the filesystem here as well. We thought the
      orthogonal arrangement ala Sony™s XMB would be fun on touch devices. Over time, I have come to
      the conclusion that extending the scope of shell might do more harm than good. I™ve never been
      a fan of all-in-one solutions ala iTunes. (...)

        [Adobe/Dave Mc Allister: Focusing on the next Linux Client](http://blogs.adobe.com/open/2011/06/focusing-on-the-next-linux-client.html)
      

Way back in 1999 I predicted a significant market for desktop Linux by 2005. Â (I was
        targeting better than Mac OS type numbers, in the 10-15% range.) Â It was clear back then
        that Linux had found a substantial adoption as a server OS, and it seemed only time before
        the desktop adoption rivaled at least the other desktop.

The Document Foundation today announced the first members of its Advisory Board: Google,
        SUSE, Red Hat, Freies Office Deutschland e.V., Software in the Public Interest, and the Free
        Software Foundation. The new appointees will serve for an initial term of one year.

The body represents The Document Foundation™s sponsors, with each sponsor having the
        right to one representative. They will provide the future Board of Directors with advice,
        guidance and proposals, and will consult regularly on the further development of the
        Foundation and its associated projects.

We™re very proud, and warmly welcome the first members of the Advisory Board. Its composition shows that LibreOffice is a vendor-neutral, truly-free office suite, and confirms that The Document Foundation has created a solid base to build upon, for the community, for corporations and enterprises, and for adopters and end-users, said Florian Effenberger on behalf of The Document Foundation™s
        Steering Committee. With LibreOffice being downloaded from all over the world, with the community growing quickly, and with organizations and corporations showing strong support, The Document Foundation has succeeded in creating a safe, stable and secure base to ensure the future of free office suites, he added.
