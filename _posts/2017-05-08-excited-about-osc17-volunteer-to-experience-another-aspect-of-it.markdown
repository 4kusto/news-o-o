![](/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/osc17final.png)oSC17 is just around the corner, and if you want to be part of making it awesome you can now sign up to become a volunteer!

Volunteers are invaluable to conferences, and they play a major role in creating a pleasant conference atmosphere for attendees.

We need volunteers to help out with various things throughout the conference, such as:



 	
  * Help at the registration desk, which involves:

 	
    * welcoming people at the conference and marking them as attended

 	
    * help people find what they are looking for (rooms, toilet, bus stop, etc.)

 	
    * assist people with the schedule, and direct them to the next available session (keynote, workshop, etc)

 	
    * provide people with a t-shirt and urge them to put on a name tag

 	
    * handle incidents that might come up




 	
  * Help with speakers by making sure that:

 	
    * speakers know where they need to be before their talk

 	
    * there is a bottle of water and glasses at the speaker desk

 	
    * speakers upload their presentation and make the link public in OSEM




 	
  * Help setup everything on Friday morning, and tear down on Sunday evening


Volunteers will receive an instructions sheet, as well as a short briefing. Please be available at the registration desk 15-30 minutes prior to the time you are scheduled to volunteer.

Make sure to fill out the [volunteers form](http://goo.gl/Nq3HgQ), so that we know we can count on your help!
