We have some exciting news to share regarding the consolidation of our web pages.

We've decided to drop functionality behind https://software.opensuse.org/distributions and instead provide a redirect to https://get.opensuse.org.
Submit request can be found here https://github.com/openSUSE/software-o-o/pull/943.

Both sites were offering similar functionality for downloading install media. Both sites had to be updated with every Alpha, Beta, or changes to media descriptions.
The new reduced scope of software-o-o will be purely browsing of available software.
The scope of get-o-o won't change. It will be media downloads and pointers to relevant documentation such as installation or upgrade instructions. We believe that these changes will help to keep it small and simple.

We're happy to reduce duplication of efforts while not introducing further fragmentation as get.opensuse.org has been around for quite some time already.
