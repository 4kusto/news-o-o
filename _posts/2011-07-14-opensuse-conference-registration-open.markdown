## Preparations


Two months from now the openSUSE and SUSE Labs Conference will kick off in Nuremberg, Germany. That means, as flights don't get cheaper, you have to start planning! Ask your boss for some days off, start telling your professor you won't be there from September 11-14. Start looking for a reasonable flight or train fare, [book a hotel](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_hotels) and then you're ready to [register for the conference](http://conference.opensuse.org/indico/confRegistrationFormDisplay.py?confId=2). Of course, be sure you have [submitted a session](news.opensuse.org/2011/05/16/opensuse-conference-2011-to-be-creative-and-open/) if you want to give a talk, organize a BoF (team meeting), lead a hack session or give a workshop.


### Hotel


The openSUSE conference team has made [a list of hotels](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_hotels) where you can book your stay for the duration of the conference. It is recommended to use these hotels as they will not only have fellow geekos in them but are also reasonably priced (special conference prices!) and not too far from our location, [Zentrifuge](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_Location_Zentrifuge).

### Travel support


For some of you, the trip to Nuremberg is financially not easy. You might be a student, or have to fly in all the way from India. We know that very well and it is the main reason why we [are looking very hard for sponsors](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/06/08/opensuse-conference-looking-for-sponsors/)! Within a week, you can count on an announcement of the what and how of travel subsidy, but rest assured that we will do everything we can to ensure our community members from far away or on low budget are also able to come and join us!


### Visa


Another important thing to think of in time is access to Europe/Germany. We have a standard invitation letter you can get from us on request. For that, send a mail with some personal details (who you are, what you do for openSUSE, what you will do at the conf, that stuff) to [opensuse-conference@opensuse.org](mailto:opensuse-conference@opensuse.org) and the team will send you one.

## Registration


Registering makes sure there's a badge for you at the conference, you won't have to wait in line for us to create one for you on the spot. It'll also make sure you are able to go on the wifi and we have a place for you at the party. And of course it allows us to plan better so it matters a lot that you register as soon as possible if you intend to come!

Please note that for the registration, you don't have to create an account. And you will have to book a hotel yourself, see [this page](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_hotels)!

Last but not least, there is an option between [two different tickets](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Professional_conf_ticket). Entrance is free for all but those who want to support the conference and can afford it can buy a professional ticket. For $350 or â‚¬250 you get, besides access to the conference, a networking dinner with the speakers and other professional ticket holders as well as a session with SUSE Product Management.
