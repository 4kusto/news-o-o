Join the openSUSE Project this weekend, Saturday August 23, and Sunday August 24, at third annual [FrOSCon](http://www.froscon.org). FrOSCon is a two day conference on Free Software and Open Source, taking place at the Fachhochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg in Sankt Augustin near the cities of Bonn and Cologne.

Come to the openSUSE booth to meet other openSUSE community members, and get your own copy of the openSUSE 11.0 DVD if you don't have one already! You can also catch Marko Jung's talk on his concept of a trust system for the openSUSE Build Service on Sunday, at 11:15 a.m. in lecture room HS5.

In addition to the openSUSE-related activities, the whole conference program features many highlights. On Saturday, Andrew S. Tanenbaum will give a keynote on "Minix 3 - A Reliable and Secure Operating System", held at 12:45 in HS1 Tanenbaum is a professor of computer science at the Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam. He became famous as developer of the system Minix. In 1992 he caused a sensation by criticizing Linux as an obsolete operating system.

On the second day of the conference, PHP inventor Rasmus Lerdorf will give his keynote titled "Simple is hard." Lerdorf will talk about the trouble of finding a simple solution and the increasing affinity to comlexity which causes problems in performance, scalability, and security.

If you'd like to help with the openSUSE booth at FrOSCon, we're still looking for additional volunteers. Please contact [Marko Jung](http://en.opensuse.org/User:Markojung).
