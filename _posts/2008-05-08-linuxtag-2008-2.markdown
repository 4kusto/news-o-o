Please don't forget the biggest Linux event in Germany, just a few weeks away! For the second time it will be in Berlin, from 28-31.05.2008. The location is slightly different, still at Messehalle Funkturm, but this time it's hall 7 (south instead of east like last year).

Again we try to have an interesting program for you, let me be little bit more verbose ...

- booth: meet the openSUSE community, talk with developers and see the latest openSUSE 11.0 beta/RC running. We will have decent hardware and big screens to show openSUSE in all it's glory. :-) We are happy that we have again a community project at our booth, this time it's [Linux-Club.de](http://linux-club.de), a big German Linux forum. If you are interested in the Novell Enterprise products, we will have also a counter with SLE. You can also meet [Zonker](http://zonker.opensuse.org) for the first time in Germany! 

- openSUSE day: one day, packed with talks, this time on Saturday! Look at the schedule for more information, we think that there is something for everybody in it. 

There are of course a lot of other interesting open-source projects at the LinuxTag, so if you are in Germany/Berlin, don't miss it!
