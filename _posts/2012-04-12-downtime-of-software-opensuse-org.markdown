[![Failed geeko](http://en.opensuse.org/images/4/43/Failgeeko.png)](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Downtime)We had some network problems in our NÃ¼rnberg data center this afternoon and now the site software.opensuse.org is not reachable.

To download the openSUSE 12.2 Milestone 3, go directly to the [download directory](http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/12.2-Milestone3/iso/).

To download openSUSE 12.1, go directly to the [12.1 download directory](http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/12.1/).

For everything else, please wait until the server is fully up again.

**Update 2012-04-12 19:37 UTC:** Everything should be up again.
