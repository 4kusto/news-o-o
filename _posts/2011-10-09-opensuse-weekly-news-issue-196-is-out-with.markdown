[Hackweek results for openSUSE ARM](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/10/04/hackweek-results-for-opensuse-arm/)

Last Friday Dirk MÃ¼ller [send an email to
        openSUSE-Factory](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2011-09/msg01259.html) about the status of the [openSUSE ARM port](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:ARM). SUSE employees Adrian,
      Alexander, Dirk and Reinhard had spend their Hackweek revitalizing the initial work by
      Jan-Simon and Martin by getting openSUSE Factory on ARM to build and work. The [current build
        status on OBS](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=openSUSE%3AFactory%3AARM) shows that almost 2500 packages are working successfully and the team
      invites anyone interested to come and help increase that number!

[openSUSE
        Board Election Committee Formed](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/10/05/opensuse-board-election-committee-formed/)

The 2011 openSUSE Board term is soon coming to an end. In the last few project meetings as
      well as at the conference, the board has called for people to step up for the Election
      Committee. Five openSUSE contributors have offered their help and weâ€™d like to introduce them
      to you.

**The Team**

The openSUSE Board is proud to welcome the following members of our openSUSE Community as
      this yearâ€™s Election Committee:

  * Izabel Valverde

  * Kai-Uwe Behrmann

  * James Mason

  * Kostas Koudaras

  * Thomas Schmidt

**The Job**

In the coming days and weeks, this committee will act independently to implement a formal
      plan for the oversight and election of a new Board for the 2012 term. Currently, three board
      seats will be up for election. These seats are currently held by Rupert Horstkotter, Pavol
      Rusnak, and Bryen Yunashko (whose seat is vacated due to term limits.)

The Election Committee will announce the nomination process and election period as part of
      the election plan. Please stay tuned for further news from the Committee itself.

We are sure this team will perform its duties to the best benefit of the openSUSE Project
      and we look forward to an exciting election term and seeing many openSUSE Community members
      stepping up as candidates in the upcoming election.

**Hackweek** is an event in SUSE where developers can work on
      any pet project for a week (like Google's 20%) This year's edition[ happened last week](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Hackweek) in SUSE. Since I am
      part of the openSUSE community, I too participated in the spirit of this event in my night
      time. The project is codenamed Arattai.

I tried to bring a prototype to provide IM/Chat support built-in to the Chromium browser.

      [Tor Lillqvist:
        Hack Week, Autumn 2011](http://tml-blog.blogspot.com/2011/10/hack-week-autumn-2011.html)
    

During this hack week I worked on making LibreOffice build also against the MacOSX 10.5,
      10.6 and 10.7 SDKs. We had some support for that in the configure.in already, but it had
      apparently never been tested what then happens if one actually tries something other than the
      10.4 SDK.

Mostly, with some changes here and there, and except for 10.7, I got it to work, and also
      the resulting LibreOffice built against the 10.6 SDK seemed to work.

Building against the 10.7 SDK fails because some APIs that were deprecated already in
      10.4, but the Mac code in LibreOffice still uses, have now then finally been removed in the
      10.7 SDK. This shows the sad state of our Mac code.

I also experimented with building against the 10.6 SDK but with MacOSX 10.4 as the target
      OS API level. I didn't get such a build to finish yet, but I am continuing on it in the
      background. The idea here is that if it would be possible to build LO to run fine on 10.4 even
      if you build it using the 10.6 SDK, we could get rid of one requirement for our (at least
      Intel) Mac build that is getting more and more silly: That you need to install the old Xcode 3
      (with 10.4 and 10.5 SDKs) in addition to, or instead of, the current Xcode 4 (with 10.6 and
      10.7 SDKs).

[Noel Power:
        hackweek #7 oletool.py](http://noelpower.blogs.ie/2011/10/07/hackweek-7-oletoolpy/)

Last year for some reason that I canâ€™t recall I only managed to take 1 day of hackweek,
      back then I started [oletool.py](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/contrib/mso-dumper/tree/src/oletool.py). oletool.py is intended to be like a cheap & nasty (zip/unzip)-like
      command-line tool for OLE compound documents. I started this for 2 reasons

  1. I often play with Libreoffice filters, many times I want to either extract some
            stream or other from a document to examine it or maybe quickly modify a stream re-inject
            it into the document to test some code or theory

  2. Libreoffice has support for Python, I know nothing about Python and I wanted to
            learn a new scripting language ( I know I could have used libgsf for this tool - maybe
            something for some spare cycles )

So, has to be said I wasnâ€™t starting completely from scratch, Kohei already created [mso-dumper](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/contrib/mso-dumper/) for
      dumping the content of Excel documents in python. Last year I was happy with my one dayâ€™s
      work, I managed using Koheiâ€™s mso-dumper code to quickly cobble together a tool that allowed
      the contents of the document to be displayed ( ala gsf list type format ) and also extract one
      or more streams. (...)

            [Look at plymouth for splash during boot (Score: 195)](https://features.opensuse.org/305493)
          

I wanted to open a fate feature about this when I first heard of plymouth, but
            reading
            http://fedoramagazine.wordpress.com/2008/10/21/interview-fedora-10s-better-startup/
            really makes me think we should go this way.

Ray's comment starting with "Every flicker and mode change in the boot
            process takes away from the whole experience." is especially interesting. Is it
            okay to track the "don't show grub by default" here?

            [1-click uninstall (Score: 167)](https://features.opensuse.org/305305)
          

An easy way to remove Software! For example: you installed an application with "1-click install" (which will install all the packages that you need), there should be an easy way (also with 1 click) to remove what you have installed with that 1-click operation... in another words: an "1-click Uninstall" to remove installed software (dependencies and packages included).

â€œ


            [Update to GRUB v2 (Score: 157)](https://features.opensuse.org/308497)
          

Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn't
            going to go away. The code itself isn't well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It's only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don't have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

[Xonotic](http://www.xonotic.org/) is a free first-person shooter game
      for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. The Xonotic project started as a fork of Nexuiz, a game which
      was popular for many years on Linux. The fork was created because Nexuiz was licensed to
      IllFonic game studios, and it is to be used as a platform for developing a commercial game for
      Steam, Xbox and PlayStation.

![](http://www.tuxarena.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/xonotic000007-640x480.jpg)

Xonotic uses the Darkplaces game engine, an engine which started as a Quake modification,
      but it was under heavy development and new improvements were made. Currently the developers of
      Xonotic state that the game is â€œon the par with most commercial games from 2006-2007â€³. Which,
      for the Linux platform is pretty important. (...)

Iâ€™ve just noticed that [Frozenbyte](http://frozenbyte.com/) is already
      doing the beta for [Trine 2](http://www.trine2.com), a fun platform game.
      The fun thing is that according to several sources on their forums they are planing to launch
      Trine 2 for Linux alongside with the Windows version or â€œshortly afterâ€. I never heard of this
      game before and the video makes me remember of a very old DOS game called Goblins III. Either
      way the video is awesome and Iâ€™m pretty sure this is a potential purchase for my game

          Customizing GNOME3](http://nbprashanth.wordpress.com/2011/10/01/customizing-gnome3/)
      

GNOME3 and the GNOME Shell are no doubt, major improvements. They bring in usability and
        quite a bit of eye candy (in a different way compared to compiz) while at the same time, a
        few features went missing in 3.0 release â€“ like Emblems, for instance. Nevertheless, GNOME3
        is a great release and has been extremely stable so far (Yes, i have been using it since
        itâ€™s release in April.). 

One major complaint that I hear from people is that GNOME3 is not as easy to customize
        as 2.x. A lot of people seem to think that they are â€œstuckâ€ with the blue-black theme that
        comes by default. Ofcourse this is not the case. In this post, I ll explain a few ways in
        which we can customize GNOME3 and the GNOME Shell. (...)

        [The Geek Stuff/Himanshu Arora: Journey of a C Program to Linux Executable in 4 Stages](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/10/c-program-to-an-executable/)
      

You write a C program, use gcc to compile it, and you get an executable. It is pretty simple. Right?

Have you ever wondered what happens during the compilation process and how the C program gets converted to an executable?

There are four main stages through which a source code passes in order to finally become an executable. (...)

          Internationalization](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-lpic3-312-6/index.html)
      

If you work in a mixed environment in which non-English characters are used, you need to
        understand character codes and code pages as they relate to your locale. You also need to
        understand Linux and Windows environments differ when interpreting name spaces. Although
        Samba supports internationalization, if you work with older Windows clients , Samba 2.x
        versions, or otherwise need to use a specific character set other than Unicode, you'll need
        to do a bit of configuration tuning. Depending upon the environment's locale in use,
        building and patching conversion libraries may also be necessary. In this article, learn how
        to handle internationalization in your Linux environment. (...)

          J. Vaughan-Nichols: How to lock down Linux](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/how-to-lock-down-linux/9665)
      

Linux is, by design, a very secure operating system, but so what? You can have the best
        security system in the world on your house, but if you leave your front-door open anyone can
        still walk in. Even people who know better, like Linux kernel developers, blow it sometimes.
        Thatâ€™s what happened to the [Linux Foundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org)â€™s constellation of sites. [Multiple important Linux sites were down for weeks](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/some-linux-foundation-crack-attack-details-emerge/9535) and as of October 3rd, [kernel.org](http://http://kernel.org) is still down. This doesnâ€™t have to
        happen to you. Here are a few simple suggestions from me, and some more advanced ones from
          [Greg Kroah-Hartman](http://www.kroah.com/log/), one of Linuxâ€™s lead
        developers. (...)

[Andrew Wafaa: Hardware needed for openSUSE on ARM](http://www.wafaa.eu/entry/hardware-needed-for-opensuse-on-arm-1-71.html)

As I [mentioned](http://www.wafaa.eu/entry/target-arm-hardware-1-70.html) before, we have an initial target platform identified for testing the
      work of all those involved in the openSUSE ARM port. The problem is we need to obtain the
      hardware.

I am in discussions trying to get some corporate sponsorship of hardware, but we can not
      rely soley on those kind companies that would like to see us succeed. We as a community need
      to help ourselves succeed, as such I've set up a [campaign](http://pledgie.com/campaigns/16098) on Pledgie to enable us the

Well, once again, I had a chance to meet a community, one of which, I have never met
      before ;-) 

I arrived at [Zentrifuge](http://www.zentrifuge-nuernberg.de/) on the
      10th of September for the warmup to the [oSC](http://conference.opensuse.org/). Immediately after arrival, I was greeted with warm smiles, open discussions,
      and cold beer ;-) No one knew who I was, but they all welcomed me. As the evening continued, I
      was witness to how the community also made sure that they welcomed everyone, once they
      arrived. This is pure class and I would like to say is very important to a newbie who is
      entering the community. This is one aspect where openSUSE makes the difference, since it is
      not practiced to this extent in many other communities.

[Gregory M. Zysk: openSUSE Marketing Hackfest 2011](http://openleadership.blogspot.com/2011/10/opensuse-marketing-hackfest-2011.html)

On the 15th and 16 of September 2011, following the oSC, the marketing team held a
      Marketing Hackfest at the SUSE headquarters in Nuremberg, Germany. 

I was asked to attend this event for several reasons aside from the normal Marketing
      related things, two of which were the most important to me being new to this event. One, was
      to observe how the marketing team functions as a unit. And second, to hold meetings with
      different people to discuss certain issues with an outlook of solving them for the benefit of
      the openSUSE community. Moreover, many of us had a chance to further discuss (in person)
      initiatives started at the oSC, since we had a chance to digest them and come with some
      valuable input that was used to move things forward ;-)

      It's already a while ago, that we were presented with openSUSE Tumbleweed, the rolling release version of openSUSE. Also a while ago, that KDE 4.7 was released. Yet, there's still no KDE 4.7 in Tumbleweed, using the KDE:/Release: repos is not the way to go. Greg Kroah Hartman, maintainer of Tumbleweed, stated in one of the forums threads that there are some issues in KDE 4.7 that keep it from being in Tumbleweed. So, patience seems to be the best for now. Greg will probably let us know, when things get cleared.

The Internet, October 4, 2011 â€“ The Document Foundation (TDF) publishes some details of

        withheld until users have been given time to migrate to the new version.

RedHat security researcher Huzaifa Sidhpurwala identified a memory corruption
        vulnerability in the code responsible for loading Microsoft Word documents in LibreOffice.
        This flaw could have been used for nefarious purposes, such as installing viruses, through a

Following a series of embarrassing intrusions that hit the servers used to maintain and distribute the Linux operating system, project elders have advised all developers to check their Linux machines for signs of compromise.

Emails sent Friday by Linux kernel lead developers Greg Kroah-Hartman and H Peter Anvin arrived as volunteers with the open-source project worked to bring [LinuxFoundation.org](http://linuxfoundation.org/), [Linux.com](http://linux.com/), and [Kernel.org](http://kernel.org/) back online following attacks that gained root access to the multiple servers that host the sites.

Among other things, project leaders are requiring all developers to regenerate the cryptographic keys used to upload source code to the site, and to ensure their systems are free of rootkits and other types of malware.

One of the great things about the original Star Wars trilogy, was the â€œlived inâ€, junky, hacked together aesthetic of the Star Wars universe. Everything was a bit trashed, as if real people actually lived there. Thankfully, thatâ€™s one of the things that George Lucas hasnâ€™t tinkered with in his endless quest to ruin the childhood memories of a generation. So itâ€™s heartening to see this tradition carried on with the playing of the imperial death march on miscellaneous hacked together hardware. Enjoy â€¦ (...)
