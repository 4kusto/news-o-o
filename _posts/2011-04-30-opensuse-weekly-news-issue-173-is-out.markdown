[openSUSE happy to welcome 16 GSOC students!](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/04/28/opensuse-happy-to-welcome-16-gsoc-students/)

Weâ€™ve got excellent news! Weâ€™ve received many excellent submissions for our [Google Summer of Code](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GSOC_2011) application
      and Google has given us 16 slots. This means that 16 eager students have been selected and
      will start working with their mentors on an awesome openSUSE project!

According to the [GSOC
        timeline](http://www.google-melange.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2011/timeline) the students will now start with the [Community Bonding period](http://googlesummerofcode.blogspot.com/2007/04/so-what-is-this-community-bonding-all.html) in which they have time to set up their development stuff,
      get acquainted with their mentors and get to know the openSUSE community. This means weâ€™ll see
      those students on our communication channels, be it IRC, forums or mailing lists! Give them a
      warm welcome!

In a little over three weeks, the coding will start. Iâ€™m sure youâ€™re all excited to find
      out what projects these students will be working on! Well, we were too, so weâ€™ve compiled a
      nice list of the accepted proposals and asked a few students a quick quote on IRC!

[openSUSE
        11.4 DVDs for Events](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/04/26/opensuse-11-4-dvds-for-events/)

Following the huge success for filling requests of openSUSE 11.3 media in [February](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/02/18/help-the-project-spread-opensuse-dvds/), we have produced openSUSE 11.4 DVDs to distribute at events, Linux user
      groups, universities etc.

**The PromoDVDs**

These â€œPromoDVDsâ€ are meant to promote openSUSE and help users get a quick
      taste of what we have to offer. A PromoDVD is different from the usual openSUSE DVDâ€™s you can
      download from our [download portal](http://software.opensuse.org/114/en).
      They contain a reduced set of packages for installation to make room for a Live GNOME and Live
      KDE image. And the DVDâ€™s are double-sided with both 32 and 64 bit on one disc!

In some countries, where network connections are an issue, users can bring these DVDâ€™s
      from an event home for installation. In other places, the Live images and added convenience
      giving people a chance to test drive and see right away why openSUSE is a great distro for
      them!

We will have a service outage this Saturday (30 April) due to work on power supply in one
      of our server rooms. As result, the infrastructure in front of the following services will not
      be reachable on that day:

  * build.opensuse.org

  * features.opensuse.org

  * connect.opensuse.org

  * hermes.opensuse.org

  * users.opensuse.org

  * board.opensuse.org

  * conference.opensuse.org

The content on download.opensuse.org will come from a fall back system and will not get
      updated during Saturday evening.

[openSUSE Coming
        to LFNW](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/04/25/opensuse-coming-to-lfnw/)

Following in the growing list of appearances weâ€™re making worldwide, openSUSE will land in
      Bellingham, Washington for the LinuxFest Northwest conference ( LFNW ) on Saturday, April 30
      and Sunday, May 1 at the Bellingham Technical College. Weâ€™re excited to be joining in the
      festivities there, along with an exxpected attendance of over 1,000 visitors, running a booth
      and 3 presentations, doing our best to help make the event interesting and successful for
      everyone. Doing what we do best, youâ€™ll find the same great booth youâ€™ve come to expect at
      other events. There, youâ€™ll be able to pick up a DVD of openSUSE 11.4, just released last
      month amid great reviews. Youâ€™ll also be able to show your support for openSUSE and LFNW at
      the same time by buying an openSUSE T-shirt for just $5. Every dollar we make will go directly
      to supporting the great work of the LFNW crew. These FOSS events are very important to the
      community and openSUSE wants to do its part to promote that. For those of you that prefer a
      game of chance, be sure to sign up for the â€œWorld-Famousâ€ LFNW raffle; weâ€™ve donated a few
      bigger-ticket items there as well, and again, all funds support LFNW.

[Kai-Uwe Behrmann: Google Summer of Code 2011 Students](http://oyranos-cms.blogspot.com/2011/04/google-summer-of-code-2011-students.html)

Several students proposed this year to specific colour management themes. Unfortunately
      not all could be accepted for the stipends, even though the quality of the proposals where
      generally high for the themes and response was very lifely. The mentors made their decision
      and picked the following three proposals and students. 

Yiannis Belias will continue the last years project: "API stabilization for Oyranos Colour
      Management System II" for [OpenICC](http://opensuse.sf.net/) We have seen
      good progress and quite usable code during the last year period. Still there is lots to do to
      integrate and finish the code transformation. (...)

Soon we'll all hear the news on the students accepted to Google Summer of Code. I'm
      excited and I'm sure so are a lot of students! 

Once the news is in, it is time to start getting to know your mentor, getting your
      development environment up and starting to code. To help students, mentors and admins, let me
      echo a [post by Lydia

          [Aaron Seigo: First KDE Plasma Active app: Calligra office suite](http://vizzzion.org/blog/2011/04/plasma-active-a-desirable-user-experience-encompassing-the-device-spectrum/)
        

(**Note**: This post is about Plasma Active, a community
          collaboration to bring KDE software to consumer devices. To learn more about Plasma
          Active, [read this blog
            post](http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2011/04/active-routes.html).) 

Today, Plasma Active is proud to announce our first [Active
            App](http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2011/04/plasma-active-active-apps.html), or rather our first Active App suite.
          While interacting with what are generally referred to as "office documents" isn't what we
          may think of as "sexy" it's a very important set of functionality.

For Plasma Active, we've joined forces with [Calligra](http://www.calligra-suite.org/) which is a suite of office
          applications which uses the KDE Platform and has an active mobile and consumer electronics
          effort.

Calligra Active is currently in alpha, but this refers primarily to the touch
          interface. The file format compatibility with Open Document Format and Microsoft's Office
          Open XML is some of the best to be found in a mobile form factor. The Calligra team is
          currently working on a transition of the interface to QtQuick, but Plasma Active is
          already including the current mobile-targeted interface in [the
            operating system images](http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2011/04/plasma-active-operating-systems.html). (...)

I wanted to open a fate feature about this when I first heard of plymouth, but
            reading
            http://fedoramagazine.wordpress.com/2008/10/21/interview-fedora-10s-better-startup/
            really makes me think we should go this way.

Ray's comment starting with "Every flicker and mode change in the boot
            process takes away from the whole experience." is especially interesting. Is it
            okay to track the "don't show grub by default" here?

            [Update to GRUB v2 (Score: 116)](https://features.opensuse.org/308497)
          

Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn't
            going to go away. The code itself isn't well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It's only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don't have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

We need a feedback about packages that are preferred by users and actively used. Debian already has a tool named Popularity contest (popcon)

            [automated bugreporting - whole system](https://features.opensuse.org/312275)
          

It is a nasty jop to report bugs to the openSUSE bugzilla by hand.


A automated bugreporting for the whole openSUSE OS like in KDE (drkonqi) would be great.
It would save time for the user, improve the frequency of bugreports for the project(I guess many bugs donÃ‚Â´t find the way to bugzilla), and a coupling to a stacktrace or logfiles would improve the quality of the bugreports in the openSUSE bugzilla.


Good for the user, good for the quality of openSUSE, not so good for a developer(->many work:)

â€

â€œ


            [Add a 'Skip all' option to YaST's install error dialog....](https://features.opensuse.org/312276)
          

As someone whom regularly uses the KDE OBS' for latest builds, I normally run into the issue that packages are updated faster than when I apply the changes. This causes YaST to constantly pop-up that a given package could not be applied, and then a second pop-up for the action to take.


First, can we please cut this down to ONE pop-up, not two? Second, for the actions, can we please have an option to 'skip all missing packages' or the like? Obviously, this would have to warn the user that their system may be left in an inconsistent state, but I'd rather that than chasing pop-ups.

â€

â€œ


            [Include GNOME Tweak Tool](https://features.opensuse.org/312277)
          

Recently I have tried GNOME 3. There are several settings that you once could customize in GNOME 2 that you can't do in GNOME 3. There is a package called gnome-tweak-tool, that lets you customize things like the Theme again. This should be included on the distribution DVD (and perhaps Live CD too) for openSUSE 12.1.

            [Add gnome-achievements](https://features.opensuse.org/312280)
          

Hamster can use trophies from [https://github.com/tbaugis/gnome-achievements](https://github.com/tbaugis/gnome-achievements) so we probably want to take a look at packaging this.

[Bryen Yunashko: Whatâ€™s in a name?
          (Orâ€¦ What should we call the openSUSE Conference?)](http://www.bryen.com/whats-in-a-name/)

Over the past few weeks thereâ€™s been actually two threadson the openSUSE Project mailing
        list discussing what we should call the upcoming openSUSE Conference. One proposal was to
        continue with last yearâ€™s theme calling it â€œCollaboration Across Borders IIâ€
        and another calling it â€œrwxrwxrwxâ€. The other day, the program planning
        committee (including myself) took on the task of attempting to decide which one works best.
        Unfortunately, even then, we still didnâ€™t come to an easy agreement on which name to
        choose.

Both have their unique pros and cons. And ultimately whichever one we choose will impact
        how we market the conference to the world. In my opinion, both are more similar in intent
        than different, but I should probably put in a disclaimer now by mentioning that personally,
        Iâ€™m a fan of the rwxrwxrwx (or rwx3 as itâ€™s possible variation.) And yet, both will appeal
        to different sensibilities and goals of the conference as a whole. (...)

I see many people coming to the openSUSE project but only a few of them (the new people)
        actually participate in the mailing list talks and on IRC channels talks. I kept asking
        myself why? Why is this happening? Is there something wrong or what? Recently I spotted a
        new openSUSE ambassador that was too 'tight' when we were talking about community matters
        and I took the opportunity to open a conversation with him about all of the above and what I
        got from that is that people are often don't say their opinion because they fear of saying
        something wrong, also they fear on saying their different opinion when they disagree with an
        older community member and other similar situations. (...)

      [h-online/Thorsten Leemhuis: Kernel Log: Coming in 2.6.39 (Part 2) â€“ Storage and file
        systems](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-2-6-39-Part-2-Storage-and-file-systems-1232317.html)
    

**Various internal changes to the block layer that were specifically mentioned by Linus Torvalds are designed to enhance performance and scalability. The Ext4 file system is also said to offer improvements in this respect. Still classified as experimental, Btrfs now offers Batched Discard functionality, and LIO (Linux-Iscsi.org) includes a loop-back function.**

At the end of last week, Andi Kleen published a [series of patches](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1129793) that
      fixes a performance problem between the Virtual File System (VFS) and the security
      infrastructure; this was an unwanted side effect from the [optimisation to the VFS](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-2-6-38-Part-2-File-systems-1192694.html) that was merged in Linux 2.6.38. Torvalds showed [great interest](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1129793/focus%3D52980) in them and [merged one](http://git.kernel.org/linus/8c9e80ed276fc4b9c9fadf29d8bf6b3576112f1a) into the main development tree; a second fix that is based on the three patches
      from Kleen [followed on Monday](http://git.kernel.org/linus/9ade0cf440a1e5800dc68eef2e77b8d9d83a6dff) and fixes the problem in the SELinux codebase. It's still
      undecided if these or similar patches will make it into a stable kernel 2.6.38, as Torvalds
      mentioned at one point that he was considering.

Torvalds did not yet produce a fifth release candidate for Linux 2.6.39 â€“ but it should
      emerge in the next few days, as the [RC4](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1128248) is already more than
      one week old. (...)

      [Linus Torvalds: Linux 2.6.39-rc5](https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/4/27/8)
    

Another week, another keyboard destroyed by spilling coffee on it..
C'est la vie.



We have slightly fewer commits than in -rc4, which is good. At the
same time, I have to berate some people for merging some dubious
regression fixes. Sadly, the "people" I have to berate is me, because
-rc5 contains what technically _is_ a regression, but it's a
performance thing, and it's a bit scary. It's the patches from Andi
(with some editing by Eric) to make it possible to do the whole RCU
pathname walk even if you have SElinux enabled.



I've been alternately kicking myself for merging it, and just being so
pleased with the rcu pathname walk now extending outside of the
no-security confines ... I dunno. The patches are all pretty simple
(there's also a few dentry cleanup patches that were the result of me
looking at profiles and generated code), and it really is a rather
important performance thing, but at the same time I would shout at
others for trying to merge it to me this late. So I'll consider myself
properly chastised.



Other than that? We should have all the fallout from the block layer
plugging changes fixed now, and Tejun fixed the infinite CD-ROM
disk-change notification thing. So that's hopefully all good and done.



And then there are all the usual driver noise (including some hwmon
documentation), some ecryptfs and gfs2 updates and just various small
random fixups. The diffstat actually looks pretty good, most of it is
just one-liners and stuff like a few new device ID's etc.



Go forth and test,

There are so many clever ways to share photos on the Web that the idea of creating a
        static HTML photo gallery may sound positively obsolete. But in certain situations, the
        ability to turn a bunch of photos into an HTML gallery can come in rather handy. For
        starters, serving a bunch of static HTML pages is less complicated than setting up a
        dedicated photo sharing solution, which can be useful if you want to host a photo gallery on
        your own server. An HTML gallery usually requires less resources, too, so you can host it on
        modest hardware. Also, you can store an HTML gallery on a USB stick and use it as your photo
        portfolio you can display even when offline. (...)

        [LinuxJournal/Bruce Byfield: Using Styles in Scribus](http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/using-styles-scribus)
      

If you don't include master pages (which are really styles under another name), then
        Scribus supports three types of hierarchial styles: lines, character, and paragraph. As in
        any other self-respecting word processor or layout application, these styles allow you to
        apply detailed sets of formatting options quickly, without having to change each instance of
        a formatting option individually. However, styles are implemented idiosyncratically in
        Scribus, so they can take time to learn, even if you are familiar with the basic concept
        from other applications.

One of the conceptual problems you may have is that styles are defined and applied in
        different places in the editing window. To define and manage styles, you open the Style
        Manager, by selecting Edit -> Styles or pressing the F3 key. However, to apply styles,
        you either select Properties from the right-click menu of a selected object or press the F2
        key. For paragraph styles, you also have the option of selecting Edit Text from the
        right-click menu of a selected text frame, or selecting Ctrl+T to open the Story
        Editor.

Flat things are good. I'm at Tokamak 5 in Nijmegen, the KDE sprint where we plough a deep
      furrow into the future of the Free Desktop and sow KDE seeds that will grow into exciting,
      novel interfaces and make the stuff we already have even faster and more reliable. 

So what about the flat things I mentioned? We've just guzzled our way through a stack of
      pancakes of geological proportions, produced for us by pancake-flipper and KDE allrounder

      and models. We're working on several things that will make KDE on tablets as easy and fun to
      consume as Adriaan's pancakes.

"What I was proud of was that I used very few parts to build a computer that could actually speak words on a screen and type words on a keyboard and run a programming language that could play games. And I did all this myself"â€“Steve
        Wozniak

For some users computer games are little more than â€œthe things I do when I should be workingâ€, a soothing distraction or a waste of time and space. For others games
        are a matter of life and death, the bane of partners, the be all and end all of computing,
        and the reason why we bother. So the addicts are pleased to go out and buy an XBox, a
        Nintendo or a PlayStation 3 rather than a full-blown computer, and are happy to play the

The best games are a learning experience, an exercise in strategic thinking, memory
        retention, what-if scenarios and problem solving â€“ not unlike programming itself. Each piece
        in a game like chess has a limited number of moves, yet the game itself is a world of
        possibilities, and like a chess player, a programmer has to think ahead, so it isn't really
        surprising that many coders approach programming as if it was a game of chess, and are also

### Reviews and Essays

â€œ


        [Unixmen/Anuradha Shukla: When will Linux games become more mainstream?](http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/trinity-kde.html)
      

Developers are quite often gamers at heart. Until they get to core structure, there is
        no respite. Delving deep into popular games and rebuilding them are quite often the reason
        developers go on to develop the next generation of games. Linux has had quite a challenging
        history of games and their development. These are notably due to technical and practical
        reasons. While sometimes the philosophy of Open source have been the hurdle for successful
        games development.

**Linux and lack of technical framework**

Technically the lack of GPU drivers for Linux-based graphic cards, like in
        high-performing as proprietary software and the never resolving patents do put a large
        hurdle-infested road map for Linux games. Experts believe the continued failure to include
          [S3TC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S3_Texture_Compression) for open
        source OpenGL drivers as most are patent pending is creating a pseudo-scenario where distros
        are being released on the assumption that the drivers are already available. Distros without
        supporting graphic card drivers are as improper to have as a web browser without
        .jpg.

**Linux and lack of revenue generation from games**

The main belief for laxity in Linux games is that open source gaming sponsors find there
        is a lack of revenue generation as most is free software and most believe in
        doing-it-yourself philosophy. The limitation in specialized proprietary game-ware available
        currently, is that they become so niche in their genre that gamers are finding it difficult
        to port games across platforms.

**Linux overworked by licenses?**

Linux Gamers have a choice between choosing limited digitally licensed games that allow
        games to be installed on several systems and open source fee games. But again, the buck
        stops why are they not as powerful or as overwhelming as MMORG games and their ilk, given
        that Linux offers such fantastic scope for similar gaming ecosystems. Grapple is one of the
        free software projects, which is bundled with the Linux Game Publishing. It offers
        multiplayer opportunities and applications development.

**Trend towards Linux game change **

Analysts are now pinning down on new trends of platform confining proprietary games.
        Purist gamers believe cross-platform gaming and Linux with its high degree of cross platform
        compatibility are beginning to look towards Linux for better gaming solutions.

The dichotomy in Linux games seems to have been bridged somewhat by the availability of
          [Humble Indie Bundles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humble_Indie_Bundle)
        a non-dependent video gaming line by [Wolfire Games](http://www.wolfire.com/), which are multi-platform, non-DRM and compatible with Windows, OS X as well
        as Linux. The first bundle released in the second quarter of May 2010, saw the likes of
        World of Goo, Lugaru, Penumbra, Gish and Samorost 2 as an afterthought. As the developers
        committed to offer these under open source if sales went beyond $1 million, the 1.25 million
        sales led to these games being available under the GPL license. Revenge of the Titans was
        released post better sales in Dec 2010.

Despite [World of Gooâ€™s](http://www.worldofgoo.com/) success, open
        source yet remains a high-risk option for games owners. Humble Indie Bundle has proved a
        successful model and will hopefully be the harbinger of greater, more enjoyable games on the
        open source platform.

[Linux.com/Glyn Moody: The naming of parts: Time for â€œLinux
        Insideâ€?](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/The-naming-of-parts-Time-for-Linux-Inside-1235154.html)

**Names matter in free software. Just think of the number of
          electrons that have been spilt arguing over whether it's â€œLinuxâ€ or â€œGNU/Linuxâ€.
        **

The naming of parts came up when I interviewed Linus back in 1996. I had asked him about
        his relations with Richard Stallman, and this is what Linus said:

I've had some, not very much. At first he wasn't too interested,
          because Linux was so PC-centric â€“ just two years ago, it didn't run on anything else. And
          I suspect Richard really dislikes PCs. So he wasn't really interested in that sense.
          Lately, when it's become obvious how portable it is and how well it works on other
          architectures too, I think Richard in that sense looks at Linux in a different light.
        

One problem we've had, well, problem, kind of clash of
          personalities, is that Linux has gotten so much press and GNU has gotten so little. So for
          Richard, he's not pragmatic, he really has this idealistic world-view, he'd really like
          the system to be called GNU/Linux or something like this. Personally I don't think GNU
          Linux flies as a name, it should be catchy.

But is â€œLinuxâ€ catchy? The fact that few people have heard of it outside the rather
        specialised world of free software suggests not. Indeed, far more people have probably come
        across â€œUbuntuâ€, which has taken on the role of the public face of GNU/Linux to a certain
        extent. That's good, in the sense that it has done valuable work promoting free software to
        the general public; but it's also unfortunate in that it has pushed the â€œLinuxâ€ name even
        further into the background. (...)

        intimidating, but if you spend some time with it, the payoff is heightened security and
        better control of your system.

Most people who know Linux have at least heard about SELinux. SELinux, or
        Security-Enhanced Linux, was originally developed primarily by the NSA (U.S. National
        Security Agency), as an implementation of the Flask operating system security architecture.
        Flask implements MAC (Mandatory Access Control), a means of designating what processes have
        access to what resources (be they network ports, files, and so on). A lot of work has been
        done to make SELinux as easy to use as possible, although at first glance it does look
        hideously complex.

Since 2003, SELinux has been integrated into the mainline Linux kernel, and is fully
        supported in distributions such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, CentOS, Debian
        (disabled by default), Ubuntu, openSUSE, Hardened Gentoo, and others. On Red Hat Enterprise
        Linux and Fedora, SELinux is enabled at installation.
