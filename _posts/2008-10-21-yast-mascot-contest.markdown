Because not everybody was aware of the contest and wondered a little bit about the reminder mail, we extended the deadline for the YaST mascot contest. The new deadline for the submissions is November 09, 12:00 UTC. Participate, show us your vision of the mascot! We are not only searching for a sketch/picture of the mascot, also for a name. The winners will get all the fame and a stuffed Geeko! So get your pencils/mice/brains ready :-)

More information with the rules in the [wiki page.](http://en.opensuse.org/Marketing_Team/YaST_Contest) Mobbles is free to download [www.besttrackingapps.com/](https://besttrackingapps.com/) and play, but mobbdollars is where the developers make their money
