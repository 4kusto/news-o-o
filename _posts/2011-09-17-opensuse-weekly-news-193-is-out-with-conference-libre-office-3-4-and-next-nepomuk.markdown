[Jos
        Poortvlieet: openSUSE Conference Fun!](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/09/15/opensuse-conference-fun/)

At the openSUSE conference in NÃ½rnberg almost 400 visitors have shown up for the four
      tracks of sessions about technical and community matters and the many other events and
      parties. While a longer article is coming, weâ€™d like to give a taste of the conference here!

[Greek openSUSE Ambassadors: openSUSE Conference: First Day](http://opensuseambassadors.blogspot.com/2011/09/opensuse-conference-first-day.html)

In Friday morning, at 4:50 Kostas â€œWarlordfffâ€ Koudaras , George â€œEtern4Lâ€ Bratsos,
      Eustathios â€œefagraâ€ Agrapidis and Stella â€œdifferentrealityâ€ Rouzi met in Thessalonikiâ€™s
      airport. We were about to travel to Nuremberg, Germany to go at the openSUSE Conference at
      Zentrifuge. 

After we met up at the airport we checked in and we entered the airplane. It is the first
      journey of the Greek community to a Conference like that. After two and a half hours we
      arrived at Zurich airport where we stayed for two hours waiting for the next flight to
      Nuremberg. The flight between Zurich and Nuremberg lasted half an hour an finally after 4 hour
      traveling we arrived at Nuremberg. (...)

Awesome! The sun goes up in Nuremberg... The Greek team woke up early in the morning in
      order to get ready for the first day of the conference... We had a good breakfast and we
      started heading for the Zentrifuge in order to meet the other guyz and attend the Conference.
      On our road to the openSUSE Conference we met the Chinese community and we both head to the
      conference together. When we arrived people were awesome. Everyone was there... 

The day's program was printed so we took a copy in order to see and decide which awesome
      presentations we will attend! (...)

Greek team woke up in the cloudy morning in Nuremberg. We ate our breakfast at hotel and
      we started heading to the openSUSE Conference.

We arrived a bit late but luckily they haven't started yet! There were again many
      interesting presentations among about community, distribution and about technology.
      Presentations that stood out where â€œopenSUSE Tumbleweedâ€ Mr. KH, Greg, â€œAmbassador Program:
      Current status,potential changes and improvementsâ€ by Mr. KOUDARAS, Kostas (openSUSE), Mr.
      GUPTA, Manu (openSUSE), â€œOur experience in organizing a local community: The Greek exampleâ€ by
      by Mr. KOUDARAS, Kostas (openSUSE) and â€œHow to get more Women into openSUSEâ€ by PINTSCHER,
      Lydia (KDE). Do not forget the LPI exams we had at the conference. (...)

[Kai-Uwe Behrmann: Taxi
        @ rwxÂ³](http://oyranos-cms.blogspot.com/2011/09/taxi-rwx.html)

Sebastian Oliva presented today at the openSUSE
        conference the results of his ICC Device Profile
        Repository project to his mentoring organisation as participant of the Google Summer of Code 2011 program. As profile creation is
      expensive to most users, he emphasised the importance to easily share ICC profiles among these
      users. During the summer project, which is called now [taxi,
      ](http://openicc.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=openicc/taxi;a=summary) he developed a [generic API](http://openicc.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=openicc/taxi;a=blob;f=docs/api_doc.txt) to store and obtain ICC profiles through JSON requests.

[Kai-Uwe
        Behrmann: dispcalGUI 0.7 @ rwxÂ³](http://oyranos-cms.blogspot.com/2011/09/dispcalgui-07-rwx.html)

My yesterday held workshop for calibrating and profiling monitors using
      dispcalGUI+ArgyllCMS in Nuremberg was a nice experience. Around ten people from the openSUSE
      Conference gathered, all being eager to do something for their health of colour vision. We
      wanted to create ICC device profiles and collect them for later publishing. Following is a
      small report and review from the workshop. 

We had available a i1display, a DTP94 and a i1pro as measurement devices, which no of the
      attendees owned privately. Installation on openSUSE-11.4 went pretty smooth. ArgyllCMS is in
      the multimedia:photo repository and dispcalGUI is in multimedia:color_management. Both are
      easily searchable through the http://software.opensuse.org URL. One hacker had all packages
      installed in advance and could start instantly with the i1display. With the default settings
      in dispcalGUI appeared a small terminal and required to adjust native monitor settings or
      continue with calibration. We pressed number 7 and continued with the calibration part. This
      lasted relatively long. dispcalGUI and in the background ArgyllCMS took quite some work to
      iterate over the calibration for four times with lots of "regression getting worse" style
      messages. This indicated to us, that it reached an end for improvement or the application
      where not satisfied according to each persons like. The profiling and installation finished
      after quite some time and the new calibration and profile could be used in colour managed
      applications. In Gimp the monitor profile was not used by default. The Colour Management tab
      in Gimp's preferences needs to manually enable the system profile, which is a troublesome
      exercise to figure out. Instead colour managed applications should look first at the system
      profile. Overriding the system profile by default is dangerous for a good user
      experience.

[Greek
        openSUSE Ambassadors: openSUSE Conference: Day 4](http://opensuseambassadors.blogspot.com/2011/09/opensuse-conference-day-4.html)

The Greeks woke up early today. The cloudy weather of Nuremberg didn't stopped us from
      taking the road to openSUSE Conference. We also had Lydia Pintschert of KDE keep us company
      for the way to Zentrifuge.

Today there are many interesting presentations about community tools and about new
      technologies in Linux. We started from Lydia's awesome presentation about â€œSocial skills for
      geeksâ€. After that we attended the presentation of Mr. Vogelsang, Hendrik about â€œHow to
      contribute to the openSUSE Wikiâ€ which was very interesting and we all were there get informed
      on our next community target ;). Also, we attended at the main hall the presentation of an
      important member of SUSE and openSUSE Mr. Milller Michael who told us about his experience
      with SUSE and openSUSE. After we ate, talked with people and rest ourselves we attended the
      conversation about â€œPlaying with Geeko: Contribution can be funâ€ by Koudaras, Kostas and
      Gupta, Manu where they presented to the community why and how we can contribute at the
      project.

[Andreas Jaeger: openSUSE Conference 2011 is over - Photos uploaded](http://jaegerandi.blogspot.com/2011/09/opensuse-conference-2011-is-over-photos.html)

The openSUSE conference is now over. It was a really great event and I loved to meet many
      friends in person that I have only met online before like Manu and Kostas. As one of the
      co-organizers of the event, it was a lot of work and the reward was great! I'm happy to have
      been part of such a great team organizing osc11. Yesterday and today a couple of us spend
      cleaning everything up and I'm now exhausted, so I only write this short article to point out
      the photos I've taken. More next week...

Greeks woke up earlier in order to be in time at Zentrifuge. We ate breakfast and we
      prepared ourselves for taking the road to the conference. We were a bit tired but we wanted to
      live again and again the experience of participating at the openSUSE Conference. So we took
      the metro and went at Zentrifuge.

There were many community based presentations and many technical presentations about
      Google summer of code projects and in general technologies that openSUSE uses and updates. Our
      day started by attending the conversation about â€œDo we need an ambassador mentoring program?â€
      by Koudaras, Kostas where we talked about ambassadors and how we can improve the program in
      all ways. Many people from Novel attended the presentation and integrate with ideas in order
      to help improve the program. After that, we attended â€œConnect - a social networking platform
      for the openSUSE Communityâ€ by Mr. Vogelsang, Hendrik and Rusnak, Pavol who presented us this
      new awesome community tool, how it works and how we can improve it.

I wanted to open a fate feature about this when I first heard of plymouth, but
            reading
            http://fedoramagazine.wordpress.com/2008/10/21/interview-fedora-10s-better-startup/
            really makes me think we should go this way.

Ray's comment starting with "Every flicker and mode change in the boot
            process takes away from the whole experience." is especially interesting. Is it
            okay to track the "don't show grub by default" here?

An easy way to remove Software! For example: you installed an application with "1-click install" (which will install all the packages that you need), there should be an easy way (also with 1 click) to remove what you have installed with that 1-click operation... in another words: an "1-click Uninstall" to remove installed software (dependencies and packages included).

            [Update to GRUB v2 (Score: 150)](https://features.opensuse.org/308497)
          

Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn't
            going to go away. The code itself isn't well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It's only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don't have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

Currently the documentation says that to do a distribution upgrade you should first update your software stack to the target distribution, then do a zypper dup. The software stack update can already kill your system.

zypper could allow an option that makes it first install a miniroot containing the update stack itself, then automatically switch over to the miniroot to do the "zypper dup".

          [Larry
            Finger: Weekly News for September 17](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-testing/2011-09/msg00026.html)
        

The Testing Core Team met at 17:00 UTC, September 12. Our meeting was not too long as
          most of the participants were at openSUSE Conference 2011. 

We first discussed our experiences with 12.1 MS5. I reported that I was having
          problems with the KDE plasmoid NetworkManager applet, and with systemd. As it turned out,
          I was downloading a 1751-package upgrade during the meeting, and those upgrades fixed most
          of the problems with NetworkManager. In addition, a subsequent upgrade has fixed my
          systemd problems. 

Our next topic of discussion was oSC 2011. There were back-to-back BoF sessions on
          testing, one conducted by Bernhard Wiedermann of the TCT, and the second organized by Jiri
          Slaby of SuSE. Bernhard also had a talk on "One Year of openqa.opensuse.org". The
          conference also included a talk on kernel testing, more indication of the need for
          automated testing of systems that get more and more complicated. 

We next discussed Open Bugs Day No. 3. The possible explanations for the low
          participation ranges from "looking at old bugs is not very exciting" to "it was a nice
          summer day in Germany". Whatever the cause, I hope we get a better turnout when we have an
          OBD for the bugs in 12.1. 

We then discussed the areas in 12.1 that have the greatest likelihood of causing
          problems for openSUSE users. As systemd will be the default in 12.1, it needs to be tested
          on as many of our platforms as possible. We also expect further problems with the KMS
          video drivers, particularly nouveau for the nVidia adapters. To help users, we proposed
          that "nomodeset" be a standard feature of the installation media on the Factory ML. There
          was some reluctance, but it is likely that a failsafe option will be added to the GRUB
          menus on the media. 

The next meeting of the Testing Core Team will be September 25, 2011 at 17:00 UTC on
          Channel #opensuse-testing on the Freenode IRC Network
          (irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-testing). Our preliminary agenda includes our experiences
          with 12.1 Beta, and a discussion of the Beta Pizza Party.

                [LibreOffice:Stable](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/LibreOffice:/Stable/) project.

LibreOffice 3.4 provides many interesting [features and
                fixes](http://www.libreoffice.org/download/3-4-new-features-and-fixes/). The openSUSE packages are based on
            the [LibreOffice 3.4.2

The openSUSE LO team hopes that you will be happy with this release. Though, any
            software contains bugs and we kindly ask you to [report bugs](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Bugreport_LO). It will help

[ Heh. Somewhat delayed, but I literally didn't notice that all my
outgoing email bounced for the last couple of days, so here it is
again. Originally *meant* to be sent on Monday, just apparently never
got anywhere. So when it says "I should have done this yesterday", it
actually *means* Sunday ;^]

So I should have done this yesterday, but I was distracted. So here it
is, a day late:

git://github.com/torvalds/linux.git

with just over a hundred commits. It's been fairly quiet.

Some arm and openrisc updates, various small driver fixes (the drm
nvidia fixes might be the ones most noticeable to people), and some
fuse, 9p and btrfs updates for filesystems.

Nothing really stands out. Have at it, and let us know of any
outstanding regressions. (...)

        [Dedoimedo: How to install the Nvidia proprietary driver in openSUSE](http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/opensuse-nvidia.html)
      

This is not a new topic. We talked about it at least two or three times before, in my
        original openSUSE 11 review and tutorial, then again in the [openSUSE 11.X](http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/opensuse-11sp4-kde.html)
        articles. Still, it was more sort of a reference rather than a proper step-by-step guide.
        Indeed, the graphics driver installation,Ã½even though it's fairly simple, is not trivial. To
        remove all and any doubt, I decided to write this tutorial. 

We will dabble in Yast, learn how to handle repositories, add the Nvidia source,
        install the correct driver and test the installation. We'll also recall how the installation
        used to be done in the past and what some other distributions offer. Follow me. (...)

**Editors Note**: This Howto doesn't work with the
        Tumbleweed Kernel. In this case you must install the *.run File from the NVIDIA Page.

        [Wazi/Juliet Kemp: Create Your Own Syntax Highlighting in Vim](http://olex.openlogic.com/wazi/2011/create-your-own-syntax-highlighting-in-vim/)
      

In text editors like [Vim](http://olex.openlogic.com/packages/vim), syntax highlighting is the feature that shows defined components in different colors depending on their functions in the file. Vim has code syntax highlighting already available for a huge array of programming languages, including [PHP](http://olex.openlogic.com/packages/php), [Python](http://olex.openlogic.com/packages/python), HTML, [Ruby](http://olex.openlogic.com/packages/ruby), JavaScript, and more, and most of them are installed by default in the $VIM/syntax/ directory, so in most cases you can just open up your source code files and see different parts appropriately color-coded. But what if youâ€™re using a little-known language that doesnâ€™t have a preinstalled syntax file? Or if youâ€™re working with a different type of file altogether and want to create syntax highlighting from scratch? This tutorial shows how easy and even fun it is to write your own syntax highlighting rules for Vim. (...)

        [BashShell.net/Mike: String Matches in Regular Expressions](http://bashshell.net/regular-expressions/string-matches-in-regular-expressions/)
      

The parentheses allows you to use regular expressions to perform string matches, or matches to actual words.   Thus you may write a search that is looking for â€œvirtualâ€ or â€œmainâ€ with (virtual|mail).  Note they are separated by a pipe.  These are string searches so you are looking for â€œvirtualâ€ not â€œvâ€ or â€œiâ€ or â€œrâ€ etc. (...)

        [Linux Journal/Joey Bernard: Parallel Programming Crash Course](http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/parallel-programming-crash-course)
      

I've been covering various scientific programs the past few months, but sometimes it's hard to find a package that does what you need. In those cases, you need to go ahead and write your own code. When you are involved with heavy-duty scientific computing, you usually need to go to parallel computing in order to get the runtimes down to something reasonable. This month, I give a crash course in parallel programming so you can get a feel for what is involved. (...)

[Matthias Hopf: XDC: How to bring in
        more contributors](http://emmes.livejournal.com/10733.html)

In my talk (or rather: structured discussion) "[Methods of Attraction: How to bring
        in new contributors](http://www.mshopf.de/pub/XDC_11_contributors.pdf)" on this year's [X.org Developer's Conference](http://www.x.org/wiki/Events/XDC2011/Program) I
      brought up reasons why open source projects often fail to attract new contributors, and some
      changes to help this.

During the discussion it turns out that for X.org the changes are either very non-trivial, or (better) somewhat implemented already (like
      the list of low hanging fruits, which basically boils down to our [ToDo list](http://wiki.x.org/wiki/ToDo) and the [Janitor subproject](http://wiki.x.org/wiki/Development/Janitor)).

I didn't really expect any direct outcome from this discussion (as it's more like a meta
      discussion because we need to understand the real issues first), but I think it was fruitful
      especially in keeping everybody aware of the situation. (...)

      [How to prevent system-(over)writes to customized /etc/sysconfig/* files?](http://forums.opensuse.org/english/get-technical-help-here/applications/464824-how-prevent-system-over-writes-customized-etc-sysconfig-files.html)
    


      The title is clear, this thread means to find a solution for overwriting of modified system config files during an update. Of course there are the dirty tricks, like making the files concerned read-only etc., but that's not the way it should be done; forget one, and you may find yourself in a mess. IMHO the best suggestion is not to change these files at all, but add new ones that already are called from the existing ones, Still a very interesting thread for those of us that use modified default configurations for system services like, for example, a webserver.

    [openSUSE as a corporate server](http://forums.opensuse.org/english/other-forums/looking-something-other-than-support/465296-re-opensuse-corporate-server.html)
    


      Question in this thread is whether this can be done: using openSUSE as a corporate server. Of course there's the suggestion to use SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, but personally I have no hesitations to reply with a full "yes' and add that openSUSE can be used for the desktops connecting to the server as well. Read on, if you're interested in moving to an openSUSE based network for your company or organization.

      Today's world of computing is changing. Not only do we interact with social networks from our desktops, the way we control our actions changes as well. A good example is the touch screen for desktops/laptops as an input method. Not new -they've been out there for a couple of years already-, but these screens used to be quite expensive. With that changing, touch screens will become more common. Do they work on linux? They should, but here's a thread where original poster has difficulties in getting it to work properly.

        [The Document Foundation Blog/Florian Effenberger: LibreOffice launches extension and templates repository for public beta test](http://blog.documentfoundation.org/2011/09/12/libreoffice-launches-extension-and-templates-repository-for-public-beta-test/)
      

Developers invited to contribute their add-ons

Community-based review process ensures quality and reliability

LibreOffice, the free office productivity suite, can be enhanced with hundreds of extensions and templates. Users can download these smart extras to improve the suiteâ€™s functionality to fit their job or hobby, and developers can easily write their own add-ons and share it with millions of users worldwide.

Since, at the moment, there is no reliable and stable source for downloading these handy add-ons, the LibreOffice community has put great efforts into launching a public repository. It does not only provide extensions and templates for LibreOffice, but also for OpenOffice.org and other compatible office suites. Users of these can benefit from the work and the commitment of our community, and are invited to have a look at recent versions of our product, which already has included has the most popular extensions, and comes with many new features.

The new site is now in public beta testing at

[http://extensions-test.libreoffice.org](http://extensions-test.libreoffice.org)

and

[http://templates-test.libreoffice.org](http://templates-test.libreoffice.org)

and has been created in cooperation with the Plone community, on whose technology it is based. To ensure the quality and reliability of the offered extensions, a community-based review process is currently set in place: Community volunteers test and review available extensions, and those meeting criteria of quality will be tagged accordingly.

          Nepomuk â€“ What Comes Next](http://trueg.wordpress.com/2011/09/16/nepomuk-what-comes-next/)
      

After a very generous start to my [fundraiser](http://trueg.wordpress.com/2011/09/13/nepomuk-fundraiser/) (thank
        you so much for your support) it is time I get into more detail about what you are actually
        supporting. Originally I wanted to do that by updating nepomuk.kde.org. I will still do that
        but it will take a little more time than anticipated. Thus, I will simply start with another
        blog post. 

Well then, apart from cleaning out the bug database at bugs.kde.org (this will be a hard
        one), continuing to support app developers with Nepomuk integration, maintaining the whole
        Nepomuk stack, [Soprano](http://soprano.sf.net), the [Shared-desktop-ontologies](http://oscaf.sf.net), and some smaller
        Nepomuk-based applications there are some very specific tasks I want to work on in the near
        future (In this case the near-future roughly spans the next half year).(...)
