[![](http://yast.github.io/assets/images/yast-logo.png)openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) had another abundant week of snapshots.

Four Tumbleweed snapshots were released since the last article and the snapshot of the week, [20160816](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-08/msg00317.html), brought users a new version of [gtk3](http://www.gtk.org/) (3.20.8). Updated in the repositories for this snapshot was an updated version of yast2-auth-client (3.3.10). [Cairo graphics](https://www.cairographics.org/download/) fixed several bugs and [Apache2](https://httpd.apache.org/) removed the omc xml config because the change log states it is “useless nowdays.”

[Snapshot 20160817](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-08/msg00320.html) has several updates for the scalable storage platform [ceph](http://ceph.com/), which added an ability to reduce the constraints on resources required to build ceph and ceph-test packages. [Git updated to version 2.9.3](https://git-scm.com/) and glib2 had several subpackages updated as did gnome-desktop. This [snapshot](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-08/msg00320.html) caused quite a bit of chatter on the openSUSE Factory mailing list and serves as a reminder for people using openSUSE Tumbleweed to subscribed to the mailing list so they are aware of the updates.

<!-- more -->The most appealing update in [snapshot 20160818](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-08/msg00353.html) was the added subpackages to libreoffice. Other noteworthy updates in the repositories for [this snapshot](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-08/msg00353.html) were grub2, libstorage and kernel-firmware version 20160804. Updates in the repositories specific to openSUSE in this snapshot were made to [snapper](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Snapper_Tutorial), [wicked](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Wicked) and [yast2](http://yast.github.io/).

The [Linux Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/) was updated to version 4.7.1 in the [20160820 snapshot](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-08/msg00415.html) along with F Virtual Window Manager2.

KDE applications 16.08.0 and glibc 2.24 are expected to come in a snapshot soon.

Kernel 4.7.2 recently entered a staged testing phase and will hopefully make it into a snapshot by next week. Hopefully it will come sooner, but since it just reached the testing phase, at this point, it is hard to tell how quickly it will arrive in a snapshot.
