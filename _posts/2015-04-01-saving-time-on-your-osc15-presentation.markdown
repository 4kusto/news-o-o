[![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/openSUSE-2015-Template.wmf_-300x225.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/openSUSE-2015-Template.wmf_.png)The openSUSE Conference starts in The Hague in one month, and for those who are planning their presentations, we thought we would save you a little bit of time by providing you a template.

Just download the template and POW! [A magic chameleon](https://progress.opensuse.org/attachments/download/1348/openSUSE%202015%20Template.odp).

For those who want to use their own template for the presentation, we kindly ask you to use the first and last slide in your presentation.

A list of presentations that have been accepted and confirmed can be found at [https://events.opensuse.org/conference/osc15/schedule](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/osc15/schedule)

Cheers and auf Wiedersehen in Den Haag.
