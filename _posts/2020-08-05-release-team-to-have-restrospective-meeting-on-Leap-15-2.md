Members of the openSUSE community will have two retrospective meeting on the release of openSUSE Leap 15.2 after receiving feedback from the [recent survey](https://news.opensuse.org/2020/07/17/release-team-asks-for-feedback-on-leap-15-2/).

The meetings are scheduled for tomorrow, Thursday, at 06:00 - 08:00 UTC and 15:00 - 17:00 UTC.

Release Manager Luboš Kocman provided a short summary about the feedback received and information about the meeting in an [email this week to the project](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2020-08/msg00035.html). 

“Thanks to everyone who participated in our openSUSE Leap 15.2 release retrospective that took place on [survey.opensuse.org](https://survey.opensuse.org/),” Kocman wrote. “The survey was fully anonymous and questions were: What went well and What didn't go too well.

“We did receive about 200 responses... 623 records in total,” he wrote.

The retrospective is open for anyone who would like to attend. The two rounds of reviews will go over results and turn them into actionable items. There is also the possibility to have an additional meeting if more time is needed.

The anonymous findings can be found on [the openSUSE therpad](https://etherpad.opensuse.org/p/ReleaseEngineering-Leap-15.2-retro-20200804).

The virtual review meetings will take place at [https://meet.opensuse.org/ReleaseEngineeringMeeting](https://meet.opensuse.org/ReleaseEngineeringMeeting).
