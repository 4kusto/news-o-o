![Tumbleweed-black]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Tumbleweed-black-300x127.png)A new [GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/) for [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/)'s rolling release [Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) is scheduled to arrive soon.

Tumbleweed 20160613 snapshot will be the last snapshot to be based on GCC 5, according to the openSUSE Project's Dominique Leuenberger.

GCC 6 will become the new default compiler, but the release date of the snapshot is difficult to predict right now because Tumbleweed is competing with builds allocated for the next Alpha 2 release of [openSUSE Leap 42.2](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:42.2), which is scheduled to be release next week before the [openSUSE Conference](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC16).

Some fixes in the GCC 6 snapshot will likely be needed, so users should pay attention to the [openSUSE Factory Mailing List](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/) for any fixes that might be necessary.

Previous snapshots this week also brought some goodies in the repositories for users. [Snapshot 20160612](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-06/msg00205.html) provided [Mozilla Firefox 47.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/47.0/releasenotes/), kernel-firmware 20160609 and [AppStream](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Distributions/AppStream/) 0.9.6.

The [20160611 snapshot](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-06/msg00186.html) provided git 2.8.4 and several updated YaST packages in the repositories while [snapshot 20160609](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-06/msg00172.html) brought updates to [gstreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/), [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) (1.11.0) and autoyast2.


#### Help Test Alpha 2 Release


As for Leap 42.2, a lot of focus was made on systemd and GNOME for the Alpha 2 release. Once Alpha 2 is released, we encourage people to test it and get involved with the development on the [openSUSE Factory Mailing List](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/).
