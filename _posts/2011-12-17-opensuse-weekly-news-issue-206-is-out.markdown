[FOSDEM12 Cross-Distribution Devroom: (Last) Call for Participation](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/12/16/fosdem12-cross-distribution-devroom-last-call-for-participation/)

FOSDEM is the biggest event organized by and for the Free and Open Source (FOSS)
      community. Its goal is to provide developers a place to meet, come together and share and
      discuss ideas. The event happens 4-5 February 2012 in Brussels, Belgium. And there will again
      be a cross-distribution mini conference at FOSDEM this year. By organizing a mini conference
      where all distributions participate in we foster collaboration and cross pollination. You are
      hereby invited to hold a session.

If youâ€™re interested let your intention be known on the `<[distributions@lists.fosdem.org](mailto:distributions@lists.fosdem.org)>` mailinglist,
      with the following information and we will factor in your contribution.

New DB2 appliances are now available in SUSE Gallery, as seen in the [search results](http://susestudio.com/search?q=db2) shown below.

For quite some time the DB2 Express-C appliances ([32-bit](http://susestudio.com/a/X2kjL8/ibm-db2-express-c-975-sles11-sp1-32-bit), [64-bit](http://susestudio.com/a/X2kjL8/ibm-db2-express-c-975-sles11-sp1-64-bit)) have been available in SUSE Gallery. Without any publicity, these
        appliances have been found by a relatively large number of Gallery users, who have
        downloaded or cloned these to build new appliances. The great thing about these appliances
        is that they are published by [IBM](http://ibm.com/). (...)

[Uwe Gansert: SUSE Studio Images in SUSE
          Manager](http://suse.gansert.net/?p=387)

Today our SUSE Appliance Workshop week ended, so I want to write down a little bit of
        what we did this week. â€œWeâ€ means a teammate of mine
        (Johannes Renner) and I continued our work on the [SUSE
          Studio](http://studio.suse.com) integration into SUSE Manager. We started that with a slightly bigger team
        at the workshop 6 month ago but with the end of this AWS, we have reached a state where we
        want to present it to the public (thatâ€™s you ![](http://suse.gansert.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif) ).

As you might already know, you can create virtual machines with SUSE Manager by
        installing them with AutoYaST or Kickstart on a virtual host.

We thought, we have this really great SUSE Studio, where you can build VM images very
        quickly, so why not using SUSE Manager to deploy those Studio images? So here is what we
        did.

            [Look at plymouth for splash during boot (Score: 210)](https://features.opensuse.org/305493)
          

I wanted to open a fate feature about this when I first heard of plymouth, but
            reading
            http://fedoramagazine.wordpress.com/2008/10/21/interview-fedora-10s-better-startup/
            really makes me think we should go this way.

Ray's comment starting with "Every flicker and mode change in the boot
            process takes away from the whole experience." is especially interesting. Is it
            okay to track the "don't show grub by default" here?

            [1-click uninstall (Score: 177)](https://features.opensuse.org/305305)
          

An easy way to remove Software! For example: you installed an application with "1-click install" (which will install all the packages that you need), there should be an easy way (also with 1 click) to remove what you have installed with that 1-click operation... in another words: an "1-click Uninstall" to remove installed software (dependencies and packages included).

            [Update to GRUB v2 (Score: 173)](https://features.opensuse.org/308497)
          

Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn't
            going to go away. The code itself isn't well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It's only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don't have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

            [Graphics Repository](https://features.opensuse.org/313086)
          

I enjoy using openSUSE to work on both 2D and 3D graphics. However sometimes it's hard to keep up with the current versions of the popular applications. For example the latest versions of Blender, Inkscape or MyPaint is usually worth upgrading.
So I thought it'd be very cool for graphic enthusiasts to have a single official repository with the latest versions of the most popular graphic applications for the current versions of openSUSE so that it's easy to install them.

          [Larry
            Finger: Weekly News for December 17](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-testing/2011-12/msg00005.html)
        

The Testing Core Team held a meeting on Monday, December 12, 2011 at 18:00 UTC on
          Channel #opensuse-testing on the Freenode IRC Network
          (irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-testing). 

For most of the meeting, we discussed the openSUSE 12.1 release cycle. The full
          transcript of the meeting is found at [http://tinyurl.com/cnog4af](http://tinyurl.com/cnog4af), but we agreed that too many bugs make it into the
          released version. Our discussion centered around two main points. 

1. Many people do not start testing until RC1 or RC2 are released; however, by then
          there is too little time for the bugs to be fixed. For 12.1, this problem was worse due to
          the late release of some of the milestones, which made the RC cycle shorter than it
          usually will be. 

2. Not all testers actually file bug reports. The cause may be that they find the
          whole process to be too difficult, or they do not think it is worth the effort. Perhaps
          the time between bug filing and the assignment is too long. 

We also discussed the art work for a new release. It is common for the final version
          of the graphics to become ready late in the cycle, which means that for much of the
          testing, it is impossible to distinguish at a glance what version is running. 

If anyone has any suggestions on how we can get more testers involved at an earlier
          stage, or any other ideas on how testing can be improved, please send them to us.
          Remember, it is only about a month until 12.2 MS1 is released. As it is likely that
          SystemV will disappear in 12.2, it is critical that your systemd issues be resolved before
          August when the final version of 12.2 is released. A testing version of systemd (37-317.1
          from OBS) has fixed my one system that failed to boot with systemd. 

The next meeting of the TCT will be on Monday, January 16, 2012 at 18:00 UTC on
          Channel #opensuse-testing on the Freenode IRC Network
          (irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-testing).

      [Linus Torvalds: Linux 3.2-rc5](https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/12/9/419)
    

It's been a bit over a week, and I'm sad to report that -rc5 is bigger
(at least in number of commits - most of the commits are pretty small,
so it's possible that the *diff* ends up being smaller, but I didn't
check) than both -rc2 and -rc4 were.

So much for "calming down".

Yeah, part of it is probably that Ingo is back, and had a backlog
(mainly x86 and perf). But quite frankly, that isn't enough to explain
it all - we have xfs and btrfs changes, we have network updates, and
we have the usual 50% random driver updates (sound, target and gpu
drivers stand out, but there's some network amd MD driver noise too). (...)

**Changes to the memory subsystem promise improved response times and performance. From Linux 3.2, device-mapper supports thin provisioning and is able to use this ability for improved snapshot functionality.**

Just before last weekend, Linus Torvalds [released](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1227209) the fifth
      pre-release version of Linux 3.2. In his release email, he expressed some disappointment about
      the increase in commits since RC4 compared to the second and fourth release candidates.
      Torvalds says that there' "nothing really scary" in RC5, noting that the
      changes tend "to be pretty small, and many of them are solid regression
      fixes"

Torvalds has not yet given any indication of an expected release date for kernel 3.2. But, with many kernel developers away from their keyboards over the Christmas and New Year period, to avoid having the Linux 3.3 merge window fall within this period, the next major Linux version is unlikely to be released before early January. The Kernel Log will nonetheless complete the "Coming in 3.2" series before Christmas. Following articles on new features in the areas of [network drivers and infrastructure](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-3-2-Part-1-Networking-1379085.html), [filesystems](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-3-2-Part-2-Filesystems-1387311.html) and [architecture and processor support](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-3-2-Part-3-Architecture-1390730.html), this article is concerned with other kernel infrastructure.

        [Wazi/Rares Aioanei: Getting Started with Mercurial](http://olex.openlogic.com/wazi/2011/getting-started-with-mercurial/)
      

The version control system (VCS) debate is one of the less heated â€œholy warsâ€ in the Linux/Unix world. Most of the conversation revolves around [Git](http://olex.openlogic.com/packages/git) vs. [Subversion](http://olex.openlogic.com/packages/subversion) vs. [CVS](http://olex.openlogic.com/packages/cvs), but other systems may be a better fit for your needs. For instance, [Mercurial](http://olex.openlogic.com/packages/mercurial) is written in [Python](http://olex.openlogic.com/packages/python) and C, which makes it easily hackable if you need some functionality the project doesnâ€™t offer already. Itâ€™s also fast. And it has other advantages that make it the choice of popular open source projects such as Mozilla, [OpenOffice.org](http://olex.openlogic.com/packages/openoffice), [Dovecot](http://olex.openlogic.com/packages/dovecot) and [Vim](http://olex.openlogic.com/packages/vim).

I read [somewhere](http://importantshock.wordpress.com/2008/08/07/git-vs-mercurial/) an interesting comparison that said â€œGit is McGyver, Mercurial is James Bondâ€; in other words, while Git is a collection of tools like git-pull, git-merge, and git-checkout that do most everything except repair your sink, Mercurial is one thing, does one thing, and does it well. And itâ€™s easy to learn, too. (...)

        [Home ERA Computers & Consulting: Linux XFS Defragmentation](http://www.eracc.com/content/linux-xfs-defragmentation)
      

There is a lot of debate over whether or not one should defragment file systems on Linux. Frankly, in most cases fragmentation of Linux file systems is probably not a problem. However, in a very few cases fragmentation might be a problem. When such a scenario has arisen is up to the reader of this article to decide. Recently here at ERACC we experienced access / speed degradation of the XFS file system on a heavily used /home partition. Part of the problem was that the file system was over 90% full. Another part of the problem was when we checked it with xfs_db the file system was roughly 20% fragmented. Besides cleaning up the file system by deleting and archiving old data from user's directories, we came up with a defragmenation strategy for the entire server. This script is the result: (...)

  * Dual-core 1.2 GHz ARMÃ½ Cortexâ„¢-A9 MPCoreâ„¢ (OMAP4460) with SMP from Texas
            Instruments

  * provides 25% increase in graphics performance over OMAP4430 (but use a Imagination
            Technologiesâ€™ POWERVRâ„¢ SGX540 graphics core as the PandaBoard)

  * DSI Support

  * Bluetooth Low Energy Capable

  * Sysboot switch available on board

The rest of the board should be the same as on the OMAP4430 based PandaBoard.

      honor _ICC_PROFILE X11 atoms. It affects all X11 builds and inhibits automatic selection of
      the system ICC monitor profile. A properly detected system monitor profile in Firefox will
      show default sRGB colours as well as images with ICC profiles much more in line with other

Some colleagues told me they have only ~750 MByte RAM available on their PandaBoards. So I
      checked my PandaBoard ES and it was the same there. As first I tried to set mem=1024M in
      boot.scr, but this didn't help. After some research I found that our kernel from the
      openSUSE:Factory:ARM repository wasn't build with HIGHMEM support. But the kernel need
      HIGHMEM-support to access the memory above 768MB on ARM/OMAP. 

I changed the kernel config for the omap2plus package and build a new kernel RPM locally. 

As soon as I installed the new kernel and rebooted, I got
      this:

root@pandboardES:/ # free 
             total  used   free shared buffers cached
Mem:       1010680 54604 956076      0    3516  29384
-/+ buffers/cache: 21704 988976
Swap:            0     0      0

I'll submit a new kernel package, but for now you can get the RPMs [here](http://beta.suse.com/private/dkukawka/pandaboardES/).

Among organizations that favor closed technology development, DARPA would have to qualify as one of the most traditionally closed outfits of all. The United States' Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency routinely pops up with new inventions, many of which would impress James Bond, but the inventions are typically shrouded in secrecy and mystery until they arrive. After all, lots of them are intended for battlefields, where the element of surprise can matter a lot. But Ars Technica reports that DARPA is exploring some new technology development models, including embracing open source principles. This makes a lot of sense. (...)

The libbluray project put out its first official release a few weeks ago. This open-source (GNU GPLv2) library is intended to support Blu-Ray disc playback by media players such as VLC and MPlayer.

The libbluray 0.21 release is the first from the project and it happened on the 30th of November. This release hasn't been widely publicized and I just happened to know about it this morning from an indirectly-related message on another mailing list. This project was born out of the Doom9 community and has been under development since 2009.

There aren't many details on the 0.21 release but the VLC announcement simply states: "VideoLAN and the libbluray developers would like to present the first official release of their library to help playback of Blu-Ray for open source systems." (There also isn't any change-log or useful documentation distributed with the libbluray package.)

Well, here we are, another year almost done for. Time to look back and take stock of the year that was. You know what? It turns out that 2011 was a banner year for open source projects. So much so, that picking the 10 most important was pretty difficult.

So what do I mean by "important," anyway? Clearly, it's not just projects that are widely used. That list would be just too long to even contemplate. You'd have to include Apache, GCC, X.org, Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, Linux Mint, not to mention a bazillion and one libraries and utilities that we depend on every day.

So to judge importance, I looked at projects that are influential, gaining in popularity, and/or technical standouts in new areas. In other words, projects that are even more noteworthy than the other noteworthy projects. This means that many projects that are crucial didn't make the list. And now, in no particular order, the 10 most important projects of 2011. (...)

It's been a long, strange trip for SUSE. What started in 1992 as a small German company (SUSE was an acronym derived from "Software und System Entwicklung," or "software and systems development") with a derivative of [Slackware Linux](http://www.slackware.com/) became a mighty Linux distribution in its own right. Money problems led to a sale to Novell in 2003, which had its own share of troubles.

Finally [Novell was sold to Attachmate](http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2010/11/novell-attachmate.php) in a deal that closed in April of this year. Attachmate then decided to spin SUSE off into its own business, and tapped Nils Brauckmann as president and general manager of the unit.

To get a sense what SUSE is in for in 2012, I talked to Brauckmann this morning. Brauckmann's involvement with SUSE started with Attachmate's purchase, so the first time we spoke was earlier this year just after he took over the role. This time I found him much readier to discuss details of the SUSE strategy, if not every minor product detail. (...)
