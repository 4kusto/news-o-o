[![openSUSE-Education Li-f-e CD](https://en.opensuse.org/images/6/65/Edu-suse_life-cd.png)](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e)This time others are faster than the original source: [Softpedia](http://linux.softpedia.com/get/System/Operating-Systems/Linux-Distributions/openSUSE-Edu-Li-f-e-52361.shtml) as well as [Distrowatch](http://distrowatch.com/) already announced the new openSUSE-Education release 13.2.1, which is based on openSUSE 13.2.

While openSUSE-Education 13.1 had over 20,000 downloads alone via [Souceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opensuse-edu/) (which is one of our largest mirrors) and the fact that many people seem to watch our activities so actively that they even know before any official announcement that there is “something new” is heartwarming crazy. To use marketing speak, openSUSE-Education is the most comprehensive Linux distribution for Education and Home use right now. …and now you can even download the most current release based on one of the best Open Source Distributions in the world!

This time we also provide 32bit and 64bit based Li-f-e ISO images - just have a look at our [wiki page](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e) and choose the one you like most. Download and spread this awesomeness around this festive season.

Both ISOs contain the greatest and latest software available for openSUSE - including not only educational but also multimedia and many other useful software.
