Just in time for the KDE 4.0.1 release, the openSUSE KDE team has updated the KDE 4 packages in the Build Service to the KDE 4.0.1 state, featuring several improvements over the plain KDE 4.0.1 release and including further integration fixes.



### KDE Four Live 1.0.1



[KDE Four Live](http://home.kde.org/~binner/kde-four-live/), the openSUSE KDE4 Installable Live CD, has also been updated to contain these packages and changes.

#### KDE Repository Re-structuring



After a long discussion and feedback period, the openSUSE BuildService repository layout for KDE packages has finally [been overhauled](http://en.opensuse.org/KDE/Repositories).

There are: latest, stable and regularly updated KDE 4.0.x packages as well as experimental KDE 4.1 packages available. The repositories are kept in a modular state so you can choose how much of your system you want to be possibly affected by selecting one of the stable or unstable Desktop, Extra or Community repositories. As a result, **the current KDE:KDE4 repository has now been frozen and will be removed in the future**, so please update your repositories accordingly.

Of course the _Backports_ and _KDE3_ repositories, which do not update any of your system libraries, are still available and will be extended even further in the near future.
