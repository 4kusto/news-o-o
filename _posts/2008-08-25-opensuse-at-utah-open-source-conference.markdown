As part of Hack Week, [we'll also have a room set aside for Hack Week III participants](http://blog.utos.org/2008/08/19/novell-hack-week-coming-to-utosc-2008/), so you can watch the hacking in real time.

The schedule runs from 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. local time Thursday and Friday, and from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
