![](/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/promo_dvd.png)One of the easiest things to do to contribute to the free and open source movement and the openSUSE Project is to exercise your second free software freedom: [The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)

To be able to do this comfortably the openSUSE Project, with the help of its [sponsors](http://en.opensuse.org/Sponsors), produces special promotional DVDs that contain live versions of both the KDE and GNOME desktops to try and which can also be used to install the a complete system. Those DVDs are perfect for introducing people to Linux and openSUSE. The openSUSE version included, [11.3](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:11.3), has all the qualities a newcomer wants. It's a mature multi-purpose Linux operating system widespread among the free and open source software community for great user to user support. It comes with more with than 1,000 open source desktop applications, a full suite of server software and a rich selection of open source development tools.

So today the openSUSE Project would like to encourage you make use of your second free software freedom and help us to spread promo DVDs! It's easy, think about where you could have the chance to spread them, then order them from us and do it. How about you putting them out in your local community centre, you give some to the computer science teacher of your daughter's school or how about the guys that operate your universityâ€™s support desk? The clubhouse of your football club? The next concert or other event you attend or maybe on the toilet in your cousin's bar? The internet cafÃ© around the corner for sure! The possibilities are endless. If you think you know a place where people pick them up and try them, go for it! Helping us is as simple as ordering DVDs from us and going out to talk to the venues if you can leave a couple of them. You would be surprised how many people find a nice, shiny, green openSUSE DVD interesting enough to finally try this Linux thing they heard about so much on the internet.

So if you can think of anything just contact us about the amount you need (multiplies of 100 please) and where we need to send them. For this just send an email to


[promodvds@opensuse.org](mailto:promodvds@opensuse.org)


Don't be shy about the amount, we don't need to scrimp on them! If you think you can get spread 500 we'll send you 500. Every DVD that is out there, is out there and might result in a new free and open source software and openSUSE user. This is the perfect opportunity to do something good for free and open source software and the openSUSE project, take it!

**Update 2010-02-21: **We received so many requests that we expect we have more requests than media, therefore please do not send further requests.
