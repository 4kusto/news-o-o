[openSUSE Members](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Members) should have received an email from the openSUSE Election Officials with a link and Election Fingerprint to cast their ballot on April 15.

The platform gives three steps for voting like selecting the candidates, reviewing and confirming the voterâ€™s choices for the board and the final step of submitting the encrypted ballot.

Those three candidates that are elected to the position will serve a 24-month term.
