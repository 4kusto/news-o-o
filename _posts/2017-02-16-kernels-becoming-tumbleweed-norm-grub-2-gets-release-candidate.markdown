![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Tumbleweed-black-green-300x127.png)Two [Linux Kernels](https://www.kernel.org/) per week in [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) is becoming the norm as the rolling release is providing daily snapshots of new software that are closely aligned with upstream development.

Kernel 4.9.8 and 4.9.9 were released in the [20170208](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2017-02/msg00252.html) and [20170212](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2017-02/msg00381.html) snapshots respectively and the later brought a fix for a [Btrfs](https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page) system call.

Beside the 4.9.8 Kernel in the first week’s snapshot, [20170208](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2017-02/msg00252.html), [Mesa](https://mesa3d.org/) users will be happy to see version 13.0.4 had a specfile fix for build configuration for [ARM](https://www.arm.com/), [Power PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC) and [s390](http://linux.s390.org/) architectures. [Gimp 2.8.20](https://www.gimp.org/news/2017/02/01/gimp-2-8-20-released/) made the color selection of the paint tool more robust and updated translations for a number of European languages. Several other packages were updated in the repositories from this snapshot and python3-kiwi 9.0.2 and [vim 8.0.311](http://usevim.com/2016/09/12/vim-8-0) provided the most fixes.

Snapshot [20170209](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2017-02/msg00303.html) brought the first major release of [libosinfo](https://libosinfo.org/) (Operating System information database) in Tumbleweed with version 1.0.0, which focuses on metadata about operating systems and provides a single place to manage it in a virtualized environment.  F Virtual Window Manager (FVWM) 2.6.7 added a handful of new features and removed several other features like  GTK 1.x support.

[Plasma 5.9.1](https://community.kde.org/Schedules/Plasma_5) came in the [20170211](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2017-02/msg00342.html) snapshot and [AppArmor 2.11.0](https://launchpad.net/apparmor/+milestone/2.11) update provided multiple [improvements and fixes](http://wiki.apparmor.net/index.php/ReleaseNotes_2_11), one of which fixed an issue that Kernel 4.8 and above affected Apparmor policy enforcement. Libssh hackers made use of their time at [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2017/) and squashed bugs, which came in the [libssh 0.7.4](https://www.libssh.org/2017/02/03/libssh-0-7-4/).<!-- more -->

Both [20170213](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2017-02/msg00414.html) and [20170214](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2017-02/msg00449.html) snapshots provided updates for [KDE Applications 16.12.2](https://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-applications-16.12.2.php). [GNU Compiler Collection 6.3.1](https://gcc.gnu.org/) provides from architectural fixes and grub2 now has a Release Candidate 1, which came in the most recent snapshot.
