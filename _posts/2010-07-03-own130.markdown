     We are pleased to announce our **130** issue of the [openSUSE  Weekly News](http://wiki.opensuse.org/Weekly_news). 
Every day our counter goes one day more to 0. We have seen our  Milestones and our RC1. Last days RC2 was released, so our last Snapshot  is online. Everone is invited to test it, and sure to write Bugreports.  In a few day we recieve our Goldmaster. The goldmaster is that Build  who is used by pressing the CDs and DVDs, If the Build is outside, no  changes going to the Medias. From this Point on we can recieve updates  just via YaST/Zypper.  So i would like to invite you all to test the RC2. :-)

An other interesting thing in this Issue is the new founded Group  "Women of openSUSE". If you are a Woman, just join the Group.

That was all for this Issue's Editors Note...



     We hope that you will enjoy reading.

     "Following up on Michael Loeffler’s previous RC1 announcement,  openSUSE is now doing a final check of instrumentation before landing.   The weather continues to be clear and all conditions continue to be  smooth, and all systems are a go for final landing on July 15, 2010.   Now’s the time for us all to download the latest openSUSE RC2 release  and all join in on a final check and get that 11.3 polished and in good  condition.  You can download RC2 from our software portal and find  detailed information on the evolving openSUSE 11.3 page. 
     You can find our most annoying bugs here.  And if you find  anything new, please do report it on Bugzilla.  The ground crew needs  your reports! 
     Have a lot of fun and let’s get to downloading!  They’re  waiting to greet us at the terminal." 



#### [opensuse-community.org an attack page](http://dev-loki.blogspot.com/2010/07/opensuse-communityorg-attack-page.html)




     "Apparently, the wiki on our opensuse-community.org website has  been compromised. At least, [so says Google](http://safebrowsing.clients.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?client=Firefox&hl=en-US&site=http://packages.opensuse-community.org/) ;) 
     Well yeah, the blame is on me, the Mediawiki instance there is  really, really outdated and I didn't keep up with security patches and  upgrades. Sorry about that. 
     I just spent a night installing the most recent Mediawiki  version on another server (the one hosting the whole opensu.se sites),  and moving over the content (I didn't keep the history though, we hardly  need it). 
     Until the DNS entry of opensuse-community.org is transferred  to the other IP address, I've put a global URL forward to [w.opensu.se](http://w.opensu.se/)." 



#### [openSUSE India IRC Channel LIVE !](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-announce/2010-07/msg00002.html)




     "This is to notify all Lizards ;-) (openSUSE Lovers) that the  openSUSE India Channel on IRC Freenode--> #opensuse-in , is now Live  and registered . So if you have something to ask, share or want to spend  some time with openSUSE Indian users , do visit :-)" 



#### [openSUSE Forums – vBulletin Upgrade Complete](../2010/07/01/opensuse-forums-vbulletin-upgrade-complete/)




    "The vBulletin software that is the ‘Nuts and Bolts’ behind the  openSUSE Forum has just undergone a major upgrade from v3 to v4. This  resulted in some considerable down time on 30 June 2010. However, the  results are impressive and openSUSE Forums now has a completely new  look. It’s more than that though, the upgrade adds a much improved look  and feel. The Forum Team expect some teething problems, as well as much  discussion and opinion about the change. As far as changes go, I’d put  this on a par with the kde move from 3 to 4. The dust will settle soon  enough. Be assured the Forum Staff will be ready and willing to offer  advice and assistance relating to this and of course normal help/advice  with openSUSE."

#### [Duncan Mac-Vicar: openSUSE Build Service on Android](http://duncan.mac-vicar.com/blog/archives/724#utm_source=feed&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=feed)




     "Release fast, release early. That is what I am trying this  time so don’t get too excited. I only added one feature. Yes one. 
     You can list the pending submit requests related to you.  Nothing else. And not with a very pretty layout :-) but it will get  better. 
     However, I have an infrastructure in place that will allow me  to consume the API very easily, and I will push new versions every time I  add something." 



#### [Stephan Kulow: Buildservice development on 11.3](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/06/26/buildservice-development-on-11-3/)




     "The build service (and any other of openSUSE infrastructure  software using RoR) is using rails 2.3.5, because we once decided to  harmonize on the version of SLE11 SP1. Of course the latest version has  less bugs (usually), but mixing RoR versions between different  developers and deployment is a nightmare, so we had to decide on one. 
     Now comes the catch: 11.3 has rails 2.3.8 and as such you  can’t develop the build service on factory/11.3 as is. But the good  news, openSUSE:Tools has all the right versions, so you can add the repo  (zypper ar -r [http://r.opensu.se/openSUSE:Tools/f/r](http://r.opensu.se/openSUSE:Tools/f/r)) and then  install zypper in -f rubygem-rack-1.0.1 rubygem-activesupport-2_3-2.3.5"

#### [Raymond Wooninck: KDE SC 4.5 rc1 available for openSUSE](http://tittiatcoke.wordpress.com/2010/06/28/kde-sc-4-5-rc1-available-for-opensuse/)




     "Since yesterday evening the openSUSE KDE4:Unstable  repositories contains the KDE SC 4.5 rc1 packages. Also the special  repository that contains KDEPIM 4.5 snapshots, was updated to a version  that seems to work pretty well. 
     I am not using IMAP, so I can’t comment on it’s status. But  the POP accounts are working very well and also filtering is active. At  least it allowed me to move away again from Thunderbird to this Kmail v2  solution. A very good job done by the KDEPIM developers!!" 



#### [KDE at openSUSE: KDE: Week 24+25](http://kdeatopensuse.wordpress.com/2010/06/27/kde-week-2425/)




     "There was not much to report last week thus I skipped the blog  post.  No issues with KDE and no IRC meeting either. This week’s IRC  meeting took quite long since we had to discuss the KDE repository  reorganisation. We did not finish yet but decisions already taken will  be posted to the opensuse-kde@ mailinglist soon. 
     IMHO renaming URLs will not solve the issue of users getting  their information off some forum and mailinglists and thus ending-up  with a wild mix of Qt and KDE repos and wondering why their KDE repo  suddenly becomes WIP since they are using Factory. Although everything  is written out nicely on the openSUSE wiki, most people still did not  get the different usage of the term STABLE within the last years. The  STABLE repo always contained the packages released with the last  openSUSE version plus official openSUSE updates, i.e. “stable openSUSE  KDE” rather than “stable KDE for openSUSE”. Hence I prefer a GUI that  explains everything to and handles repos for the user, keeping him away  from URLs."

#### [#310041: HP  3D GuardDrive](https://features.opensuse.org/310041)




     "I wish openSUSE to supply a daemon, which uses the  /dev/freefall to provide hard disk head crash protection. There is an  example application in /usr/src/linux/Documentation/hwmon/hpfall.c which  might be used as a base for such a daemon and the needed modules  (hp_accel and lis3lv02d) are present in kernel 2.6.31. I think this is  an important feature for HP laptop users." 



#### [#310044: Validating DNSSEC support](https://features.opensuse.org/310044)




     "[DNSSEC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSSEC) (Domain Name System Security) is mechanism which provides integrity and  authenticity of DNS data. It became more important after new Kaminsky  DNS poisoning attacks were found in early 2008. The domain-name  organizations start to support them for regular usage. Especially: ROOT  (.) will be signed starting from July 15, 2010. ARPA is offers signing  since 17 March 2010. And several country TLD already use or have  test-bed DNSSEC implementations (e.g. .cz, .se, .ch, .de, .pm, .us,  (soon:) .eu, .fr, etc.)." 



#### [#310058: SUDO with sandbox -X integrationedit](https://features.opensuse.org/310058)




     "Fedora team have developed sandbox -X, a tool allowing to run  programs from desktop in sandbox, but still connected to X server. We  should integrate this with Sandbox -X to avoid security holes by running  some application as another user by sudo." 



#### [#310061: DE intependend dialog program](https://features.opensuse.org/310061)




     "Create dialog program with many backend: QT, GTK+, ncruses,  WxWidgets. It should prefer to communicate via terminal. Behavior could  been changed by environment, like PREFERED_UI="KDE4:GNOME" or  WINDOWMANAGER="metacity". It could also working as session deamon. Make  it also extensible, allowing to return information about supporting  feature by backend and using something similar to namespaces."

     "Just allow to connect repository/packages with apparmour  profile by vendors of package/repository." 



#### [#310069: run  yast2 second stage config in ncurses or VGA mode](https://features.opensuse.org/310069)




     "With 11.2 default installs, I have observed 3-4 installs and  2-3 of those ended with a black screen where yast2 second stage  configuration should have been. 
     The actual reasons for the black screens differed. One had an  ATI graphics driver crash and another used the maximum possible  resolution (1600x1200), which the CRT-monitor could not handle. However,  from a user perspective, this all came out to the same awful experience  - a non-working system that is giving no hint to what might be wrong.  (...)" 



#### [#310070: openSUSE support for ARM](https://features.opensuse.org/310070)




     "As indicated by [this thread](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-buildservice/2010-06/msg00293.html), and many earlier, there is demand for  openSUSE ARM support. As discussed on the mailing list: (...)"

#### Larry Finger: Weekly Review of the testing team




     "For general news about the openSUSE Testing Core Team, please  see [Team Minutes](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/04/23/guest-blog-testing-team-minutes-week-16/) and the links within it. 
     The Team held a special regular IRC meeting last Monday to  report our experiences with Factory at the half-way point between RC1  and RC2. Our hope is to find any bugs that might have been introduced in  the development, and to track the repairs on the bugs that were in RC1.  As the schedule calls for only 2 weeks between RC2 and the GM release,  there is not much time for finding and fixing bugs. 
     The Team will hold our regular meeting next Monday to discuss  our experiences with RC2. 
     At this writing, my only RC2 installation is an update from  RC1 using the NET install CD on a 32-bit virtual machine running under  VirtualBox. This update proceeded without problems. After rebooting, DNS  did not work due to a faulty resolv.conf - a condition that was logged.  It was a simple fix, but one that might be a problem for a new user."

     "The **openSUSE Women** project is a very new one. It is a  subproject of the openSUSE project. The Women of openSUSE project was  founded on Linuxtag2010. It was founded to find women, who are  interested in helping other women with technical problems, have techtalk  about different topics and to build a part of the openSUSE community  where women can think in their own ways." 



#### [Martin Vidner: Helping Newcomers](http://mvidner.blogspot.com/2010/07/helping-newcomers.html)




    "Since the discussion (do check out the linked paper, BTW) and  the opensuse-women announcement, I've been thinking about how to make  the openSUSE community more friendly to women. 
     I think one good way is to make sure that new people feel  welcome when they join a conversation, be it on the forums, on IRC or on  the mailing lists. Now this would be easier if we all had infinite time  to read and answer all questions, but as we don't, I decided to focus  somehow. 
     The forums provide a handy shortcut for the focus, labeling a  user who made few posts as a "Puzzled Penguin". So I've made a simple  service, a feed of [http://forums.opensuse.org](http://forums.opensuse.org/) showing only the posts by newcomer users: [http://vidner.net/martin/software/rss-creator-blacklist](http://vidner.net/martin/software/rss-creator-blacklist)."

    "﻿﻿﻿The Ohio Linux Fest will be on September 10-12, 2010 in  Columbus, Ohio.  There is now a one-week extension for Call for  Partiicipation. If any of you are in the Ohio area and would like to  give a talk about openSUSE, we encourage you to register your talk  proposal here."

     "It's finally time to talk about LinuxTag 2010. It was my third  time there, and this year was the best so far, at least for me! And  that's most probably because of how amazing our openSUSE booth turned  out to be! Or maybe it's because of the invasion of the Geekos? 
     **openSUSE Booth**
     We certainly didn't have a big slot for out booth, but oh  boy... it ended up big! Our booth was always filled with people, who, I  guess, got attracted by the touchscreens we have. But attracting people  is of no good if you can't get them interested. We did various demos on  the touchscreens, but our small secret ingredient were the workshops:  four times a day (and sometimes even more), people could sit down in our  booth to participate in a session on various topics — those ranged from  learning Inkscape, to creating your first package in the Build Service,  via playing together with GNOME Shell. That really worked out well,  especially at it helps getting the visitors more involved in the  discussion."

#### [h-online/Thorsten Leemhuis: Kernel Log: Linus resolves  to apply a strict policy over merging changes](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Linus-resolves-to-apply-a-strict-policy-over-merging-changes-1026919.html)




     "It would appear that Linus Torvalds has resolved to apply a  strict policy of accepting only bug fix changes to the kernel after the  merge window has closed. Torvalds has also stuck his oar into the debate  over the Android suspend block API and made the situation even more  complicated."

### For Desktop Users





#### [FEWT: Speed up Open Office!](http://www.fewt.com/2010/06/speed-up-open-office.html)




     "Open Office is pretty slow and painful to use out of the box.  This simple step by step procedure speeds up the software, making it  much more pleasant to use." 



### For  Commandline/Script Newbies





#### [The Geek Stuff/Sasikala: Keeping You in the Loop – Bash  For, While, Until Loop Examples](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/06/bash-for-while-until-loop-examples)




     "Looping statements are used to force a program to repeatedly  execute a statement. The executed statement is called the loop body. 
     Loops execute until the value of a controlling expression is  0. The controlling expression may be any scalar data type. 
     The shell language also provide several iteration or looping  statements. In this article let us review the looping statements which  bash provides using some examples." 



### For System Administrators





#### [Coly  Li: Random I/O — Is raw device always faster than file system ?](http://blog.coly.li/?p=87)




     "For some implementations of distributed file systems, like TFS  [1], developers think storing data on raw device directly (e.g.  /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc…) might be faster than on file systems. 
     Their choice is reasonable, 
     1, Random I/O on large file cannot get any help from file  system page cache. 
     2, <logical offset, physical offset> mapping introduces  more I/O on file systems than on raw disk 
     3, Managing metadata on other powerful servers avoid the  necessary to use file systems for data nodes." 



#### [Pascal Bleser: sudo X applications on openSUSE](http://dev-loki.blogspot.com/2010/06/sudo-x-applications-on-opensuse.html)




     "sudo is a very powerful tool when used wisely (i.e. not as  it's done on Ubuntu). 
     By default, sudo is configured in a much more restricted way  on openSUSE than on, say, Ubuntu, to avoid any open security loopholes. 
     If, nevertheless, you would like to use sudo to run X  applications, here is how to do it."

#### [Sebastian Kügler: Surely, I’m going to Akademy, too!](http://vizzzion.org/blog/2010/06/surely-im-going-to-akademy-too/)




     "I’m on the first leg of my trip back to the Netherlands right  now. I’ve spent a couple of days in Bretagne, France to celebrate the  marriage of a close friend, who asked me to be his best man. The  celebrations, which lasted for three days were terrific, but also pretty  tiring as you don’t get to spend much time just by yourself. The main  celebration was held in the "ridiculously beautiful" Chateau Domaine de  la Bretesche, and in Pornichet, the home of the bride. I’m returning to  the Netherlands right now, for three days of desk time (needed to  prepare my Akademy talk and to get some last minute work done on the  impending openSUSE 11.3 release). On Friday, I’ll be boarding a flight  to Helsinki and then on to Tampere to take part in my fifth Akademy." 



#### [Mike McCallister: How Do You Learn About KDE?](http://metaverse.wordpress.com/2010/06/29/how-do-you-learn-about-kde/)




     "A discussion has popped up on the KOffice-Devel list as to  whether to discontinue the user-oriented KOffice mailing list. Some  developers are wondering whether it’s worth it to keep this admittedly  low-traffic list going. The main argument being that if people aren’t  using the list now, the few questions that do get asked may not be  getting the attention they deserve. 
     I have an opinion on the subject, but I’m not sure that’s all  that important. : As a technical communicator, what I’m interested in is  how others learn about and solve problems with their software,  particularly in the open source arena. KOffice doesn’t have the mind  share and user base that other open source productivity suites (OK, I  mean OpenOffice.org) have, but are there channels today’s Linux geek and  her grandma use to get support for their software. There are lots of  choices, and it would be interesting and helpful to me, the KOffice and  KDE teams to learn those preferences." 



#### [Pascal Bleser: Shorter .repo URLs](http://dev-loki.blogspot.com/2010/07/shorter-repo-urls.html)




     "A few days ago, I blogged about using r.opensu.se for shorter  package repository URLs, including passing e.g. [http://r.opensu.se/network:utilities/11.2/r](http://r.opensu.se/network:utilities/11.2/r) to zypper ar -r to add a repository. 
     Turned out it didn't work, because zypper wouldn't follow the  redirect. So I rewrote that part by handing over such URLs to a CGI  script that reverse proxies the .repo file from [http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/) (it fetches the proper .repo URL and passes the result to zypper)." 



#### [Lubos  Lunak: Packager-O-Matic](http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/4265)




     "As already mentioned, I have this certain tool in works that  can do various magic when it comes to creating packages, especially for  people who have no idea how to do them themselves. And since i'm going  to the Acadamy too, and on Wednesday I have scheduled a slot for demoing  the tool and helping people who'd like to create packages of their  software, I've worked on implementing and improving various features  that make it more interesting: ..." 



#### [Rares Aioanei: Weekly Review of PostgreSQL with openSUSE  Flavor](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/07/03/guest-blog-rares-aioanei-weekly-review-of-postgresql-with-opensuse-flavor/)




    "Very interesting Weekly Review from Rares. Thanks :-)" 



#### [Lubos Lunak: Difficult, difficult...](http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/4260)




     "It is interesting to notice what is sometimes seen as  difficult. "It's too hard for me, I can't do that." "I'll never be able  to do that, that's nothing for me." Like if most things could be done  instantly just by snapping one's fingers. They instead require all these  tedious things like effort, trying, learning, practicing and so on. The  funny thing is, figuring out things in the IT area is not really that  demanding. Wanna write a Plasma applet? There's a step-by-step tutorial  at Techbase, just follow it blindly and with a decent skill in reading  and typing, tadda, there's a Plasma applet. Wanna a package in the build  service? You can use another one as a template, find a tutorial on the  wiki or just google for it, and if you'll be just a little lucky, a tool  can even do the work for you."

### Announcements





#### [First Release Candidate for SC 4.5 Ready to Go](http://www.kdenews.org/2010/06/27/first-release-candidate-sc-45-ready-go)




     "In the month since the second beta the KDE community has fixed  hundreds of bugs. Development of features has been frozen for a while  now and the Software Compilation is at the point where it needs a good  testing to shake out the last issues. 
     So if you can spare some time and can help us identify  problems or (in)validate other bug reports we'd be more than happy.  Moreover, if you want to check out what's coming in terms of features  and improvements to our workspaces, applications and development  platform, this RC is a good choice for a test run." 



#### [K3b 2.0 released](http://k3b.plainblack.com/k3b-news/k3b-news/k3b-2.0-released)




     "Today the reformed K3b team within the KDE Community is proud  to release the final 2.0 of the premier disk recording application,  codenamed “Komeback”. Although pre-release versions have already enjoyed  widespread adoption, we'd like to recap some of the highlights of this  release. 
     (...) 
     With a few exceptions, K3b keeps feature-parity with 1.0.x  series, but it also introduces a number of new features. Perhaps the  biggest among these is support for Blu-ray drives. Additionally a lot of  work have been put into improving the overall user experience. Some  work-flows have been merged abstracting it for all kinds of media." 



#### [Miguel de Icaza: TweetStation: Elevating the Discourse](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Jul-10.html)




    "TweetStation is my first native iPhone app (as opposed to my  award-winning HTML5-app iCoaster). More screenshots can be seen here 
     Just like Rails, TweetStation is an opinionated Tweeting  client, it contains my personal blend of features that I enjoy from  other twitter clients, but also tries to do something about changing the  world. 
     TweetStation has been designed to elevate the level of  discourse on Twitter." 



### Reports





#### [Kai Ahrens: Better multimedia support for OpenOffice.org  on Unix systems](http://blogs.sun.com/GullFOSS/entry/better_multimedia_support_for_openoffice1)




     "Playing back audio and video content on Unix system was and is  still a matter of choices. 
     On the one hand, this is a good thing for the user. It offers a  wide range of frameworks that best suit his/her needs. But on the other  hand, this also brings a developer of a multi platform, general purpose  Office productivity suite like OpenOffice.org (OOo) into the situation  to make a choice. The choice needs to be made just to ensure that we  don't have to provide a different backend for all multimedia frameworks  that already exist. This just doesn't work for resource reasons. So, a  framework needs to be chosen that meets the needs of a group of users as  large as possible." 



#### [Phoronix/Michael Larabel: Qualcomm Releases Open-Source  2D/3D Kernel Driver](http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=ODM4OA)




     "If you happen to have Google's Nexus One or other phones based  upon Qualcomm's Snapdragon processor, there is great news today.  Qualcomm has just released an open-source 2D/3D kernel driver for their  OpenGL ES graphics processor. This Qualcomm kernel driver provides  support for interrupts, command streams, context switching, memory  management, etc. Qualcomm is looking to push this code into the mainline  Linux kernel ASAP." 



#### [Nagappan Alagappan: Nautilus automated test script under  Mago applications](http://nagappanal.blogspot.com/2010/07/nautilus-automated-test-script-under.html)




     "As part of an effort to expand Mago a bit by adding nautilus,  Jeff Lane from Ubuntu created a launchpad team called mago-applications.  It was created to let people interested in adding new applications to  Mago collaborate on the same code bases without cluttering up the  mago-contributors team. 
     The way we see it, mago-applications can focus on simply  adding new application interfaces and test suites/cases to Mago, while  mago-contributors can focus on the core Mago code making sure it works  with the latest changes to LDTP and so forth." 



#### [PCWorld/Joab Jackson: Unix Active Directory Software  Faster](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/200381/unix_active_directory_software_faster.html)




     "Likewise Software has released a new version of its  open-source authentication software for allowing Linux, Apple Macintosh  and commercial Unix-based computers to hook into Microsoft Active  Directory controlled servers and networks."

#### [ITworld/Brian Proffitt: Review: SUSE Linux Enterprise  Server 11 SP1](http://www.itworld.com/open-source/110854/review-suse-linux-enterprise-server-11-sp1)




     "Novell announced their first service pack release for SUSE  Enterprise Linux Server (SLES), and if you like virtualization, this is a  very strong platform from which you can get started. 
     That's because, for now, Novell is going to be supporting KVM  and Xen (plus Microsoft's Hyper-V tech) within SLES 11 SP1 -- and that's  not taking into account the recent Novell/VMware partnership that will  have VMware distributing SLES as a commoditized operating system  offering."
