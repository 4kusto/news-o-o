Following up on Michael Loeffler's previous RC1 [announcement](https://news.opensuse.org/2010/06/17/opensuse-approaching-destination-please-fasten-your-seat-belts-opensuse-11-3-rc1-is-available/), openSUSE is now doing a final check of instrumentation before landing.Â  The weather continues to be clear and all conditions continue to be smooth, and all systems are a go for final landing on July 15, 2010.Â  Now's the time for us all to download the latest openSUSE RC2 release and all join in on a final check and get that 11.3 polished and in good condition.Â  You can download RC2 from our [software portal](http://software.opensuse.org/developer/en) and find detailed information on the evolving openSUSE 11.3 [page](http://wiki.opensuse.org/Product_highlights).

You can find our most annoying bugs [here](http://en.opensuse.org/Bugs:Most_Annoying_Bugs_11.3_dev).Â  And if you find anything new, please do report it on Bugzilla.Â  The ground crew needs your reports!

Have a lot of fun and let's get to downloading!Â  They're waiting to greet us at the terminal.
