        [Roger
          Luedecke: Impressions of 12.1](http://opensuseadventures.blogspot.com/2011/11/impressions-of-121.html)
      

First, I must reiterate that this blog in no way is intended to be explicitly technical
        or even well organized. Rather, it is meant to be more conversational. So in this posting
        I'll be stating my impressions now of the recently released 12.1 and some notes to new
        users. 

Honestly I have very mixed feelings about this release. But when you consider the
        complexity of all the things a Linux distribution entails, with all of its technologies and
        software this should ultimately be no surprise. Likewise with bugs; considering the
        complexity there will of course be bugs. 12.1 offers a lot of new technologies, very little
        of which I actually care about or find personally useful. Bugs... it seems like this release
        is especially buggy. However I don't think that is actually the case, but rather that some
        of the bugs that have cropped up are just a bit more "in your face" than some other bugs
        that have cropped up. Some of these I ran into myself, but I certainly can't ignore the many
        many improvements to the core technologies and software. (...)

[Han Wen Kam: My openSUSE 12 Journal - 4: Minor Frustrations](http://sellingfreesoftwareforaliving.blogspot.com/2011/12/my-opensuse-12-journal-4-minor.html)

This is my fourth journal entry for openSUSE 12.1 and it has been two weeks of
        operational use on both my Thinkpad and home PC. Here are some additional minor frustrations
        and some workarounds... and yes, I have posted on the openSUSE forums (just in case you'd
        ask). 

**Boot 12.1 using the old System V init**
      

In my first journal entry, I complained the lack of "chattiness" during boot since the
        adoption of Systemd. You can easily switch to the old System V init on boot. At the grub
        boot loader screen (usual 8 seconds delay) and **before** you hit Enter to boot, press the **F5** button to switch from default to
          System V. Now, press **Enter** to boot and press
        the **Esc** key during the splash screen to see the familiar
        System V init messages.

        [Desktop Linux Reviews/Jim Lynch: openSUSE 12.1 KDE](http://desktoplinuxreviews.com/2011/11/26/opensuse-12-1-kde/)
      

openSUSE is one of the most popular desktop distros available. This time around it™s version 12.1 that has been released. If you aren™t familiar with openSUSE then you should know that it comes in KDE, GNOME, Xfce and LXDE versions. For this review I™ve picked the KDE version of openSUSE 12.1. I may do a quick look at the GNOME version on [Eye On Linux](http://eyeonlinux.com/) later though.

Speaking of the GNOME version of openSUSE 12.1, I took a quick peek at it to see if the openSUSE had made any significant changes to the dreadful GNOME 3 desktop. Unfortunately, they didn™t though they should have. The Linux Mint developers did a good job on altering the GNOME 3.2 desktop to make it usable; I had hoped the openSUSE developers would do the same. Alas, perhaps they will in the next release. The lack of GNOME 3 tweaks is one of the reasons why I decided to review the KDE version instead.

Okay, enough babble about GNOME. Let™s get on with this review of openSUSE 12.1 KDE. (...)

        [Das U-Blog/Prashanth: Review: openSUSE 12.1 GNOME + KDE](http://dasublogbyprashanth.blogspot.com/2011/11/review-opensuse-121-gnome-kde.html)
      

It's November again, so what does that mean? It means there's another new release of openSUSE, and I'm reviewing it.

openSUSE doesn't really need much of an introduction here. There are a few new things with this release, though. The first is that GNOME 3 has become an official part of openSUSE; this is not surprising considering that openSUSE and Fedora were the only distributions who provided vanilla live CD previews of GNOME 3 before its official release. The second is that the release numbering and schedule have changed. Now, there will be releases in November, July, and March, and they will respectively have decimal numbers ".1", ".2", and ".3" before the number before the decimal point gets incremented by one with the next November release. This means that there will be no more ".0" or ".4" releases, and that the jump from, for example, version 13.1 to 13.2 will be just as significant as the jump from version 12.3 to 13.1. (...)

        [My Linux Rig: A Review of GNOME 3 and OpenSUSE 12.1](http://www.mylinuxrig.com/post/13403783266/a-review-of-gnome-3-and-opensuse-12-1)
      

I was curious to try out OpenSUSE 12.1 not just because the buzz on it is that it™s a great release, but also because it presented a chance to kick the tires on GNOME 3, which I still hadn™t worked with.

I tested it on my ThinkPad T43 (on the actual machine and not in a virtual one) and it installed with no problems. Everything worked perfectly out of the box (as a side note, [on a recent edition of the Tux Radar podcast](http://www.tuxradar.com/content/podcast-season-3-episode-22), host Jonathan Roberts credited improvements in the Linux kernel in making non-Ubuntu distributions competitive hardware-wise; where Ubuntu found early success getting hardware to work, now the kernel itself seems to handle a lot of that heavy lifting for distributions).

OpenSUSE with GNOME 3 looked great. Everything worked. Everything felt fast, even on an older machine with 2GB RAM. (...)

        [Muktware/Swapnil Bhartiya: OpenSUSE KDE 12.1 Review: I Take My Words Back](http://www.muktware.com/articles/3036)
      

openSUSE 12.1 is the best openSUSE ever as far as I can tell -- whether it be Gnome 3 or KDE. Interestingly, openSUSE is the major contributor to the Gnome project, yet its KDE implementation is considered to be the finest integrations.

Being an Ubuntu user (and apt-get fan), I never flirted with openSUSE much. I did try it every time a new version comes out, but from a home user's point of view it was more work than Ubuntu and the pay off wasn't that much so I stayed away from it.  But everything has changed with version 12.1. It is much more stable (compared to Ubuntu 11.10) and useful for me.

I love Gnome 3 (thanks to the shell-extensions), yet I needed something for those who are not comfortable with Gnome 3 Shell and want a windows like environment.  KDE always fascinated me and I thought of giving KDE a try on openSUSE.

[openSUSE Board election 2011 started](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/12/02/opensuse-board-election-2011-started/)

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/elections2011.jpeg)

The openSUSE board election just started! Please go to:

[https://connect.opensuse.org/pg/polls/read/digitaltomm/15228/opensuse-board-election-2011](https://connect.opensuse.org/pg/polls/read/digitaltomm/15228/opensuse-board-election-2011)
      and cast your vote for this election. All [openSUSE
        members](http://en.opensuse.org/Members) are eligible to vote.

The board consists of 6 members and one chairperson. As the election period of Bryen
      Yunashko, Pavol Rusnak and Rupert Horstkotter ends, this election will appoint 3 new board
      members.

The election period ends at December the 16th.

All candidates have put their agenda on the [wiki](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election_2011), linked as Platform
      after the candidates™ name.

If you have any questions, please contact the election officials
      (`<[election-officials@opensuse.org](mailto:election-officials@opensuse.org)>`).

[Pascal Bleser: openSUSE election platform 2011](http://dev-loki.blogspot.com/2011/12/opensuse-election-platform-2011.html)

Yep, I'm running for the privilege of being on the openSUSE board again. Lots of fine
      candidates this time, which is pretty cool in its own right.

I finally managed to fill out the remaining bits of [my
        election platform page](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election_2011_platform_template_yaloki), so if you're interested, please have a read -- yes, I know,
      it's long ;)

The short summary:

  * I care about the contributors, their environment, it must be a fun place where
            people feel comfortable, with friends

  * I care a lot about the people aspects of the project, probably even more so than for
            the technical bits

  * I believe that I have a few ideas on concrete things we (and specifically, but not
            only, the board) should get involved in

All that "I, I, I" comes quite tedious, to be honest, and I'm under the impression that
      I'm bragging around, which is something my inner beast is spanking me for, endlessly. But
      well, the whole purpose is specifically to explain what each candidate proposes so I guess
      it's fine.

So if you adhere to [what I
        wrote there](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election_2011_platform_template_yaloki) and/or if you trust me to do the right things, do vote for me -- don't
      think that oh well, I'll be elected anyway, if everybody thinks like that, I won't ;D





[Richard Brown: Running for the openSUSE
        board](http://www.sysrich.co.uk/?p=3)

openSUSE, the FOSS project near and dear to my heart is electing 3 new members to sit on
      its [Board](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board), the group that has the
      responsibility to help guide the great ship Geeko forward.

I™m standing alongside a number of great candidates in the hope of being one of the 3
      elected this year.

My full platform can be read on [my
        election page here](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election_2011_platform_template_rbrownccb)

I™m excited at the idea of trying something new, taking on a new challenge, and having an
      opportunity to get my hands dirty helping out the best (and greenest) FOSS project out
      there.

If you™re an [openSUSE Member](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Members)
      please consider me for one of your 3 votes, which you can place on our [openSUSE Connect Election Poll](https://connect.opensuse.org//pg/polls/read/digitaltomm/15228/opensuse-board-election-2011)

Thanks to everyone who™s supporting me and wish me luck for the results when the poll
      closes in two weeks.

        [SUSE Studio/David Majda: Upgrade your appliances to openSUSE 12.1 ](http://blog.susestudio.com/2011/11/upgrade-your-appliances-to-opensuse-121.html)
      

Last week we enabled one-click upgrade of old openSUSE appliances to[just
          released](http://blog.susestudio.com/2011/11/opensuse-121-in-suse-studio.html) openSUSE 12.1. The upgrade works the same way [as with
          previous versions](http://blog.susestudio.com/2011/03/upgrade-your-older-appliances-to.html). Just open your old 11.4 (or even 11.3 or 11.2) appliance, go to
        the Start tab and click on the **Upgrade** button in the bar at
        the top. 

![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8NJlWgTSjtk/TtOVW0bFSxI/AAAAAAAACd4/jvWckP4nQs0/s320/upgrade1.png)

How does the upgrade magic work? Generally Studio tries to change repositories to their
        12.1 equivalents and sometimes adds or removes few packages to ensure everything works
        smoothly. You can see what exactly was done in the log accessible from the bar at the bottom
        of the Start tab.

![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8f-J3LNCZes/TtOVaokAYGI/AAAAAAAACeA/kqJutCl6uq4/s320/upgrade2.png)

Sometimes the upgraded appliance will need few tweaks to work. Just inspect the log, see
        what was changed, and apply any additional adjustments. Let us know what you had to do on
        our [forum](http://susestudio.com/forum/) or `<[studio-users@suse.de](mailto:studio-users@suse.de)>` mailing list so we can improve the upgrade
        in the future.

If you are not satisfied with the upgrade, you can always revert to original version by
        clicking the **Undo upgrade** link.

[SUSE Studio/Robert
          Schweikert: Managed Clouds with RightScale](http://blog.susestudio.com/2011/11/managed-clouds.html)

Having your head in the clouds and managing virtual machines (VMs) which run there is
        one thing, really getting there is another. An often neglected step in cloud discussions is
        the cloud on-ramp, or How does the VM providing the needed
          functionality get there in the first place? Also frequently ignored is the
        question of What's inside the VM? Maybe these questions
        are "ignored" as they are inconvenient and not necessarily easy to answer. Similar to
        driving a car on the highway - once on the highway going along with the flow of traffic is
        easy, but navigating the on-ramp poses a set of challenges that make many uncomfortable. 

The on-ramp to the cloud can take various shapes. One is to pre-build task specific VMs
        (eg. a web server), which is easy with [SUSE
          Studio](http://susestudio.com/) and [KIWI](http://opensuse.github.com/kiwi/). If you have
        multiple functions that needs to be distributed between multiple instances, you can build
        one image each and then launch them in the cloud. (...)

Ray's comment starting with "Every flicker and mode change in the boot
            process takes away from the whole experience." is especially interesting. Is it
            okay to track the "don't show grub by default" here?

An easy way to remove Software! For example: you installed an application with "1-click install" (which will install all the packages that you need), there should be an easy way (also with 1 click) to remove what you have installed with that 1-click operation... in another words: an "1-click Uninstall" to remove installed software (dependencies and packages included).

Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn't
            going to go away. The code itself isn't well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It's only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don't have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

            [Do not enable Kwin blur effect by default](https://features.opensuse.org/313026)
          

By default, if Kwin compositing is enabled / supported on openSUSE KDE (even 12.1), the
blur effect is enabled by default. This is a notorious option for KDE's desktop effects that is usually the culprit for why the user's effects run choppy or sluggish, especially if they do not have fairly modern hardware. It happens on any distro.

**This effect should not be enabled by default. Aesthetically, it does not bring much to the table; however, performance wise, it can create a poor first impression.**

When browsing different forums, it is one the first questions asked when a user complains about poor Kwin performance: "Do you have blur enabled?"






            [Yast partitioner should detect encrypted partitions and prompt for password](https://features.opensuse.org/313027)
          

Currently if starting the YAST partitioner on a system where the encrypted partitions were not unlocked at boot there is no way in the partition to unlock them (ie. entering the password).

This can be easily seen by booting the Opensuse 12.1 KDE LiveCD image on a machine that has an encrypted partition. You need to manually unlock the partition using either Dolphin or the command line. YAST partitioner detects the encrypted partition but provides no way to unlock it.






            [Yast partitioner should show de-activated VGs/LVs and allow them to be activated](https://features.opensuse.org/313028)
          

Sometimes LVs (LVM Logical Volumes) won't come up in status 'Active'. This happens often for example if you boot the Opensuse 12.1 LiveCD on a machine which uses LVM partitioning. You have to manually follow this procedure to get the VGs and LVs to show up:

pvscan # find all Physical Volumes

vgscan # find all Volume Groups

lvscan # find all Logical Volumes

lvchange -ay /dev/TestingVG/home # activate a Logical Volume that's not activated by default


The YAST partitioner should automatically find all Physical Volumes and Volume Groups and show the deactivated Logical Volumes, with an option of course to activate these. The YAST Partitioner is the most logical place for this functionality in a GUI program.






            [Update option in Apper Software Management](https://features.opensuse.org/313029)
          

Hiï¼Œ I think with these features Apper will be better.

1. Update option

Nowadays Apper only ship with install and remove option. it's hardwork if you update.

2. Aggregation of packages

if you search an application, it gives you tens of packages with the same name, if you enabled many different repo. even within the same repo, it will give you different versions. it is confusing.

3. Stick Applications you installed to the roof and Applications you installed and updatable to the roof of roof by default. in YaST, you can do it by click Name tab, but Apper ships with no such method.






            [AppSet instead of Apper](https://features.opensuse.org/313030)
          

AppSet [http://appset.altervista.org/joomla/en](http://appset.altervista.org/joomla/en) can be the default package manager on openSUSE cause, is written in QT and other distribution such Archlinux and Chakra Linux (know for his addiction with KDE desktop). (...)






            [Invent Consistent Font Naming Schema](https://features.opensuse.org/313035)
          

Currently, our package names for fonts are suboptimal. Here are some examples:

farsifonts

fonts-arabic

freefont

gnu-unifont

indic-fonts

intlfonts-ttf

xorg-x11-fonts

From a usability perspective, it would be better to make a consistent naming schema for font packages. Naming schemas from other distributions:

* Ubuntu: prefix with "ttf-"

*   Fedora: suffix with "-fonts"

With the above inconcistency, popular fonts like LinuxLibertine or dejavu cannot be found.

Please document any decisions in the Package Guidelines regarding how to name our fonts correctly and consistently.

Several of you has all kind of non feature (mostly called bugs) with Gnome3.2 and kde4
            etc¦

I will just copy/google translate/paste here the comment made by Sebastian Siebert on
            his blog

Okay, now that was a long night for me was. ï·½ I™ve researched intensively since
            yesterday evening after the problem of GNOME 3.2 and the XvBA hardware acceleration on
            openSUSE 12.1. Here, a blog reader has pointed out that the direct installation of the
            AMD Catalyst could solve the problem. However, I think the direct installation of
            anything since like AMD will move the existing files, and thus endangering the integrity
            of files. But I had to start somewhere and so did the RPM package and direct install AMD
            compared. I could detect no difference in principle, except that some files were
            installed in a different directory, where they had really nothing to be related. I could
            at first make any sense why the RPM installation failed. To me a very banal story is
            remembered. A specific search path ld.so.conf could possibly be kicked out in openSUSE
            12.1. I have my current openSUSE 11.4 /etc/ld.so.conf compared with that of openSUSE
            12.1 and lo and behold some search paths were removed. I have the necessary path to
            /usr/X11R6/lib/ or created and /usr/X11R6/lib64 in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/fglrx.conf for the
            fglrx driver, and lo and behold vainfo tells me that everything is in order. Now comes
            the interesting question: Is the problem fixed with GNOME 3.2 now? The answer: YES! ï·½
            So, dear people, you invite the makerpm-ati-down script with the updated packaging
            script installs the driver as usual and have fun with the new openSUSE 12.1 and the AMD
            Catalyst driver. (...)

**A number of changes to Btrfs mean that filesystem structures will not be as prone to corruption in case of system crashes. By bundling blocks into clusters, Ext4 should be a lot faster in some scenarios. CIFS also promises speed gains.**

Last week, just in time for the US Thanksgiving holiday, Linus Torvalds [released](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1220028) the third pre-release version of Linux 3.2. The commits since RC2 have, according to Torvalds, been mostly small and reasonable, though there is "certainly more churn" than he would have liked.

Torvalds is likely to release the fourth pre-release version at the end of this week or the start of next, with the final release expected in early to mid-January. In light of the ongoing development of Linux 3.2, the Kernel Log is continuing its "Coming in 3.2" series by describing new features in the area of filesystems. The first article in the series looked at changes to [network drivers and network infrastructure](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-3-2-Part-1-Networking-1379085.html); articles on architecture code, infrastructure and drivers for other hardware will follow over the next few weeks.

I had to struggled a bit to connect my HP Photosmart Prem c410 printer on openSUSE. Coming from Ubuntu, I was used to 'add printer' button and just follow the click-next procedure.

Under openSUSE it's a bit different. openSUSE 12.1 comes with HPLIP Tool which makes it easier to install and configure HP printers. If your printer is connected through the wireless (as was mine), you can set it up using this tool.

HPLIP wants the user to be added to several groups (I learned that after 3 failed attempts, so I am saving your time). Before firing the HP Tool, go to YaST and click on 'User and Group Management Accounts'. (...)

While the live version showed the network icon in the tray, once I installed it on my desktop it was gone. There was no Internet.  I noticed this behavior only on the desktop, everything was fine on my laptop.

The reason being KDE defaults to YaST's Network setting if it detects that you are running a desktop. (...)

        OSX and Windows.Ã½ The client is also free-of-charge for iOS devices but "crippled".Ã½ If you
        like the solution, you pay for the client.

Laurent Godard, Markus Mohrhard, and myself have been working pretty hard in the past
      month to bring the performance of ODS import filter to a reasonable level, especially with
      documents containing a large number of named ranges.Here is the background. Laurent uses
      LibreOffice as a platform for his professional extension, which makes heavy use of named
      ranges. It programmatically generates ODS documents and inserts hundred™s or thousand™s of
      named ranges as intermediary storage to further process the data. The problem was, however,
      our import performance with that kind of documents was so suboptimal that this process was
      taking a prohibitively long time. In order for his extension to perform optimally, our ODS
      import filter needed to be optimized, and optimized heavily. (...)

[h-online: Balsam Enterprise OBS offers a commercial build platform](http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Balsam-Enterprise-OBS-offers-a-commercial-build-platform-1388329.html)

German company [open-slx](http://enterprise.open-slx.com/en/?Welcome)
        has announced the release of the [Balsam Enterprise Open Build System (BE-OBS)](http://enterprise.open-slx.com/en/?BE-OBS), a distribution development platform
        for Linux software. The system is a commercialised version of openSUSE's [Open Build Service](http://openbuildservice.org/) which automates the build
        and release process for Linux software. openSUSE's OBS is used by SUSE and openSUSE, by
        other companies such as Dell, Cray and GENIVI, and projects including MeeGo. BE-OBS is used
        internally by open-slx to construct their own Linux products, which has also enabled the
        company to develop its own in-house expertise. 

The BE-OBS uses a cluster of systems with load-balanced build agents to enable building
        and packaging, testing and release, and distribution and maintenance. It is suitable for
        building custom Linux distributions, dedicated software stacks, cross-platform applications
        and virtual appliances. BE-OBS is able to automate compilation from a single codebase
        targeting different hardware architectures, including 32- and 64-bit x86 and ARM, and using
        different operating systems including SLES, RHEL and CentOS. (...)

        [ITworld/Brian Proffitt: Why free software is not a job killer](http://www.itworld.com/it-managementstrategy/228371/why-free-software-not-job-killer)
      

Catching up on the post-Holiday news, I read with interest this headline on today's ComputerWorld UK site:

"[Does Free Software cost jobs?](http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/spannermans-edublog/2011/11/does-free-software-cost-jobs/index.htm)"

The author of the article is Dr. John Spencer, who laments that during the current recession, the message of free and open source software's (FLOSS) cost benefits have indeed been taken to heart¦ so much so that there are hardly any open IT jobs in the British education sector. (...)

Perhaps you aren't a pet person. Some of my best friends aren't, either. Or maybe you are Apple-obsessed or a Windows enthusiast. I love my Mac and know plenty of people who work with Windows. In any case, here are a few ways living with my pets reminds me of living with Linux. (...)

        [eSecurityPlanet/Sean Michael Kerner: Apache Server Hit by Reverse Proxy](http://www.esecurityplanet.com/network-security/apache-server-hit-by-reverse-proxy.html)
      

The open source Apache HTTP Web Server is at risk from a reverse proxy flaw that is currently unpatched. The flaw was disclosed Qualys security researcher Purtha Parikh late last week and is related to a flaw that Apache first attempted to fix in October.

"While reviewing the patch for the older issue CVE-2011-3368, it appeared that it was still possible to make use of a crafted request that could exploit a fully patched Apache Web Server (Apache 2.2.21 with CVE-2011-3368 patch applied) to allow access to internal systems if the reverse proxy rules are configured incorrectly, Parikh [reported](https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2011/11/23/apache-reverse-proxy-bypass-issue).
