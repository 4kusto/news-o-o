See the openSUSE Project at [the Utah Open Source Conference this week](//2008.utosc.com/pages/home/)!

The Utah Open Source Conference is going on August 28 through August 30 at the Salt Lake Community College. The openSUSE Project will be hosting a table to show off the latest and greatest in openSUSE, and Novell and openSUSE also will have several speakers/talks on the agenda including:



	
  * Aaron Bockover: [Banshee Media Player](//2008.utosc.com/presentation/117/)

	
  * Brian Merrel, Sanford Armstrong: [Linux accessibility efforts at Novell](//2008.utosc.com/presentation/124/)

  * Andrew Jorgensen: [openSUSE Build Service](//2008.utosc.com/presentation/18/)


As part of Hack Week, [we'll also have a room set aside for Hack Week III participants](//blog.utos.org/2008/08/19/novell-hack-week-coming-to-utosc-2008/), so you can watch the hacking in real time.

The schedule runs from 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. local time Thursday and Friday, and from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. on Saturday. See the full schedule on the UTOSC Web site: [//2008.utosc.com/speaker/schedule/](//2008.utosc.com/speaker/schedule/), and the events and activities here: [//2008.utosc.com/pages/events/](//2008.utosc.com/pages/events/).

We're also looking for more volunteers for the openSUSE booth at the show. Please contact [Zonker](mailto:zonker@opensuse.org) if you're interested.
