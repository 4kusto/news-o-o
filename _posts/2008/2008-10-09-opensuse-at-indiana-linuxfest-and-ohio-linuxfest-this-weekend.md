The openSUSE Project is going to have a presence at the Indiana Linuxfest and Ohio Linuxfests this weekend.

Friday, the [Indiana Linuxfest is taking place in Bloomington, Indiana](//racinfo.indiana.edu/linuxfest/) at Indiana University in the Indiana Memorial Union from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. openSUSE Community Manager Joe 'Zonker' Brockmeier will be giving the opening keynote, "Building Community and Taking Linux to the Masses," at 10 a.m.

The Indiana Linuxfest has a [diverse schedule](//racinfo.indiana.edu/linuxfest/schedule.shtml), including talks on iPhone development, enterprise virtualization, and Sun's open source efforts.

The Ohio LinuxFest 2008 takes place Friday and Saturday. Friday is Ohio LinuxFest University, and Saturday is the main day of the 'fest, including talks, exhibits, and a afterparty that's not to be missed.

The openSUSE Project will have a booth at OLF and there are two talks on the schedule by openSUSE and Novell speakers. Joe 'Zonker' Brockmeier will be giving the 8 a.m. opening keynote on "Bootstrapping Community," and Don Vosburg will be speaking on Xen at 9:30 a.m.

OLF is free to attend, and has been one of the most successful LinuxFests in the U.S. for several years running. It's not too late to register, or just show up early Saturday morning.

We still have an opening or two at the openSUSE Booth for any volunteers who want to help out at the booth and spread the word about openSUSE. If you're interested, just drop a note to [Zonker](mailto:zonker@opensuse.org).

Look forward to seeing you there!
