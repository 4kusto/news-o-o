![ENOS](//www.cgoncalves.info/images/opensuse/enos/enos_200.png)



The acronym ENOS stands for '_Encontro Nacional de openSUSE_', a Portuguese expression which can be translated to '_National openSUSE Meeting_', an event meant to unite the Portuguese openSUSE users, as well as provide the participants an inside view into the latest developments in the openSUSE project and stimulate them to take an active part in the community itself.

[ENOS 2008](//pt.opensuse.org/Eventos/ENOS) is the second yearly edition ([read about ENOS 2007 here](//en.opensuse.org/Events/ENOS/2007)) of the event and will be held in Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto, Porto, Portugal on **Saturday, 6 September.**
