In order to provide a better service to the existing openSUSE Community and to our new users, we're pleased to announce that [suseforums.net](//www.suseforums.net), [suselinuxsupport.de](//www.suselinuxsupport.de) and the openSUSE support forums at [forums.novell.com](//forums.novell.com/opensuse-support-forums/) (the three largest English speaking dedicated SUSE forums) are joining forces to merge into the new official openSUSE Forums at forums.opensuse.org.

Behind the scenes, a project team consisting of Novell employees, openSUSE Community members, and existing forums' staff have been working on this project since the beginning of 2008. The new infrastructure will be hosted by Novell to ensure the highest possible quality of service. 
Current plans are to migrate the existing active members of suseforums.net and suselinuxsupport.de into the official openSUSE Forums, simultaneously implementing Single Sign On for the whole openSUSE Community. We hope to make the transition as seamless as possible, and will go live Spring 2008. More information will be posted as available.

All in all, a big gain for the whole openSUSE Community!
