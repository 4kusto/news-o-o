I'd like to give a warm welcome to Joe 'Zonker' Brockmeier who joins the openSUSE project as "openSUSE community manager".  You can reach him directly at zonker@opensuse.org. He has his own openSUSE blog at [//zonker.opensuse.org](//zonker.opensuse.org), I advise to go over and see what he has to say himself!

He is a long time Linux user and does a lot of writing about Linux and open source for several publications and conributed to books as well. Prior to his new role as community manager for openSUSE he served Linux Magazine as Editor-in-Chief. His personal webpage is [//www.dissociatedpress.net](//www.dissociatedpress.net).

The openSUSE community manager will act as community advocate and ombudsman thus relaying openSUSE community and users needs back to Novell. Therefore you will find Zonker on many community events.  He will also drive marketing programs around openSUSE to make the project more successful and attract more developers and users.

Zonker will be travelling the next weeks and you can meet him and other openSUSE members at these two venues:



	
  * at [SCALE](//www.socallinuxexpo.org/)  from 8th to 10th February

	
  * at [FOSDEM](//www.fosdem.org/2008/)  from 23th to 24th February


For those that wonder what happened with the "openSUSE Chief evangelist" position that was opened in October: this is exactly the position, we just found it more suitable to change the title of Joe.

I have talked a lot with Zonker through the last weeks and look forward to working with him - and look forward meeting him soon in person here in NÃ¼rnberg!

Andreas
