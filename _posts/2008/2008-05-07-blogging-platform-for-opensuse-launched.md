Today we are officially launching a new website: [lizards.opensuse.org](//lizards.opensuse.org)!

This site offers blog hosting for [openSUSE members](//en.opensuse.org/Members). The blogs should be focused on the openSUSE project, e.g. on the distribution, packages, build service, events, etc. Please contact the [site administrators](mailto:news-submit@opensuse.org) if you want to have your blog created.

The new site is an additional offering and should not replace any existing blogging platforms. We recognize that many people in the openSUSE community blog on various blogging platforms and encourage everybody to get their blog aggregated on [Planet SUSE](//www.planetsuse.org/) where [lizards.opensuse.org](//lizards.opensuse.org) will be aggregated as well.
