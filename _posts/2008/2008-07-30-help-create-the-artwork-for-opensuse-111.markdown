Now with openSUSE 11.0 out the door, and Alpha 1 of openSUSE 11.1 just released, it's time to start thinking about the look of openSUSE 11.1! Once again this year the Pixel Pool is open for community members to submit ideas about the 11.1 artwork! To make a new theme idea, all you need is a wiki account, and a good idea. Everything from mockups to scanned-in sketches, to even plain text (of course, it has to convey your idea well) can be submitted.

Help make the artwork for openSUSE 11.1 awesome, visit the [Pixel Pool](//en.opensuse.org/Artwork/Pixel_Pool ) today and discuss on the opensuse-artwork mailing list!

Thanks,

Kevin "Yo" Dupuy (AJ is just publishing this on behalf of Kevin)
