In this final [Sneak Peeks](//news.opensuse.org/category/sneak-peeks/) article we will be taking a look at some of the other improvements making their way into openSUSE 11.0. 

<!-- more -->

### Firefox 3.0


openSUSE features the new and latest Firefox 3.0, with the final version distributed through online update. This new version features [several improvements](//www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.0rc3/releasenotes/#whatsnew) to the interface, from user name and password management to changes in the download window.

### OpenOffice.org 2.4



The [OpenOffice.org team](//en.opensuse.org/OpenOffice/Team) has been working hard over the last few months to produce the latest 2.4 release. It features a broad range of changes, most famously the new [OpenGL Impress effects](//www.oooninja.com/2008/02/eye-candy-3d-opengl-transitions-impress.html), giving you a lot of visual eye-candy with animations during each slide change:

### Banshee 1.0


[Aaron Bockover](//en.opensuse.org/User:Aaronbockover) and the Banshee team recently announced the availability of the very substantial [1.0 release](//news.opensuse.org/2008/06/10/banshee-10-released/). It features a broad range of [exciting new changes](//banshee-project.org/download/archives/1.0.0/), including video support, speed improvements, a redesigned interface and better integration with Last.fm.

### KIWI LTSP


The [LTSP5](//opensuse.org/LTSP) implementation on openSUSE continues to dramatically improve, with the initial setup taking less than a minute on openSUSE 11.0, even for non-administrators. The final images will be available in the [openSUSE Edu](//en.opensuse.org/Education) build service repository and the upcoming add-on Edu DVD.



### Kepas - Easy File Sharing


With the previous release we saw the addition of [Giver](//news.opensuse.org/2007/10/02/sneak-peeks-at-opensuse-103-a-plethora-of-improvements/) - an easy GTK+ file-sharing tool, enabling you to quickly send files to others on the same network as you. With openSUSE 11.0 there is now also a KDE application, [Kepas](//www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php/Kepas+-+KDE+Easy+Publish+and+Share?content=73968), to perform the same task, with several additional features.



### Command-Not-Found



Another nice thing to make its way into the [openSUSE Build Service](//opensuse.org/Build_Service) is Command-not-found (for 11.0: [1-click-install](//francis.giannaros.org/command-not-found.ymp)), which is very handy for general usage in the shell. 

Demonstration of what it does:
`20:52 geeko:~> dragon

The program 'dragon' can be found in the following package(s):
* dragonplayer (/usr/bin/dragon)

Try: sudo zypper install dragonplayer

bash: dragon: command not found
20:52 geeko:~> amarokk

Did you mean: 'amarok' ?

bash: amarokk: command not found
20:52 geeko:~> ifconfig

Program 'ifconfig' is present in package 'net-tools', which is installed on your system.

Full path leading to 'ifconfig' is '/sbin/ifconfig'.

Please check your $PATH or maybe program 'ifconfig' is intended to be run only by root.

bash: ifconfig: command not found`

After you've installed it, see the _/usr/share/doc/packages/command-not-found/README_ file for how to enable it by default.
