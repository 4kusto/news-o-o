Survey time again! After nearly a month of the openSUSE 11.0 release we want to know what you think about it, how you use it and about openSUSE.org in general. As usual we will post the results shortly after the survey is closed end of August. We'll raffle some openSUSE t-shirts and caps under all participants. You will find the survey here: [openSUSE 11.0 survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=E93z30BzP6FRP2V_2bpx73qA_3d_3d), it will only takes a few minutes ...

btw: I already got feedback on it. If you think the questions should be different, just send me a mail: mlasars at suse.de ....
