It is nearly done... As announced on our [roadmap](//en.opensuse.org/Education/Development/Edu-CD/Roadmap), I'm happy to announce the first release candidate for our openSUSE-Education add on for openSUSE 11.0!

We've produced an Add-On-ISO image and updated the online repository with the new packages. Everyone who likes to help us testing is very welcome - let's make it the best openSUSE-Education you've ever known :-)


You can find the ISO image here:




**[//www.opensuse-education.org/download/ISOs/openSUSE-Education-1.0-for-11.0-RC1.iso](//www.opensuse-education.org/download/ISOs/openSUSE-Education-1.0-for-11.0-RC1.iso)**




and the online repository here:




**[//www.opensuse-education.org/download/repo/1.0/11.0/](//www.opensuse-education.org/download/repo/1.0/11.0/)**


Now it's time for the [Education Team](//en.opensuse.org/Education/Team) to focus on the documentation and fix the last package bugs. No more updates or additional packages are allowed until we released the final version for 11.0. Please report Bugs in our [Bugzilla](//bugs.opensuse-education.org/) or try another way to [communicate with us](//en.opensuse.org/Education/Communicating).

Known bugs:



	
  * Koha: missing dependencies. Still not fixed :-(

	
  * netbeans-ruby: wrong dependency

	
  * gnome pattern selection: still no provider which KDE applications doesn't work under GNOME.

	
  * Atomix: Main window does not repaint during play


As some people in IRC and on the mailinglist already discussed the package selection, please report packages you want to have installed _always_ or just _shown up_, so we can adapt our selection.

FYI: The final release of openSUSE-Education is planed for 25/09/2008, the next openSUSE-Education meeting is on [Tuesday 2008/09/16 17:00 UTC](//en.opensuse.org/Education/Meetings/Education_Meeting_2008-09-16). Advertisements  are nonexistent in the game, and bugs were nowhere to be found during our time with the game
