Here are the first results of the great [last Meeting](//en.opensuse.org/Education/Meetings/Education_Meeting_2008-11-18) of the openSUSE-Education Team two weeks ago...

We are proud to announce the first openSUSE Live-CD containing applications from openSUSE-Education - created via [Studio](//susestudio.com/) by [Andrea Florio](//lizards.opensuse.org/author/anubisg1/)!

[//www.opensuse-education.org/download/ISOs/openSUSE-Education_1.0.i686-0.0.5-LiveCD.iso](//www.opensuse-education.org/download/ISOs/openSUSE-Education_1.0.i686-0.0.5-LiveCD.iso) (696M)

This ISO image is based on openSUSE 11.0 (x86) and enhanced with a few of our applications for Education. We are currently testing the possibilities of SUSE Studio with the Live-Media - and might release updated versions in a shorter timeframe. Stay tuned!

 ...and a big "THANK YOU" also to our new artist Aishwarya Raja designing a first draft for our new CD Cover:

 

![CD-Cover of openSUSE-Education](//files.opensuse.org/opensuse/en/1/1f/Edu-suse_cd.png)

...and there's a very interesting [thread](//lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-edu/2008-12/msg00003.html) in our mailinglist - here's just a short cutout:


<blockquote>"k, green part of the cover is lizard. 

I tried to guess what is the green one and may be it's only for me, but
it seems that yellow part of the cover represents woman's body covered
with book and Edu logo. So, 'Education have never been so attractive
like now with openSUSE Edu'"</blockquote>


 This time, the [openSUSE-Education Team](//en.opensuse.org/Education/Team) wants to follow the release of openSUSE 11.1 as closely as possible. Luckily, our hard work in the last months pays off now: we're happy to announce Beta2 of or Add-on for the upcoming openSUSE 11.1 right now!

Our updated [Roadmap](//en.opensuse.org/Education/Edu-CD/Roadmap#Beta2.2C_2008-11-30) says it: the next release will be RC1 in two weeks, followed by the "Goldmaster" before Christmas. So this is the last time to add new applications and test and fix the current ones. Please have a look at our new designed [wiki page with desktop applications](//en.opensuse.org/Education/Applications/Desktop) (a big thanks to Kirill ([kkirill](//en.opensuse.org/User:Kkirill)) for this!) to get an overview about the currently available packages.

 

Just use the YaST2 “Add-On Product” module to add our [Online-Repository](//www.opensuse-education.org/download/repo/1.0/11.1/). A more detailed description can be found at the [openSUSE wiki](//en.opensuse.org/Education/Repositories).

For those without permanent Internet connection, we’ve created a DVD ISO which can be downloaded here:

[//www.opensuse-education.org/download/ISOs/openSUSE-Education-1.0-for-11.1-Beta2.iso](//www.opensuse-education.org/download/ISOs/openSUSE-Education-1.0-for-11.1-Beta2.iso)

But be warned: the ISO has 4.9 GB - so you need a DVD9 to burn it. A [delta-iso](//www.opensuse-education.org/download/ISOs/openSUSE-Education-1.0-for-11.1-Beta1_Beta2.delta.iso) against Beta1 is also available.

Known [bugs](//devzilla.novell.com/education/buglist.cgi?query_format=specific&order=relevance+desc&bug_status=__all__&product=openSUSE-Education+1.0+for+11.1&content=):



	
  * Beta-Popup will tell about Beta2, while "license" still has Alpha0 in its context.

A detailed [changelog](//www.opensuse-education.org/download/repo/1.0/11.1/ChangeLog) is also available. So left to say: Have a lot of fun testing openSUSE and Education!

Thanks to all for packaging, testing and/or discussing (in IRC on #opensuse-edu or in our [mailinglist](//lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-edu/))!
