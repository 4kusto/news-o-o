![openSUSE-Education Logo](//files.opensuse.org/opensuse/en/f/f8/OpenSUSE-Edu.png)Good things come to those who wait: I think we've waited long enough to release the first openSUSE-Education version for openSUSE 10.3.

Just use the YaST2 "Add-On Product" module to add our [Online-Repository](//www.opensuse-education.org/download/repo/1.0/10.3/). A more detailed description can be found at the [openSUSE wiki](//en.opensuse.org/Education/Repositories).

For those without permanent Internet connection, we've created a DVD ISO which can be downloaded here:


[ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/education/openSUSE-Education-1.0-for-10.3.iso](ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/education/openSUSE-Education-1.0-for-10.3.iso) (3,7GB)


To give new users a hint how to install the DVD, we've created PDFs in [english](//www.opensuse-education.org/download/ISOs/installation_on_10_3.pdf), [german](//www.opensuse-education.org/download/ISOs/installation_auf_10_3.pdf) and [italian](//www.opensuse-education.org/download/ISOs/installazione_10.3.pdf) language containing all needed information and in addition some descriptions for [LTSP](//en.opensuse.org/LTSP), [GCompris](//en.opensuse.org/GCompris), [iTalc](//en.opensuse.org/Italc) and [Tuxpaint.](//en.opensuse.org/Tuxpaint) We want to reuse existing wiki articles for this in 11.0 and add these descriptions also to the Helpcenter. The PDFs are also available in the documentation directory of the DVD.

<!-- more -->**And what's new?**

We've currently 3.7GB (!) of software on the Education DVD (2,4GB for each arch) - a huge progress compared to 10.2 with ~1,2GB for each architecture. But: some applications cover nearly the same area - so we need your help by dividing the "good" from the "not so good" for the next release.

A big part is consumed by the LTSP5 stuff, which is now available completely for openSUSE using KIWI. Thanks to [CyberOrg](//en.opensuse.org/User:Cyberorg) for all the effort he put in this area!

Having already some KDE 4 Applications on the 10.2 release, we now focus on the different compiler languages and Integrated Development Plattforms (like gambas2, netbeans, free pascal, ...). We still have ~50 new packages on our ToDo list - but with over 800 packages on the media, there should already be a package available which is useful for everybody.

You can get a small foretaste of all the available applications in the [openSUSE-Wiki](//en.opensuse.org/Education/Applications). Hopefully the descriptions of all applications will grow in the next months, so we can add them to the PDFs.

I also like to give a big "Thank YOU" to all the other fighters in the Education Team (especially for this release):



	
  * Andrea ([anubisg1](//en.opensuse.org/User:Anubisg1)) for packaging and translation into italian

	
  * Andreas ([a_ochs](//en.opensuse.org/User:Aochs)) for packaging and translation into german

	
  * Kirill ([kkirill](//en.opensuse.org/User:Kkirill)) for his hard testing and packaging (and improving the russian language support on openSUSE ;-)

	
  * ...and all the other "guest" entries in our [bugzilla](//bugs.opensuse-education.org), IRC comments, Emails, packaging help, ...


PS: We've also added some "easter eggs" to the DVD (regards to Seminarix and others ![;-)](https://imap.suse.de/horde/themes/graphics/emoticons/wink.png) - looking out for people reporting them...
