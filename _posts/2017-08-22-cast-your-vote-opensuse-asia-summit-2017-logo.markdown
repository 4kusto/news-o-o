Following the announcement of our logo contests, thanks to our awesome community as usual, we now have several logos. Choosing the best of them off course was a lot of work for us and so the [openSUSE.Asia Summit](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/summitasia17) committee has decided that the community will choose its own logo for the summit.

![](/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/logos.png)We are happy to announce that following our [Call for Logo Design](https://news.opensuse.org/2017/07/14/opensuse-asia-summit-2017-logo-competition/), we are opening our “Choose our Logo” Elections where “You” vote for the best. The voting period is until August 31 and the entries can be viewed [here](https://vote.opensuse-asia.org/).

Note that in order to view candidates or vote, you need SUSE ID. Please click 'Sign in with SUSE' button and log in with your ID and password. If you do not have that ID, you can create a new ID by clicking that button.

The final decision will be made by [openSUSE.Asia Summit](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/summitasia17) Committee based on the score. It may not be the highest scored design.

Remember, it is your summit, so every input is appreciated.
