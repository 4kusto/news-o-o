Delayed by a week due to a critical bug that would have prevented testing, the openSUSE project today announces openSUSE 11.4 Milestone 3 (M3), the third of six milestone releases of what will become openSUSE 11.4. The bug, [a crash in the software rasterizer](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=641297) of the Mesa OpenGL stack, was found by our automated test suite and the openSUSE XOrg developers swung into action so that KDE would work on systems without hardware acceleration, which includes most virtual machines.[![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/20101111_002-300x225.jpg)](https://news.opensuse.org/2010/11/11/opensuse-11-4m3/20101111_002-2/)

systemd, the alternative init system, becomes available for testing in M3 with version 11. Â ï»¿To test systemd, install it, then reboot with init=/bin/systemd [as described by Andreas Jaege](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/10/08/systemd-and-osc2010/)r. Otherwise, the existing SysV init is used.

M3 includes [Gnome 2.32](http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.32/) on the desktop, including metacontact support in the Empathy instant messenger and [Banshee 1.8](http://banshee.fm/download/archives/1-8-0/) with Amazon MP3 store plugin,Â [KDE 4.5.3](http://kde.org/announcements/announce-4.5.3.php), and a number of independent updates including [version 0.11 of the Arora browser](http://arorabrowser.blogspot.com/2010/09/arora-0110.html), the chemistry tool [Avogadro 1.0.1](http://avogadro.openmolecules.net/wiki/Avogadro_1.0.1) and Licq 1.5, introducing XMPP support to this venerable IM client.

On the productivity front, M3 includes [LibreOffice 3.2.99](http://www.documentfoundation.org/download/), Â a host of additional optional packages for KOffice such as [lcms2](http://www.littlecms.com/index.html) giving better colour management and image processing options, andÂ [Digikam 1.5.0](http://www.digikam.org/drupal/node/539) including automated lens correction while batch processing multiple images,

[Mono 2.8](http://www.mono-project.com/Release_Notes_Mono_2.8) replaces Mono 2.6 and adds C# 4.0, an new garbage collector and many performance improvements.

At the lower level, Linux kernel 2.6.36 is in, along withÂ [smartmontools 5.40](http://www.wireshark.org/docs/relnotes/wireshark-1.4.0.html) bringsÂ SSD support, and Wireshark 1.4 brings many performance improvements and memory footprint reductions.

Due to a new liblzma, delta ISOs from M2 to M3 must be applied using a new version of deltarpm. Â Stephan Kulow provides this in his [home:coolo](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/coolo/openSUSE_Factory/) Build Service project.

A list of [most annoying bugs](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Most_annoying_bugs_11.4_dev#openSUSE_11.4_Milestone_3_of_6) can be found here. We look forward toÂ [your bug reports](http://bugzilla.novell.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=openSUSE+11.4&format=guided) and test experiences. Automated testing and the openSUSE Factory team have been active to ensure that[ your download of Â M3](http://software.opensuse.org/developer) will be at least minimally functional.

The next milestoneÂ [is scheduled](http://www.suse.de/~coolo/opensuse_11.4/) for November 25. Â openSUSE 11.4 is planned to be released in March 2011.
