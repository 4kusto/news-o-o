[openSUSE 12.1 RC1 spotted in the wild](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/10/24/opensuse-12-1-rc1-spotted-in-the-wild/)

As was already [blogged by Vincent Untz](http://www.vuntz.net/journal/post/2011/10/24/openSUSE-12.1-RC1-is-out%2C-with-GNOME-3.2.1), a few weeks after our [last milestone was released as beta 1](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/09/06/opensuse-celebrates-beta-1-with-pizzabeta-parties/), the first Release Candidate of [openSUSE 12.1](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:12.1%22) is now floating over the

      [Help out with testing at
        openSUSE](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/10/25/testing-at-opensuse/)
    

One of the most important activities during software development is testing. In FOSS
      community, software often gets tested by the developers themselves, other developers and
      volunteers. During the [openSUSE 12.1](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:12.1)
      development process it has been important to keep [Factory](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Factory) working properly. Testing this
      is however a rather boring, repetitive task: the tester has to boot up a Factory ISO as often
      as possible and check if the basic applications start up and work. We don’t like boring tasks
      so the openSUSE Project has been using the automated testing framework [openQA](http://openqa.opensuse.org) to test this release daily!

This article explains how **openQA** works and how you can
      help keep Factory working! We’ll also give some links to more information about testing to
      help new testers learn the trade but also give experienced testers some new tips and insights!

            [Look at plymouth for splash during boot (Score: 201)](https://features.opensuse.org/305493)
          

I wanted to open a fate feature about this when I first heard of plymouth, but
            reading
            http://fedoramagazine.wordpress.com/2008/10/21/interview-fedora-10s-better-startup/
            really makes me think we should go this way.

Ray's comment starting with "Every flicker and mode change in the boot
            process takes away from the whole experience." is especially interesting. Is it
            okay to track the "don't show grub by default" here?

An easy way to remove Software! For example: you installed an application with "1-click install" (which will install all the packages that you need), there should be an easy way (also with 1 click) to remove what you have installed with that 1-click operation... in another words: an "1-click Uninstall" to remove installed software (dependencies and packages included).

            [Update to GRUB v2 (Score: 161)](https://features.opensuse.org/308497)
          

Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn't
            going to go away. The code itself isn't well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It's only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don't have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

I am not the person who does distro upgrades because I like to have a fresh system when a new version is out. I have a seperate home partition, so I only have to install the system and mount my home.

After setup there is always the same procedure: I have to reinstall all the software which I use at my daily work and which not has been installed during setup. So I have a txt-file with a list and install every package manually. This is stupid work and often I forget something and notice is later. That is annoying.

It would be very comfortable to have a list of package that will be available after setup. Regardles if the package is installed by default or not the installer takes a look at this list and installs every package which is not installed. (...)

        [Wazi/Juliet Kemp: Git Tutorial: Branching and Merging](http://olex.openlogic.com/wazi/2011/git-tutorial-branching-and-merging/)
      

One of the most compelling features of the [Git](http://olex.openlogic.com/packages/git) version control system (VCS) is its ability to create highly usable and lightweight branches, and the ease of merging those branches later. Branching creates multiple “copies” of the same repository and allows you to separate out a set of changes while you experiment with them, or to create different versions of a project, without affecting the main tree. It’s a feature that developers sometimes don’t make the most of, simply because branching is so much more costly in other VCSes that they’re not used to it, or they’re not aware of the many branch commands and tricks available in Git. Here’s a host of useful tips to get your Git branching and merging skills up to expert level in no time. (...)

        [Pascal Bleser: Loop mount iso files without being root](http://dev-loki.blogspot.com/2011/10/loop-mount-iso-files-without-being-root.html)
      

There is a rather convenient way to mount ISO files (CD/DVD images) onto a directory on Linux, which goes as follows:
mount -o loop,ro /path/to/image.iso /path/to/mountpoint
(where the mountpoint is a directory).

This method works very well, but has one essential drawback: you must be root in order to do that. So how do I get to do so as a regular user ?

A barely known alternative lies in [fuseiso](http://freshmeat.net/projects/fuseiso), which uses the [FUSE](http://fuse.sourceforge.net/) filesystem in user-space layer to accomplish that. (...)

        [LinuxCareer/Jonathan Cox: How to Make a Basic Intrusion Detection System with Bash](http://how-to.linuxcareer.com/how-to-make-a-basic-intrusion-detection-system-with-bash)
      

**1. Introduction**

For most of us WEP encryption has become a joke.  WPA is quickly going the same way thanks to many tools such as Aircrack-ng. On top of this, wired networks are no strangers to unwanted guests as well.  Anyone serious about security should have a good Intrusion Detection system in their toolbox.

There are already some very good IDS's (Intrusion Detection Systems) available.  Why would anyone want to re-invent the wheel in Bash???  There are a couple of reasons for this.  Obviously Bash scripts can be very light weight.  Especially compared to some of the GUI programs that are out there.  While programs like Etherape suck us in with pretty colors, they require constant monitoring to know when the network has changed.  If you are like most of us, you only use the computer for two things, work and play.  By using the system bell to alert for new clients online you can leave this script running and not have to have a constant watch. If you do decide you want to inspect what a suspicious client is doing more closely, you can always open up etherape, wireshark, or your tool of choice.  But until you have a problem you can play or work on other things. (...)

In addition to or instead of functioning as a server on a Windows network, a Linux® computer can function as a client. You can use an ftp-like program to transfer files and modify a server, or you can mount a share from a Samba or Windows® Server machine on your Linux computer, giving normal programs the ability to access files directly on the server. When doing so, though, keep in mind the characteristics of the original SMB protocol and its newer CIFS variant, particularly when accessing a Windows Server machine: You may not have access to all the file system features that a Linux computer supports.

[Jim
        Fehlig: Updated libvirt for openSUSE12.1 RC1](https://jfehlig.wordpress.com/2011/10/25/updated-libvirt-for-opensuse12-1-rc1/)

Last week I updated the libvirt package for openSUSE12.1 RC1 / Factory to version 0.9.6.
      The package was also submitted for SLE11 SP2 Beta8. Changes since last update include
      backporting of AHCI controller patch for qemu driver. With this patch it is possible to use
      SATA drives with qemu instances. The following controller device XML is used to specify an
      AHCI controller
      

<controller type='sata' index='0'>
  <address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0x00' slot='0x05' function='0x0'/>
</controller

The
      libvirt qemu driver supports many AHCI controllers, each with one bus and 6 units. To attach a
      SATA disk to a unit on an AHCI controller, use the following disk device XML
      

<disk type='file' device='disk'>
  <driver name='qemu' type='raw'/>
  <source file='/var/lib/libvirt/images/test/disk0.raw'/>
  <target dev='sda' bus='sata'/>
  <address type='drive' controller='0' bus='0' unit='0'/>
</disk 

Also new to this libvirt update is opt-in for Apparmor confinement of qemu instances.
      /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf has been patched to explicitly set the security driver to ‘none’. If
      Apparmor is enabled on the host, libvirtd is generously confined since it needs access to many
      utilities and libraries, but users must opt-in to also have qemu instances launched by
      libvirtd confined. Simply edit /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf and change security_driver to
      ‘apparmor’. Of course, selinux is also available if users prefer it over Apparmor.

[Cornelius Schumacher: Introducing Inqlude, the Qt library archive](http://blog.cornelius-schumacher.de/2011/10/introducing-inqlude-qt-library-archive.html)

Today I would like to introduce you to [Inqlude](http://inqlude.org/),
      the Qt library archive. The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive listing of all
      existing libraries for developers of Qt applications. So if you are creating applications
      using the [Qt toolkit](http://qt-project.org/), and are looking for

[Coffee
      talk with Michael Miller](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/10/26/coffee-talk-with-michael-miller/)

Friday 16.09, while working on the [openSUSE 12.1](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:12.1) marketing actions during the [Marketing Hackfest](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:12.1_Marketing_Hackfest),
      two of us had the spontaneous idea to suggest an interview to Michael Miller([Vice President of Global Alliances
        & Marketing for SUSE](http://www.suse.com/company/executive-management/)), asking him a few questions we could have in the openSUSE
      community. We did not have the time to go around, to find the FAQ or to choose the “best
      questions”. It was kind of “shall we do that, around a cup of coffee ? Why not ?”. And Michael
      Miller accepted our proposition, without any objection or any “joker’s need”. (...)

[Internet at openSUSE Conference 2011](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/10/25/internet-at-opensuse-conference-2011/)

At the openSUSE conference 2011, there was especially one area that caused us the previous
      years some trouble and this year nobody spoke about since it just worked fine: Wireless
      internet access.

So, what have we done right this year? It was basically wiring internet ourselves to the
      location and setting up the wifi controllers sponsored by Aeroaccess.

We were lucky that SUSE’s internet provider M-Net had a fibre channel cable in the cellar
      of the building and negotiated a special short-term package with 100 MBit/s for the
      conference. (...)

      The title this time is not a link to a single thread, but to the Pre-release/Beta subforums. Reason for this is the growing number of threads concerning the upcoming release of openSUSE 12.1. More and more people are starting to try and test the RC1, reporting issues, or complete success. Until the official release this subforum will be the one to watch if you're interested in user experience, problems etc.

      Not all of us have a high speed, stable internet connection. This thread reports download errors, which result in corrupted iso files, install media not passing the media verification etc. Bypassing a corrupt download is not possible, sometimes it can lead to unwanted surprising results. There's a couple of posts in this thread with useful tips for those users who meet trouble in this area.

      The openSUSE forums are the place where support in using openSUSE can be found. Here we have an example of what "support" can imply. A user asks the other members for advice on buying a new video card. There are numerous sites to check hardware compatibility for linux, but this is a nice way as well, just ask the others for their suggestions.

        [InternetNews.com/Sean Michael Kerner: SUSE Builds OpenStack Diablo Appliances](http://www.internetnews.com/blog/skerner/suse-builds-openstack-diablo-appliances.html)
      

From the 'Cloud Rules' files:

You can add SUSE to the long list of vendors that with OpenStack solution.

OpenStack is the open source cloud platform that now has well over 80 member companies participating. What SUSE is doing is interesting, in that they're making an OpenStack distribution available.

So instead of just 'pledging' to work with OpenStack and have some kind of OpenStack based solution, SUSE is actually providing OpenStack, running on SUSE Enterprise Linux. (...)

        [ZDNet/Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols: Consumer Electronics Linux Initiative Starts](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/consumer-electronics-linux-initiative-starts/9820)
      

Many people use Linux every day and never know it. Indeed, they’re often using Linux without even knowing they’re using a computing device. For years now, Linux has been the operating system of choice for Digital Video Recorders (DVR)s, DVD players, Smart TVs, Wi-Fi access points, GPS devices, and on and on. But, there’s never been a Linux kernel just for consumer electronics… until now.

At [LinuxCon Europe](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon-europe) in Prague, Czech Republic, The [Linux Foundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/), the non-profit organization dedicated to promoting Linux, announced that it was hosting a new project created by its Consumer Electronics (CE) workgroup: the [Long Term Support Initiative (LTSI)](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/celf).

This week, SUSE [announced that it had joined OpenStack](http://www.suse.com/blogs/suse-joins-openstack/) and today the company announced [a development preview of SUSE Cloud](http://susegallery.com/a/vszMWq/suse-cloud-powered-by-openstacktm) which is powered by OpenStack. With the green team at SUSE behind OpenStack, along with Canonical, does that make OpenStack the de facto open source cloud? Not so fast – I wouldn't count Red Hat out just yet.

[OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org/), the open source cloud infrastructure being developed by more than 125 organizations, should need no introduction. Red Hat is going its own way in the clouds, with [CloudForms](http://www.redhat.com/solutions/cloud/cloudforms/) for its Infrastructure-as-a-Service (Iaas) offering, and [OpenShift](http://www.redhat.com/solutions/cloud/openshift/) for its Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering.

        [Phoronix/Michael Larabel: Skype Publishes New Linux APIs w/ Video Support](http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTAwNjY)
      

Skype, now [under the control of Microsoft](http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=OTQyNw), has announced a new developer preview of SkypeKit. It surprisingly brings good news for Linux users.

SkypeKit allows desktop applications to integrate Skype functionality into partner applications while the Skype desktop API allows developers to extend the functionality of the Skype client.

[SkypeKit was originally rolled out in June](SkypeKit was originally rolled out in June) to help Skype in the consumer electronics industry. Skype developers have been working to improve SkypeKit since and today released a developer preview of SkypeKit 4.02. This new version does bring video APIs to "SkypeKit for Desktop", so that developers can build in native Skype functionality into their own applications for handling video calls. There's also a new "Skype App Directory" that's being rolled out too.

SkypeKit is available for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows operating systems. (...)

        [Network World/Rikki Endsley: Open Source: You Know, For Kids!](http://www.networkworld.com/community/open-source-for-kids)
      

A few years ago, when I was working as a print magazine editor, a young girl approached my booth at LinuxFest Northwest in Bellingham, Washington. She was probably 12- or 13-years old, and she gave me some of the best feedback I'd ever had on our products.

**Reason 1: You Will Learn**

My new young friend told me what she liked about our articles, the art, and even our ads. She pointed out that one of our ads looked too much like an ad a hosting provider was running, and she was right. She told me that I needed to give out stickers for her and other attendees to put on their laptops, which I immediately ordered after the event. I thanked her for stopping and taking the time to make me look at our magazines from a fresh perspective. (...)

        [LinuxCareer/Reres Aioanei: How can you help the Linux community](http://how-to.linuxcareer.com/how-can-you-help-the-linux-community)
      

**1. Introduction**

The whole Linux community is based on the concept of community and collaboration. Without it, Linus Torvalds' e-mail sent out 20 years ago would have been forgotten and none of us would have known about Linux. As time went by, it became easier and easier for users, regardless of experience and knowledge, to contribute to his/her favorite distribution. While we're at it, it's a common misconception that you have to be a programmer in order to help the Linux community. Well, nothing could be further from the truth.  Anyone can help, provided he or she has Internet access, and, more importantly, the will to help. You are not expected to have any particular knowledge, just to have a few hours/week available for this. This article will not be specific to a distribution or another, because there are hundreds of them and anyway, the general concepts are the same. (...)

**While spam continues to be a major problem for email providers and consumers, spammers have come up with a new way to hide links and slip through the spam filters.**

According to new information from researchers at Symantec, a group of spammers have created a group of 87 spam-friendly, public URL shortening services and are actively using them to circumvent spam filters on popular sites. Using URL shortening scripts that are free and open source, the spammers are churning spam through the service and the public is also free to create links through the URL shorteners, perhaps an attempt to pass off the links as legitimate. All the URL shorteners are using the .info domain and are being operated through contacts in Moscow as well as a hosting company in the United Kingdom. (...)
