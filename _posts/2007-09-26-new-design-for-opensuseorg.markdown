We launched the new shiny design for the [wiki](//en.opensuse.org) on Monday. It was a little rough but we sorted out most of the bugs, even the newsfeed is working again :-). Now we have a more unified look of all openSUSE pages, just compare [news](//news.opensuse.org), [download](//download.opensuse.org) and the [wiki](//en.opensuse.org). Thanks to all who helped us to make this great redesign!

For all wiki maintainers: please look at Frank's [HOWTO](//lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-wiki/2007-09/msg00048.html) mail on the wiki mailinglist.

 You may choose a program [online essay writer with https://pro-essay-writer.com](https://pro-essay-writer.com/) that is concentrated on one of these areas, or you may prefer one that is more general in nature
