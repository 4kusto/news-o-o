      [A new milestone on the cloud: openSUSE releases milestone 3](//news.opensuse.org/2011/07/22/a-new-milestone-on-the-cloud-opensuse-releases-milestone-3/)
    

Just a few days ago the third of six milestones on the road ftoopenSUSE 12.1 has been
        made [available](//software.opensuse.org/developer/en) for testing
      before it goes to final release November 11th, 2011.  (Yes, 11-11-11!)

**Main changes on this milestone**

The third milestone has a huge number of changes and improvements on top of the latest
      openSUSE release. And many packages have been updated or upgraded. You can check the latest
      package versions on [this page](//en.opensuse.org/index.php?title=openSUSE:Factory_versions&diff=cur&oldid=40501). What are the major changes?

  * Firefox 5

  * MozillaThunderbird 5.0

  * aaa_base 12.1

  * Kernel 3.0 rc7

  * Python3   3.2

  * Sysstat 10.0.1

  * LibreOffice 3.3.3.1

  * Tomboy 1.7.1

  * Tracker 0.11.0

  * many smaller updates to KDE and GNOME applications and desktops

**Systemd needs your feedback**

The team welcomes help and bugreports as we prepare for the first release of openSUSE to
      use systemd.

**Hands on to help out easier than ever!**

Your input at this early development stage is a great opportunity to collaborate in making
      the final release into the polished work we always prosecute for. openSUSE 12.1 Milestone 3
      has a [list of most
        annoying bugs here](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Most_annoying_bugs_12.1_dev), please add issues you find and help fix them. As Will Stephenson
        has [already
        blogged](//lizards.opensuse.org/2011/05/16/have-you-burped-yet-today/), fixing an issue is a matter of**BURP**ing
        on [build.opensuse.org](//build.opensuse.org/)! Find a how-to [here](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_Collaboration#Example_with_web_interface).

      [Last Call for openSUSE Conference Papers!](//news.opensuse.org/2011/07/22/last-call-for-opensuse-conference-papers/)
    

With the days closing in on us before the next great openSUSE Conference in Nuremberg,
      Germany 11-14 September, 2011, we’re seeing a lot of awesome papers being submitted to the
      Conference Program Committee.  But there’s still time for you to submit that awesome session
      you’ve dreamed of. The deadline to [submit your
        paper](//conference.opensuse.org/indico//conferenceDisplay.py?confId=2)is [midnight July 25th](//www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=25&month=7&year=2011&hour=0&min=0&sec=0&p1=0).

**What We Are Looking For:**

This year’s Conference theme is RWX³.  That means its an open conference in which we all
      get to roll up our sleeves and get involved!  We’re looking for that great session that talks
      about FOSS projects, openSUSE Community growth, and  workshops that empower our users and
      contributors to do more awesome stuff.

**Types of Sessions you can apply for**

  * Presentation

  * [Birds of a Feather (BoF)](//news.opensuse.org/2011/06/14/opensuse-conference-and-rw-sessions-the-bof/)

  * [Workshops](//news.opensuse.org/2011/07/13/opensuse-and-rw-sessions-the-workshop/)

  * Hacksessions

As you can see, the possibilities are endless.  And this year’s conference, which is
      always free, is extra special because we’ll be moving to our new location, Zentrifuge, and
      co-hosting with the SUSE Labs Conerence.  That’s two for the price of one and one is
      FREE!

**What’s Next**

  * Submit your proposal [here](//conference.opensuse.org/indico//conferenceDisplay.py?confId=2)

  * The Program Committee will be reviewing all submissions and making their votes
            before August 1.

  * After August 5, we will announce the accepted proposals and contact you with the
            status of your proposal.

Remember, the deadline is this **Sunday, July 24th**!

      [Alex Eftimie: PackageKit backend for Software Center: short week 7 report](//alex.eftimie.ro/2011/07/17/packagekit-backend-for-software-center-short-week-7-report/)
    

Short weekly report is short, this week’s achievements:

  * fixed the install/remove simulation bits (it can now tell what packages will be
            removed after applying changes)

  * improved PackageInfo testing (works with both AptCache and PackageKit)

  * found the problem with dynamic/static libs conflict: it is gio statically
            loaded from gtk and then Gio dynamically loaded from PackageKitGlib; loading Gio before
            everything seems to fix the conflict for now;

  * got another [round](//code.launchpad.net/~alexeftimie/software-center/backend-refactor) of refactor changes into trunk, thanks to mvo; this way my PK branch is
            one step closer to merging into software-center

      [Marcus Hüwe: osc code cleanup – summary of week 8](//lizards.opensuse.org/2011/07/17/gsoc-osc-code-cleanup-–-summary-of-week-8/)
    

Here’s a small summary of the 8th (coding) week. This week I spentmost of my time with
      rewriting the working copy code.

Done:

  * added support to add and delete packages

  * added some “abstractions” for the tracking file format:currently packages and files
            are tracked in a xml file

  * thought about the package update algorithm. Basicallyit’ll work like this (verfy
            simplified version):

    * perform update in a tmpdir (phase 1)

    * if the tmp update finished, copy/rename all files tothe wc (phase 2)

Advantage:If the update is interrupted in phase 1 the wc wasn’t touchedat all
                  and nothing should be broken.If the update is interrupted in phase 2 the wc is
                  _inconsistent_but a subsequent “update” call can resume the update and
                  everythingshould be consistent afterwards (in this case only files
                  arecopied/renamed)

TODO:

  * implement update + commit algorithm

If everything works as expected most parts of working copy codecleanup should be finished
      after this week.

      [Christos Bountalis: A utility for merging configuration / sysconfig files – Week 9
        Report](//cbounta.wordpress.com/2011/07/22/a-utility-for-merging-configuration-sysconfig-files-week-9-report/)
    

Exciting news for the project this week. After solving the problem with the comments and
      the tree representation of the sysconfig files in Augeas, there was a big leap in the
      project’s progress. By having test data and through debugging i was able to complete the match
      algorithm.The program is now able to traverse through two trees / files, make the necessary
      matches between the nodes of these two trees and provide the appropriate information to the
      later stages. That of merging.

What exactly have been done in the previous week:

  * Tree representation of sysconfig files

  * Matching between two trees nodes completed

  * Sorting of labels (Small Fixes)

  * tree_compare function complete

  * Tree traversal of aug_process_trees ( revisited)

What is for next week:

  * Finish merging functions for aug_process_trees ( I feel optimistic that i will
            surely complete this next week due to the reason that matching was completed)

  * Create first beta packages

  * Test Test Test

  * Improve code

      [David Williams: Entomologist UI Changes - Weekly Report #9](//redache.wordpress.com/2011/07/23/entomologist-ui-changes-weekly-report-9/)
    

This week I’ve been working on finishing up the ToDo Lists, which did entail writing a new
      Item Delegate for the list as the previous method of checking which widget had been clicked
      was less than optimal!. I have finished the ToDo List and it will hopefully be merged on
      Monday into an experimental branch that I can go through and ensure that everything works as
      expected. This will then all be pulled together as a possible version 1.0 of Entomologist,
      which is great news!.

I am currently researching possibilities for integrating Cloud Services into the ToDo List
      and I plan on targeting an iCal/WebDAV compatible format export to begin with. Once this basic
      step is in place I can then look at integrating with various web services and generic
      iCal/WebDAV support for servers that use these.

This all leads on to how long I have left of my GSoC, which by my count is 5 weeks(!) of
      GSoC Time,but I would like to stick to the soft pencils down date as much as possible so the
      final week can be spent ensuring everything works properly. I want to look at the addition of
      QML after I’ve integrated some Cloud Sync aspects as I think this would be a really excellent
      feature to have.

Here’s a screenshot of the ToDo List on OS X Lion (Which also shows that nothing has to be
      done to Entomologist’s code base to make it compatible):

        [Andreas
          Jaeger: Factory Progress 2011-07-18](//lizards.opensuse.org/2011/07/18/factory-progress-2011-07-18/)
      

I’ve noticed the following changes that might interest people using and developing
        openSUSE Factory:

**Package changes**

**GNOME 3.1.3**

The GNOME team plans to have GNOME 3.2 in for openSUSE 12.1 and thus have updated to the
        current development release 3.1.3. They have also started removing old GNOME 2 packages that
        are not needed anymore.

**systemd**

Frederic gave an [update](//lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2011-07/msg00288.html) on
        systemd integration. The graphical bootloader allows now to switch during boot between
        systemd, SysVinit and also shell code.

Also, Lennart Poettering wrote in his “systemd for developers” series about [socket
        activation](//0pointer.de/blog/projects/socket-activation2.html) where he uses cups as example.

**hal**

The hal daemon has been dropped from Factory after all users with clean spec files have
        been changed to work with the successors of hal like udisk and udev.

**samba**

Samba is getting updated to [3.6.0](//lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2011-07/msg00261.html), one
        of its major [features](//ftp.samba.org/pub/samba/rc/WHATSNEW-3-6-0rc2.txt) is full SMB2 support.

**Linux Kernel Headers**

Linux kernel 2.6.38 removed the Video for Linux v1 support and also the file
        linux/videodev.h. Since we now use the Linux Kernel 3.0, applications using the old
        interface need to be converted. A replacement is libv4l1-videodev.h from libv4l-dev >=
        0.8.4.

**Keeping old kernel(s) while installing new ones**

Michal Marek descripes in his [blog ](//lizards.opensuse.org/2011/07/14/improved-kernel-package-retention-in-12-1/)how it’s possible to configure which kernels to keep installed when a new
        one gets installed. With a simple change to the zypp configuration, you can define e.g. that
        you always like to keep the latest running kernel when you install a new one.

**Upcoming Features**

A new page called “[upcoming features](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Upcoming_features)” has been created to point out new features for the next
        release. Please help updating the page with new information.

**Policy and tool changes**

**Directories not owned by a package**

We have now enabled a build time check that all directories are owned by a package and
        this hit [49
          package](//lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-packaging/2011-07/msg00011.html)s, most of them are fixed by now but packagers should fix the remaining
        onw.

**Other interesting bits**

**openSUSE 11.4 Milestone 3**

Coolo announced that [milestone 3 is
          delayed](//lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2011-07/msg00227.html) due to some kernel bugs which the testing team encountered with their
        daily testing scripts.  On 2011-07-18 the 3.0 RC7 kernel was checked in and should fix
        this.

**openSUSE Conference**

The call for papers is continuing to run, please submit session proposals at the [conference site](//conference.opensuse.org/indico/). Also, [registration](//news.opensuse.org/2011/07/14/opensuse-conference-registration-open/) is open now.

          [Henne Vogelsang:
            What are the boosters up to?](//blog.hennevogel.de/what-are-the-boosters-up-to-6/)
        

**Members 1st**

This time around the Boosters took on a milestone for the benefit of the Membership
          Officials team. To explain who they are and what they do we have to look a bit further
          into the openSUSE Project. Because of its history and relatively young age the project is
          trying very hard to avoid hierarchies, policies and rules. It emphasizes the creative, a
          bit chaotic, side of the FOSS ways for openSUSE to get things done, quickly. Everyone that
          is participating is equal, everyone that is participating is following the same [Guiding Principles.](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Guiding_principles) The
          only formal structure is a a group of [“Primus inter
            pares”](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primus_inter_pares), that is elected to provide guidance according to the
          principles: The [Board](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board).

But how do you identify who is participating? How do you get affiliated with the
          project? Who is a member? The Board came up with this
          definition: Everyone who contributes**continued and
            substantial **to the project. As you can imagine there are a million and one
          ways to contribute to a huge project like ours, so judging if someones contributions
            are**continued and substantial **can only be done on a case
          by case basis. The [Membership Officials](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Membership_officials) are tasked by the Board to do this evaluation.

The process to become a member is dead easy. You tell the Membership Officials that
          you want to be a Member and what you have done so far. They will then evaluate your
          contributions and vote on your request. Once your request gets more then four positive
          votes, you’re a Member. If you get four negative votes you get rejected. (...)

            process takes away from the whole experience." is especially interesting. Is it
            okay to track the "don't show grub by default" here?

An easy way to remove Software! For example: you installed an application with "1-click install" (which will install all the packages that you need), there should be an easy way (also with 1 click) to remove what you have installed with that 1-click operation... in another words: an "1-click Uninstall" to remove installed software (dependencies and packages included).

Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn't
            going to go away. The code itself isn't well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It's only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don't have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

            [Preserve Running Kernel On Kernel
              Update by Default](https://features.opensuse.org/312647)
          

My suggestion is to enable multiversion kernel & preserve running kernel for
            safer kernel updates, to reduce support problems when new kernels won't boot. This is
            now possible for 12.1 by 1 line change to zypp.conf.Since Online Update was first
            introduced (SuSE 7.1?) it replaced the running kernel by default, which can lead to
            problems booting. For a while multiversion kernel has been supported by libzypp (1 line
            edit in zypp.conf). The drawback with multiversion was manual deletion required of
            unwanted kernel packages (see [//lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-kernel/2011-07/msg00056.html](//lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-kernel/2011-07/msg00056.html) ). Now in
            Factory 12.1 M3 Michel Marek has included & announced - kernel package retention
            options (see
            //lizards.opensuse.org/2011/07/14/improved-kernel-package-retention-in-12-1/ ).The
            default is sane, to preserve the Lastest & Running Kernels. So lets use it and make
            12.1 kernel updates safer for all, and by default do the right thing!

            [Automatically add keys to the
              ssh-agent at X11 login](https://features.opensuse.org/312649)
          

I'd like to have a simple way to have the ssh-agent load a number of keys
            automatically when I log in to the system. The simplest way in my opinion would be a
            directory, say ~/.ssh/ssh-add/, where the user can copy all the keys he wants to
            add. 

Currently ssh-agent is already started when the user logs in using X11 by
            /etc/X11/xdm/sys.xsession. /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc which runs a bit later also executes
            scripts in /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/. To me this seems the perfect place to add a small
            script containing the following
            lines:

#!/bin/bash if test -S
"$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" -a \ -x
"$SSH_ASKPASS" -a \ -d ~/.ssh/ssh-add;
  then ssh-add ~/.ssh/ssh-add/* <
  /dev/null fi

In fact, I use this script for a few years now. And I am sick of adding it to
            /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/ after each distribution update.

If I need to do a bisection to find a kernel fault, the number of kernels in the
            GRUB list gets very large.

The existing code handles the edit of /boot/grub/menu.lst; however, the kernels and
            modules that correspond to a deleted entry are orphaned. A manual cleanup of /boot and
            /lib/modules is tedious. An optional delete of the kernel files and modules would
            eliminate the tedium.

          [Larry
            Finger: Weekly News for July 23](//lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-testing/2011-07/msg00031.html)
        

The Testing Core Team held an IRC meeting at 17:00 UTC, July 18 on Channel
          #opensuse-testing on the Freenode IRC Network. irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-testing. 

Our first agenda item was for discussion of our experiences with 12.1 MS3. As this
          release was not available at that time, our discussion was limited. 

Our second agenda item concerned our request to rename MS6 to Beta in hopes of
          increasing the number of testers in the critical late stages of testing. As reported last
          week, Stephan Kulow, the Release Manager, has agreed to make the name change although he
          doubts that it will make much difference. He also asked how we will measure the effect of
          this change. 

We then discussed what metrics we might use to test the effectiveness of the name
          change. Thus far, only the number of downloads and the number of bug reports have been
          proposed. If you have any other suggestions, please send them to me. An interesting look
          at the number of bugs reported against release can be seen at //tinyurl.com/3mbrine
          for all versions since 11.2. The decrease in bugs against the Final makes it look as if we
          are doing something right. Of course, all statistics are lies! 

Our final item of discussion was planning our next Open Bugs Day, which will be held
          on August 21, 2011 from 0:00 to 23:59 UTC. This date is 10 days after the scheduled
          release of 12.1 MS4. The emphasis will be on testing whether bugs reported for 11.4 are
          still in 12.1. They will be fixed if possible, or updated to reflect the fact that they
          still exist. All individuals interested in making 12.1 be an exceptionally good release
          are welcome. As we get closer to the date, more specific instructions will be posted. As
          usual, we will have special on-line tools to help you select a bug for investigation. 

Our next IRC meeting will be at 17:00 UTC, July 25 on Channel #opensuse-testing on the
          Freenode IRC Network. irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-testing. We will discuss our
          experiences with MS3, now that it has been released.

[Bruno Friedmann: new package squidview available](//lizards.opensuse.org/2011/07/17/new-package-squidview-available/)

**squidview**

squidview is one of the software, I’ve always build and installed on each squid proxy
            server I build for me or customers. It’s small, stable, and usefull. So it was a clear
            real nice candidate to be use to improve my [obs](//openbuild-system.org/) and packager skiil.

I would like to thanks T1loc, yaloki, mrdocs, coolo, alin, and all others great
            packagers around, for helping and teaching me during the process.

**Introduction**

Squidview is an interactive console program which monitors and displays squid logs in
            a nice fashion, and may then go deeper with searching and reporting functions.

(If you don’t know what squid is or does this program is probably not for you.)

To use squidview you must at least have read access to squid’s access.log file. You
            may need to see your administrator for this. Squidview uses this text log file for all
            operations. It does not generate its own database for tasks.

Thomas Gleixner has released the first test version of a real-time (RT) Linux kernel based
      on a current release candidate of Linux kernel version 3.0; having been [slightly delayed](//www.h-online.com/news/item/Linux-kernel-3-0-slightly-delayed-1282429.html), version 3.0 is due to be [released](//thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.rt.user/6861) any day now. With
      version 3.0-rc7-rt0, the developers have taken the biggest step towards a modern basis for
        the [RT kernel](https://rt.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page), a kernel
      that is chiefly maintained by Gleixner and several other developers – the current stable
      kernel with real-time capabilities is still based on the Linux 2.6.33 series, which Greg
      Kroah-Hartman has [continued to maintain](//www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Further-problems-with-UEFI-1281549.html) specifically for the RT developers. (...)

[Linus Torvalds: Linux 3.0

So there it is. Gone are the 2.6.<bignum> days, and 3.0 is out.

This obviously also opens the merge window for the next kernel, whichwill be 3.1. The
      stable team will take the third digit, so 3.0.1 willbe the first stable release based on
      3.0.

As already mentioned several times, there are no special landmarkfeatures or
      incompatibilities related to the version number change,it's simply a way to drop an
      inconvenient numbering system in honor oftwenty years of Linux. In fact, the 3.0 merge window
      was calmer thanmost, and apart from some excitement from RCU I'd have called itreally smooth.
      Which is not to say that there may not be bugs, but ifanything, there are hopefully fewer than
      usual, rather than the normal".0" problems. (...)

[h-online/Thorsten Leemhuis: What's new in Linux 3.0](//www.h-online.com/open/features/What-s-new-in-Linux-3-0-1279552.html)

**The transition to the Linux kernel's 'third decade' sees numerous
        changes to the Btrfs filesystem. The kernel now includes all the major components needed to
        host guest systems under Xen and includes many new and revised drivers.**

Linus Torvalds and his collaborators have taken just two months to [complete](//thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1170070) the latest kernel.
      The most notable change, however, is cosmetic rather than technical – the transition from
      version 2.6.39 to 3.0. This not been taken as a cue to insert major changes, however, and the
      new kernel is in fact a perfectly normal version increment, following the pattern set for the
      2.6 series.

New features in Linux 3.0 include the addition of a storage backend for Xen, which means
      that the kernel now contains all the major components required to run as Dom0 – the merger of
      Xen support appeared tantalisingly close six years ago, but it has taken until now for it to
      actually happen. There have also been a number of changes to the Btrfs filesystem and to
      graphics drivers. Kernel developers have as ever also added several new drivers and have
      improved many existing drivers. (...)

        Torvalds: Linux 3.0 Delayed for Late Breaking Patch](https://plus.google.com/102150693225130002912/posts/2BXkWyrY4jH)

Why do we always find the subtle bugs just before a release?

Looks like I won't be releasing 3.0 today, just because Hugh found this incredibly subtle
      pathname lookup bug. We have a patch, we understand the problem, and it looks
      ObviouslyCorrect(tm), but I don't think I want to release 3.0 just a couple of hours after
      applying it.

Of course, the bug is so hard to see that Hugh needs weeks to reproduce it even with his
      stress test, so we could just ignore it and backport the fix later. But I really hate making
      releases with known issues even if it's almost certainly a "nobody will ever hit this in

      because of a pathname lookup bugand then some _more_ RCU issues.

Anyway, those should all be resolved and the fixes merged now, and I'mnot really all that
      nervous about the pathname lookup issue - I thinkthat got nailed, and the patch for that was
      literally just moving asingle line (and adding a comment).

The RCU issues worries me a bit, but everything says it's all good,and the biggest issues
      were with the new RCU_BOOST feature that reallyneither defaults to on, nor is suggested right
      now. So I think we'reok, and I'm planning on doing 3.0 tomorrow. (...)

        [Linux.com/Nathan Willis: Screencasting Stars of the Linux World](//www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/470411:screencasting-stars-of-the-linux-world)
      

Are you still taking screenshots? That is sooo last decade. Today if you want to
        showcase your application, your gaming skills, or even your astonishing new desktop
        wallpaper collection, you need a screen recorder (or screencasting tool) to capture
        full-motion video and audio of your desktop. You'll find several solid options, but which
        one works best for you depends a lot on the type of content you need to capture, and what
        you intend to do with it.For starters, the output produced by the tool varies considerably.
        Some alternatives give you a wide choice of video and audio codecs, others just one. But if
        that one (say, Flash) is the one you need, producing it directly is much quicker than having
        to save an intermediary file and crank it through a video editor. It also may be important
        to select just a portion of the screen rather than your whole display, or to choose a
        specific frame-rate (high for games, low for bandwidth-saving demos). Finally, there are
        always special features that vary between utilities, such as whether or not they can capture
        OpenGL content or be started remotely by script. (...)

Part of my daily routine envolves accessing and managing a considered amount of remote
        servers through the SSH protocol. I use screen a lot to ease the job by having a couple of
        windows opened on each server, so avoiding multiple connections to the same server. By using
        screen not only helps me grouping server windows altogether in one console window/tab but
        also is a time saver in those days when network connection is not in its glory days allowing
        me to reattach it and carrying on being productive (*sighs*). (...)

        [Vladimir Paskov: Using the rpm command –

RPM is a package management system widely used in various GNU/Linux distributions such
        as: openSUSE, RedHat, CentOS and Fedora. All this distributions provides various package
        management tools build around librpm (This library allows programs to make use of a rpm
        database or rpm packages without using the rpm command ) or making direct use of
        the rpm command. Examples of this includes: zypper – openSUSE package management tool andyum
        – Fedora and Red Hat package management tool. This tools provides easy to use functionality
        for installing, removing, searching, repository management etc, but they lack some
        functionality provided by the rpm command such as listing the contents of a package, finding
        what package provides some file etc.

This article will show you how you can use the rpm command to preform various package
        management task , such as installing, removing, querying the rpm database, etc…

          Inspector](//kdemonkey.blogspot.com/2011/07/qt-inspector.html)
      

Whilst debugging a widget layout problem a few days ago, I was looking around for a tool
        to view the structure of a Qt application without having to recompile it, or in other words,
        Firebug / Web Inspector for Qt widgets.  I found the [KSpy](//blogs.kde.org/node/799) tool in the KDE repositories which is in
        need of some love and there are a variety of tools to aid in runtime debugging and
        modification of QML but not much in the way of tools for QWidget-based interfaces.  Please
        let me know in the comments if I missed any.

I have put together a simple tool called [Qt Inspector](https://github.com/robertknight/Qt-Inspector).

Man     Shut up! (It goes quiet next door) That’s better.He walks to a side wall and
        hangs his club on a hook beneath big old-fashioned art-nouveau sign clearly labelled `The
        Burlington Wall-banger’. He goes across to bed and gets in. In the bed are a party of four

        riders, three Swedish businessmen, and Winston Churchill.

So far we have been dealing with a command line interface for working with our Python
        programs.  While command lines are good for a lot of things, they’re usually pretty bad for
        interfacing with a general user of the program who doesn’t know how the various pieces
        work.  What we are going to look at now is a different way of presenting the program to a
        user (and probably a way that you are more familiar with) – GUIs.   GUI stands for

        [Michael Gapczynski (MTGap): Testers needed for sharing files with ownCloud](//blog.gapinthecloud.com/2011/07/21/gsoc-testers-needed-for-sharing-files-with-owncloud/)
      

I have good news this week. First, I’m still here because I passed the mid-term
        evaluation for Google Summer of Code. Thanks for passing me Robin. Second, I was successful
        in completing my goal last week and now have everything setup so others can start
        experimenting with sharing files.

Besides general bug fixing this past week I’ve also refactored OC_SHARE, which is the
        class that handles the database records of all shared files in ownCloud. It started to get a
        little messy and I was unhappy with the quality of code so I rewrote many of the functions
        and moved some of the error handling into OC_FILESTORAGE_SHARED where it should belong. I
        also commented all of the functions so other developers can use OC_SHARE in their own apps
        and understand what it is doing. I’ve also added two hooks to OC_SHARE: post_delete and
        post_rename. These are triggered by OC_FILESYSTEM when files are deleted, renamed, or moved.
        The database gets updated when these actions occur in order to avoid any missing shared
        items.

The backend for sharing is pretty much complete so I can now focus on the user interface
        for the rest of the summer. The only part that needs updating is the permissions system. I
        was having a difficult time deciding on what to do with permissions and ended up going with
        only read and write, without the ability to permanently delete files. I’ve changed my mind
        now and will expand the options to more specific permissions that you can assign users. I
        was worried before that this would make the user interface too complex, but I now believe I
        can still achieve simplicity with the user experience. (...)
