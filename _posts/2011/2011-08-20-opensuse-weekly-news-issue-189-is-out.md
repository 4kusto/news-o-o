[Open Bugs
        Day on August 21](//news.opensuse.org/2011/08/20/open-bugs-day-on-august-21/)

The Testing Core Team has decided to hold our third [Open Bugs Day ](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Open-Bugs-Day)(OBD) on Sunday
      August 21 from 0:00 to 23:59 UTC.

To ensure that all the testers are using the same code base, we are making Virtual
      Machines available on our server. For those people that wish to test on their own hardware,
      there will be KDE and Gnome virtual images available at [//www5.zq1.de/img/](//www5.zq1.de/img/), and distribution snapshots available at [//mirror.zq1.de/opensuse/factory/iso/](//mirror.zq1.de/opensuse/factory/iso/). The virtual images have been prepared
      with KVM and tested with VirtualBox, and are compressed to a little over 900 MB. Instructions
      for using them in a VirtualBox VM are posted at the [Open Bugs Day wiki page](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Open-Bugs-Day).

The purpose of this OBD is to test the open bugs reported for openSUSE 11.4 to see which
      of them are still affecting 12.1. As there are over 1300 open bugs for 11.4, we have a major
      job to do. If you have any time available on August 21,ý please join us. Use Channel
      #opensuse-testing on the Freenode IRC Network to get started.

## openSUSE Conference 2011▲▼

[openSUSE Conference
      2011](//news.opensuse.org/2011/08/15/osc11/)

The third openSUSE Conference, **osc11**, kicks off on
      **Sunday September 11**, 2011 in **Nuremberg, Germany**. Under the motto **RWX** all
      Free and Open Source Software enthusiasts are invited to come together for four days
      to** learn**, **hack** and to
      **have a lot of fun**. The program will cover a variety topics
      with an emphasis on interaction between participants. The conference is **free of charge and open to anyone!**

**OSC – The annual meeting of the community**

![](/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/community.png)

The conference is the yearly get-together of the openSUSE community to give its people a
      chance to meet face to face, talk to and inspire each other. Having the chance to chat on the
      hallway, to quickly throw some ideas together on a whiteboard or to watch over each others
      shoulders while hacking can easily substitute endless chat sessions, thousand-mail threads on
      a mailing list and tiresome telephone calls. Being together in one room, even in this day and
      age, beats every other collaboration method and is what forges cohesion and friendships. That
      is why the openSUSE Project tries to get together this conference every year for its
      contributors. But not only for them, the conference is also for anyone using, working with or
      taking advantage of the project. No matter if you use our technology, if you are one of our
      many friends from free and open source upstream projects or if you contribute to another
      GNU/Linux distribution this conference is for you.

**Find more information about the conference, the program and the
      location at[//conference.opensuse.org](//conference.opensuse.org)**

**The Program – Everybody has to read, write and
      execute**

Last year, the conference had the motto [‘Collaboration Across Borders’](//news.opensuse.org/2011/08/15/?p=5223) and
      brought together an international crowd from many communities. This year we shift our
      attention a bit deeper, aiming for hands-on discussions to get work done. Smaller, more
      focused meetings with a strong “read-write” attitude are at the core of the conference. Hence
      the subtitle of **RWX^3**, commonly known as the UNIX acronym for
      “Read, Write, Execute” – three times, for you, your community and the rest of the
      world!

![](/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/intro.png)

The highlights, like every year, are the keynotes that kick of each day. This year our
      community manager Jos, kernel hacker Greg KH and Michael Miller, marketing vice president of
      SUSE will give the honors. Of course the general program also has a lot of highlights in the
      distribution, community and technology tracks.

Our distribution is, naturally, one of the topics which receives a lot of focus at our
      conference. Learn from Stefan Seyfried how to run the coolest bleeding edge stuff from the
      development tree while still retaining a reliable system that you can use for daily work. Let
      the Boosters teach you how to leave your own footprints in the distribution by becoming an
      contributor. Or get creative and work with other designers on the artwork for the desktops and
      applications 12.1 then and there.

Also the “soft topics” in (Free-) software engineering
      will get their share of attention. Lydia Pintscher gives a workshop to discuss a number of
      topics that often cause social problems in technical communities and Henne Vogelsang
      introduces you to the basics of citizen journalism so you can improve your blogging skills. Or
      how about you help to shape the future of the Ambassador program in a workshop with Kostas
      Koudaras and Manu Gupta?

Another cluster of topics will evolve around new technology that will bring FOSS and
      openSUSE forward. Robert Schweikert will give you an introduction to the basics of a cloud and
      an overview of the cloud projects in the Open Build Service. Brush up your debugging skills in
      a gdb workshop with Jýrgen Weigert or tag along for the journey of an I/O request through the
      kernel block layer with Suresh Jayaraman.

All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. So how
      about you visit the legen, wait for it…., dary social event on Monday at [“The Geek –
          Saloon and Dance Hall“](//conference.opensuse.org/social-event/), see some great musicians from the[ Fat Orange Collective](//fatorange.de/) live on the main stage or how
      about you let Winfried Appelt show you [highlights of his
        collection](/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/winfried.jpg) of over 800 ancient calculating machines?

And **let’s trow in a teaser**. There will be a contest
      related to openSUSE and yet Unidentified Flying Objects, with those UFO’s as prize!!!

**Find more information about the program, the keynotes, speakers and
      the social events at[//conference.opensuse.org/program](//conference.opensuse.org/program)**

**The Location – Work & Play**

![](/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/location1.png)

After two years at the Berufsförderungswerk [//www.bfw-nuernberg.de/](//www.bfw-nuernberg.de/) in
      the outskirts of Nýrnberg, we have found a new location smack in the middle of the city. 10
      minutes away from the center of Nürnberg, in a former production area of the **A**llgemeine **E**lektricitýts-**G**esellschaft (**AEG**), the conference
      will be hosted by the [Zentrifuge](//www.zentrifuge-nuernberg.de/). The Zentrifuge is a project that networks cultural
      interested and creative people in the region. The whole location has a special atmosphere of
      an old industrial plant, mixed with art and creativity. The perfect balance between work and
      play which we always aim for at the conference.

Nürnberg with a population of 500,000 is the nucleus of the metropolitan region Franconia at the heart of Europe. Located in southern Germany, it
      is midway between Munich and Frankfurt and therefor easily reachable by road, rail and air. As
      a tourist city, known for the Nuremberg Trials and famous for the Christmas Market, Nürnberg
      has a very good tourist office which will help you with all your needs. The office also
      provides an [accommodation portal](//tourismus.nuernberg.de/v06/no_cache/en/book-order/hotel-search-booking.html) on the web which should be your starting point to find a place
      to stay.

**Find more information about the location, how to get there and where
      to stay at[//conference.opensuse.org/location](//conference.opensuse.org/location)**

**So where do I sign up?**

Just register today in our [conference tool](//conference.opensuse.org/indico//confRegistrationFormDisplay.py?confId=2) and swing by the venue at the 11th. (...)

[The openSUSE
      Conference Program and Keynote Speakers](//news.opensuse.org/2011/08/19/osc-program-and-keynotes/)

With our [conference](//news.opensuse.org/2011/08/15/osc11/),
      osc11, fast approaching (Have you [registered](//conference.opensuse.org/register) yet? If not, what are you waiting for?!), the excitement is building all
      over the project.

Its quite some work to get to create a reasonable schedule for a conference. For osc we
      want to have a program with talks that interest all our visitors. And as visitors have a wide
      rage of skill levels we also want to balance the depth of the talks. Another thing we wanted
      to create are “gravitation centers” for our key topics
      within the program. Oh and we also seek out for new contributors with our conference. And all
      that needs to be sorted between rooms with different sizes, within the tracks you think are
      useful, with breaks, time to change rooms and so on and son on. Quite some parameters to take
      into account. That said, we are very happy that we can announce the schedule for the openSUSE
      Conference 2011 today!

[//conference.opensuse.org/timetable](//conference.opensuse.org/timetable)

We have scheduled more than 100 contributions in the four days of the conference. More
      than 50% of those are interactive like birds of a feather
        sessions (BoFs) and workshops, that is along
      with our motto RWXý which basically means that people should not only just listen, but also do
      things. (...)

[Klaas Freitag: openSUSE Conference 2011 Schedule Available](//lizards.opensuse.org/2011/08/17/opensuse-conference-2011-schedule-available/)

ts quite some work to get to a reasonable schedule for a FOSS conference done. You want a
      balanced program with topics where all visitors can find their interests in. Moreover the
      level of the talks must be taken care of as well as there should be gravitation centers for
      key topics within the community. As you usually also seek out for new community members with a
      conference, some topics which attract new people are also a very good idea. And all that needs
      to be sorted between rooms with different sizes, the times people can be around, the tracks
      you think are useful on the event and such. Quite some parameters to take into account. 

That said, I am very happy that we could issue the [schedule](//conference.opensuse.org/timetable) for the [openSUSE Conference 2011](//conference.opensuse.org) today.

For conference organization there is tooling. Or should I say: Should be? Given the huge
      amount of FOSS conferences around, the number of free alternatives of conference organization
      systems is fairly small. We decided to go again with [Indico](//indico-software.org/), a python based system developed by [CERN](//public.web.cern.ch/public/). It provides support for the whole
      conference life cycle such as the call for abstracts, the internal judging process, the
      scheduling and such. With nice help from the developers we got it running smoothly and
      integrated. Sometimes the interface is not really straightforward, but finally its a very
      feature rich yet flexible tool that feels like it has managed some large (CERN) conferences
      already.(...)

[Michal
        Hrušecký: openSUSE Conference 2011 – SaX3](//michal.hrusecky.net/2011/08/opensuse-conference-2011-sax3/)

Yet another advertisement for openSUSE Conference 2011. Something I’ll be participating in
      as well. But this time, all the glory belongs to [Manu Gupta](//news.opensuse.org/2011/07/05/people-of-opensuse-manu-gupta/).
      I’ll be just helping out. We will have together presentation about SaX3. Have you already
      heard about SaX3? If not,continue reading.

SaX2 was X configuration tool. It was using xorg.conf file and it allowed people to set
      various X properties in GUI. It was a user friendly way how to set up Xorg. But X developers
      made automatic configuration much better and xorg.conf file obsolete. They replaced it with
      something much better – configuration directory xorg.conf.d. You can place just snippets of
      original xorg.conf file in there to override some properties. It’s much better,
      butýunfortunatelyýit also made SaX2 obsolete. And even though automatic configuration is
      great, there still people that want to tweak just a few details. These people missed SaX2. One
      of the GSoC projects was to create SaX3 that will be aware of xorg.conf.d directory, respect
      it and would create just the necessary snippets. So your X configuration will stay as simple
      as possible, but you’ll also have possibility to configure it easily from GUI.

Manu started working on this project. He had to learn a lot of new things, but he put a
      lot of effort into that and in the end, there is completely new SaX3. It uses [libyui](//sourceforge.net/projects/libyui/)ýfor GUI toolkits abstraction.
      It is able to run as Qt, GTK or even ncurses application. It uses [Augeas](//augeas.net/) to parse xorg.conf.d files and during the summer
      even the Augeas Xorg lens was improved to support things that were needed. During the SaX3
      talk, you will learn, what SaX3 can do for you, how it works and also a little bit about
      interesting technologies beneath.

If you are eager to see, what it already can do, you can check [Manu’s blog about SaX3](//sysbytes.wordpress.com/tag/sax/) and especially
        [Get your
        hand dirty post](//sysbytes.wordpress.com/2011/07/08/sax3-get-your-hands-dirt/)

      [Alex Eftimie: PackageKit backend for Software Center: week 11 status report](//alex.eftimie.ro/2011/08/13/packagekit-backend-for-software-center-week-11-status-report/)
    

This week in three short achievements:

  * personal [OBS project](https://features.opensuse.org/312728)
            (playing around, tutored by DimStar), work in progress

  * code tide-up, [ready for merging](https://code.launchpad.net/~alexeftimie/software-center/packagekit-backend/+merge/71446) into master

  * features, usage and testing [documentation](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SoftwareCenter/PackagekitBackend),
            work in progress

I’m now focusing on the gtk3 part, and also documenting things around. Packaging has
      decreased priority, waiting for the pygobject release. And done.

For others, you can get it here [//download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/manugupt1/](//download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/manugupt1/).

From now on, I will focus a lot on fixing issues and polishing the UI, specially the

[N.B.Prashanth:
        libYUI Ported](//nbprashanth.wordpress.com/2011/08/18/libyui-ported/)

As most of you reading this post would know, separating libYUI was one of the topics for
      GSoC 2011 by openSUSE. Over the last three months, a lot of work has gone into the project. As
      the deadline approaches, we am happy to announce that libYUI is an independent
      framework!

Let me summarize the changes that have taken place over the last three months. For
      starters, libYUI is available over a range of platforms. Major platforms like Fedora, Ubuntu
      and Debian have ready made binaries available at OBS -[
        //download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/nbprashanth/](//download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/nbprashanth/). Recently, Michal
      Hrušecký even ported the library to Gentoo! – [michal.hrusecky.net/2011/08/libyui-in-gentoo/](//nbprashanth.wordpress.com/2011/08/18/libyui-ported/michal.hrusecky.net/2011/08/libyui-in-gentoo/). The source has been completely
      detached from SUSE-centric technologies. So if binaries are not available for your distro,
      don’t fret. You can always download the source and install from – [//sourceforge.net/projects/libyui/files/](//sourceforge.net/projects/libyui/files/).

        [Tejas Guruswamy: redshift and backintime in Factory](//masterpatricko.blogspot.com/2011/08/redshift-and-backintime-in-factory.html)
      

Well, it's been a long while since my last news ... but I've got some nice news to
        report - my submissions of redshift and backintime were accepted into openSUSE Factory. So
        these useful programs will be part of the next openSUSE release, hooray!

[Redshift](//jonls.dk/redshift/) is a little command-line (and
        GTK) utility which reduces screen brightness at night (via colour temperature, so your
        screen becomes more red). Given your location in the world, it automatically calculates
        sunset and sunrise and gradually ramps up/down the brightness at the right times. I find it
        makes working at night easier on the eyes, and wrote a little plasmoid to control it easily
        from the desktop, which I will also release when I get some time. For previous openSUSE
        versions one can download and install redshift from its OBS devel project, [X11:Utilities](//download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:/Utilities).

[Backintime](//backintime.le-web.org/) is a backup program,
        effectively a rsync frontend, with GUIs for KDE and GNOME. Once configured with which
        folders you want to back up, and where you want to back up to, it can automatically take
        backups based on a schedule. Also a very nice feature is that on filesystems that support it
        (not FAT), it uses hardlinks to the previous backup, so each backup is a full backup but
        only changed files take up space on the backup disk. Each backup is just a normal copy of
        all the folders, so no special software is needed for recovery, but backintime offers a GUI
        that allows you to easily navigate through all your backed up versions of a folder. IMO it's
        the best userfriendly but complete backup software for Linux desktops. backintime used to be
        packaged by packman and now lives on the OBS in [Archiving:Backup](//download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup/).

![](//3.bp.blogspot.com/-VuwTIKnMVSQ/TkZqVRBNHYI/AAAAAAAAAAg/uRLpcyZkU9U/s320/backintime.png)

Enjoy! If you have other interesting programs that aren't in openSUSE remember that
        anyone can contribute to Factory now, so if you are willing to maintain them, go ahead and
        submit them on the OBS! My next target is byobu, a set of preconfigured GNU screen profiles
        (I never figured out how to write hardstatus lines!)

        [Andreas Jaeger: Updating glibc to 2.14 with some libtirpc fun](//jaegerandi.blogspot.com/2011/08/updating-glibc-to-214-with-some.html)
      

The GNU C Library (glibc) version 2.14 was released on the 31th of May but we haven't
        switched to it for openSUSE yet since one of the major changes was the obsoletion of the
        sunrpc code in glibc and that caused problems. The TI-RPC library (libtirpc) is the proposed
        replacement of the sunrpc code. One benefit of the TI-RPC library is that it supports -
        unlike the old sunrpc code in glibc - IPv6. libtirpc is used successfully already by a
        couple of Open Source projects like autofs or nfs. Unfortunately some code in libtirpc seems
        to be broken, like the NIS support. The package missed also some header files to make it a
        full replacement but those can be easily copied over from glibc. So, building everything
        with libtirpc instead of glibc' sunrpc code was not possible, and the libtirpc developers
        seemed not to be interested in helping here. 

So, I've took now the same route that Fedora did and reenabled the sunrpc code in glibc
        again and thus everything works as before. I encourage everybody that has packages that work
        with libtirpc to switch to it - and help changing apps and libtirpc itself as needed so that
        eventually we really can obsolete glibc's sunrpc code. 

Today, the updated glibc has been submitted and checked into openSUSE's Factory
        distribution and thus will be in openSUSE 12.1. (...)

        management. 

For those of you who are not familiar with WebYaST. It is an easy-to-use, web-based
        configuration and administration tool. That means that you can configure hardware, network,
        services, security, and many more in a browser. 

Since we offer a one-click configuration for WebYaST [for a while](//blog.susestudio.com/2010/09/one-click-webyast.html) we
        decided to upgrade it to 1.2. If you want to add WebYaST 1.2 to your appliance, you just
        need to go to the configuration tab of and click on the appliance icon. Then scroll down to
        the 'Additional options' and check the 'Enable WebYaST' checkbox.

          [Sebastian Kügler: Installing Plasma Active on the ExoPC (“WeTab”)](//vizzzion.org/blog/2011/08/installing-plasma-active-on-the-exopc-wetab/)
        

If you own an ExoPC, and you’re eager to know how to get Plasma Active, our new
          workspace and set of applications for consumer devices to run on it, this blog article
          will help you get going. 

**Note:** Plasma Active is in alpha state right now, it
          is basically usable, but you will find many rough edges. You should not try this unless
          you consider yourself an early adopter, or if you mind fiddling with bits and pieces. We
          are working towards an end-user ready product, but we’re not yet there.

**What to pick?**

There are a few different options to choose from, I’ll quickly explain which to choose
          under which circumstances. 

  * **MeeGo:** Works well overall, but is lacking in
                key areas, for example we do not have a UI to connect to wireless networks yet, and
                as the device doesn’t have Ethernet (and cables are lame on mobile devices anyway).
                You can work around this with a [trick](//www.notmart.org/index.php/BlaBla/Wireless_on_Plasma_Active_MeeGo_) Marco explains. 

Choose this option if you want to run and develop for MeeGo

  * **Balsam Professional**: Download the Balsam
                Professional live images from [open-slx](//download.open-slx.com/iso/11.4/). This live image provides a fully functional live system without
                too much hassle. 

Choose this option if you want to try Plasma Active

  * **openSUSE**: Install Plasma Active on top of
                openSUSE 11.4, it uses the Active packages created by open-slx (me, my employer),
                but is a bit more laborious to install. 

Choose this option if you want to run the full experience on your ExoPC, or track progress and hack on Plasma Active

I will explain here how you can get to a state-of-the-art Plasma Active, using what
          will eventually become the Tablet Edition of Balsam Professional. Balsam Professional is,
          unlike openSUSE, focused on end-users and the user experience on consumer-level devices.
          Balsam Professional is based on openSUSE, so you might well be familiar with many of the
          tools already. (...)

[Sebastian
            Kügler: KDE:Active:Devel introduced](//vizzzion.org/blog/2011/08/kdeactivedevel-introduced/)

The past week, when working on the Mesa packages for [Plasma Active](//community.kde.org/Plasma/Active), I might have caused
          some headache since I broke the compositor in Plasma Active with a few packages I uploaded
          for easier deployment on test devices. It was not more than an annoyance, because kwin
          gracefully falls back to non-composited mode in case of graphics problems. In order to get
          a bit more stability into our deployment process, I’ve now set up a subproject called
            [KDE:Active:Devel](https://build.opensuse.org/project/monitor?project=KDE:Active:Devel) under the [KDE:Active](https://build.opensuse.org/project/monitor?project=KDE%3AActive)
          project on the Open Build Service (OBS) which we use to build the Balsam packages. As
          we’re moving, development-wise into the stabilization phase for Plasma Active One, this
          makes testing new things a lot easier, just by switching to the same package from the
          :Devel branch. Conversely, this means that if you install packages from the :Devel
          subproject, you should really know what you’re doing. On the bright side, it’ll be easier
          to keep regressions out of the packages that are deployed on most users’ machines. 

![](//vizzzion.org/images/blog/contour-alpha-news_thumb.png)

Along with these changes, I’ve updated all the packages to the latest state of the
          art, and worked a bit on our documentation, as we keep getting very good feedback about
          this. Among the most wanted fixes we’ve introduced is a patch by Aaron that makes konsole
          usable with the virtual keyboard, making another very powerful tool usable on Plasma
          Active. I’ve also fixed up some default configuration options, polished up the contour
          packages and made that used by default. (Those who have plasma-tablet-config on their
          machine will have to replace it with “plasma-contour-config”, though.) This is another
          pretty big move, as we now basically regard the contour shell stable enough to make it
          into Plasma Active One. It’s also very, very shiny I must say, the usual disclaimer about
          alpha software notwithstanding. 

OBS makes it rather convenient merging changes back and forth between these branches.
          In general, my impression is that OBS works very nicely as a collaboration tool, and
          solves a very complex problem for us, the “how do we get our code onto the device”. As an
          aside, it also makes it very easy to build packages locally, so for even shorter
          development-deployment cycles, one can build locally and rsync packages onto the device.
          With the right kind of script setup, that takes a lot of the pain away, that development
          for mobile devices often brings with it. The KDE:Active:Devel repo can be used directly by
          developers to upload their latest sources in order to deploy them to their testing
          machines, and we can pull working versions in from there. Rocking.

[Sebastian
            Kügler: Plasma Active on OpenGL ES](//vizzzion.org/blog/2011/08/plasma-active-on-opengl-es/)

The past weeks, I’ve been working on getting Kwin, the window manager and compositor
          in [Plasma Active](//community.kde.org/Plasma/Active) (and Plasma
          Desktop ;) to work on top of OpenGL ES instead of OpenGL. After some updating of packages
          lower in the stack, especially Mesa and parts of Xorg, we now have working OpenGL ES
          support on our hardware. Today, I’ve finished packaging it as an option on top of our
          Plasma Active packages. These packages in the :Devel subsection of the KDE:Active
          repository in the OBS run on top of Balsam Professional and openSUSE 11.4. We will give
          this some more testing and improve a few things, in order to move to GLES by default.
          OpenGL ES is very interesting as this is an API often used on mobile devices, so I’m glad
          that I can state that we’re ready for this. This of course needs proper support in the
          drivers, something we can not always solve by ourselves. I have been running this
          successfully on two Intel Atom-based tablets.

All the props of course to to our Akademy-award winning window management and
          compositing hero, the one and only Martin Grýsslin. He’s been working on OpenGL ES support
          (and a lot of other features to make kwin “ready for the future”) for quite some time
          already. OpenGL ES support in kwin has been introduced in the recent [Plasma Desktop 4.7](//kde.org/announcements/4.7/plasma.php) release, a
          few weeks ago.

![](//vizzzion.org/images/blog/contour-froscon_thumb.png)

So, is it much different? Nope, it’s very much a thing of underlying technology.
          There’s no noticable performance improvement, but it runs stable and well. Given that
          OpenGL ES support has only very recently been introduced in kwin, it’s already
          surprisingly good. There is probably still a lot of room for improvement, which is
          something we can investigate now and easily test much better.

**Froscon**

In the screenshot of the [Contour](//vizzzion.org/blog/2011/08/plasma-active-on-opengl-es/) shell
          of Plasma Active, you can see that I’m all set up to go to [FrOSCon](//vizzzion.org/blog/2011/08/plasma-active-on-opengl-es/)
          tomorrow, where I’ll be presenting the ideas and demoing the prototypes, hoping to get
          some feedback on concepts, and give some understanding of the challenges and opportunities
          we face in this exciting endeavour. And of course show some serious bling. :) If you’re in
          the area around Bonn, drop by.

Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn't
            going to go away. The code itself isn't well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It's only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don't have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

This is a reminder that the Testing Core Team will be holding our 3rd Open Bugs Day on
          Sunday August 21, 2011 from 0:00 to 23:59 UTC, The web page describing the event is [//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Open-Bugs-Day](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Open-Bugs-Day). 

To ensure that all the testers are using the same code base, we are making Virtual
          Machines available on our server. For those people that wish to test on their own
          hardware, there will be KDE and Gnome virtual images available at [//www5.zq1.de/img/](//www5.zq1.de/img/), and distribution
          snapshots available at [//mirror.zq1.de/opensuse/factory/iso/](//mirror.zq1.de/opensuse/factory/iso/). The virtual images have been
          prepared with KVM and tested with VirtualBox, and are compressed to a little over 900 MB.
          Instructions for using them in a VirtualBox VM are posted at [//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Open-Bugs-Day](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Open-Bugs-Day). 

The purpose of this OBD is to test the open bugs reported for oS 11.4 to see which of
          them are still affecting 12.1. As there are over 1300 open bugs for 11.4, we have a major
          job to do. If you have any time available on August 21, please join us. Use Channel
          #opensuse-testing on the Freenode IRC Network. irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-testing to
          get started. We hope you will join the effort to help eradicate bugs and make 12.1 be the
          best release ever. 

Our next IRC meeting will be at 17:00 UTC, September 12 on Channel #opensuse-testing
          on the Freenode IRC Network. irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-testing. We will discuss our

      [Greg Kroah-Hartman: Future of the -longterm kernel releases.](//www.kroah.com/log/linux/longterm-proposal-08-2011.html)
    

**tl;dr;**

  * -stable kernel releases stay the same

  * this proposal is how we pick the -longterm releases

  * -longterm kernels will be picked every year, and maintained for 2 years before being
            dropped.

  * the same Documentation/stablekernelrules.txt will
            apply for -longterm kernels, as before.

**History:**

2.6.16 became a "longterm" kernel because my day job (at SUSE) picked the 2.6.16 kernel
      for its "enterprise" release and it made things a lot easier for me to keep working at
      applying bugfixes and other stable patches to it to make my job simpler (applying a known-good
      bunch of patches in one stable update was easier than a set of smaller patches that were only
      tested by a smaller group of people.)

Seeing that this worked well, a cabal of developers got together at a few different Linux
      conferences and determined that based on their future distro release cycles, we could all aim
      for standardizing on the 2.6.32 kernel, saving us all time and energy in the long run. We
      turned around and planted the proper seeds within the different organizations and
      low-and-behold, project managers figured that this was their idea and sold it to the rest of
      the groups and made it happen. Right now all of the major "enterprise" and "stable" distro
      releases are based on the 2.6.32 kernel, making this trial a huge success.

Last year, two different community members (Andi and Paul) asked me if they could maintain
      the 2.6.34 and 2.6.35 kernels as -longterm kernel releases as their companies needed this type
      of support. I agreed, and they have done a great job at this.

Andi reports that the 2.6.35 kernel is being used by a number of different distros, but
      they will be phased out as their support lifetime expires. There are also a number of embedded
      users of the kernel as well as some individual ones. So that -longterm kernel is having a lot
      of benefit for a wide range of users.

Today:

Now that 2.6.32 is over a year and a half, and the enterprise distros are off doing their
      thing with their multi-year upgrade cycles, there's no real need from the distros for a new
      longterm kernel release. But it turns out that the distros are not the only user of the
      kernel, other groups and companies have been approaching me over the past year, asking how
      they could pick the next longterm kernel, or what the process is in determining this.

To keep this all out in the open, let's figure out what to do here. Consumer devices have
      a 1-2 year lifespan, and want and need the experience of the kernel community maintaining
      their "base" kernel for them. There is no real "enterprise" embedded distro out there from
      what I can see. montaVista and WindRiver have some offerings in this area, but they are not
      that widely used and are usually more "deep embedded". There's also talk that the CELF group
      and Linaro are wanting to do something on a "longterm" basis, and are fishing around for how
      to properly handle this with the community to share the workload. Android also is another huge
      player here, upgrading their kernel every major release, and they could use the support of a
      longterm kernel as well.

**Proposal:**

Here's a first cut at a proposal, let me know if you like it, hate it, would work for you
      and your company, or not at all:

  * a new -longterm kernel is picked every year.

  * a -longterm kernel is maintained for 2 years and then dropped.

  * -stable kernels keep the same schedule that they have been (dropping the last one
            after a new release happens.) These releases are best for products that require new
            hardware updates (desktop distros, community distros, fast-moving embedded distros (like
            Yocto)).

  * the normal -stable rules apply to these -longterm kernels as described in
              Documentation/stablekernelrules.txt

This means that there are 2 -longterm kernels being maintained at the same time, and one
      -stable kernel. I'm volunteering to do this work, as it's pretty much what I'm doing today
      anyway, and I have all of the scripts and workflow down.

**Public Notifications:**

The current kernel.org site doesn't properly show what is and is not being maintained as a
      -stable and -longterm kernel. I have a proposal for how to fix this involving 'git notes', I
      just need to sit down and do the work with the kernel.org admins to get this running
      properly.

**Thoughts?**

Feel free to comment on the [google+ thread](https://plus.google.com/111049168280159033135/posts/VyWdYvHnAS2)
      about this, or on the [lkml](https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/8/15/5)

      [Linus Torvalds: Linux 3.1-rc2](//article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1179341)
    

Hey, nice calm first week after the merge window. Good job. Or maybe
people are just being lazy, and everybody is on vacation. Whatever.
Don't tell me. I'm reasonably happy, I want to stay that way.

That said, I would be happy if it calmed down further. 300+ commits
for -rc2 is good, but please make me even happier for -rc3 by ONLY
sending me real fixes. Think of it as "fairly late in the -rc series",
because I really want to compensate for the merge window being fairly

**Among the most important advancements of Linux 3.1 are improvements for all major Wi-Fi drivers and virtualisation optimisations. **

One week after [issuing](//www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-First-release-candidate-for-Linux-3-1-1319559.html) Linux 3.1-rc1, Linus Torvalds[ presented](//thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1179341) the second
      release candidate of Linux 3.1 late on Sunday night. The new version has been taken as an
      opportunity to [rename](//git.kernel.org/linus/93ee7a9340d64f20295aacc3fb6a22b759323280)
      the kernel, which had been christened "Sneaky Weasel" [at the end of May](//www.h-online.com/news/item/First-release-candidate-of-Linux-3-0-available-1252280.html); its new name is "Wet Seal". Torvalds didn't provide any
      background reasons for his choice of name – it could be to do with the diving course he [attended](https://plus.google.com/102150693225130002912/posts/RLmbspKyr68) as a
        [divemaster](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divemaster).

In his release email for the second release candidate, Torvalds was pleased to report that
      the merge window had been "pretty normal". From now until the final release of Linux 3.1, only
      corrections and minor improvements that don't present any risk – apart from rare exceptions –
      will now be accepted into the Linux main development branch.

        [MakeUseOf/Danny Stieben: Manage Your Twitter & Identi.ca Accounts With Choqok](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/manage-twitter-identica-accounts-choqok-linux/)
      

For people who are really tweet-o-holics, constant access to [Twitter](//www.makeuseof.com/tags/twitter) (or [Identi.ca](//www.identi.ca), an open source clone of Twitter) is as much
        a necessity as food and water. At varying levels, this may also be true for those who are
        fans of Twitter but not necessarily tweet-o-holics.

One possible choice is to have Twitter up and running in the browser most of the time.
        While this is a feasible solution, you’ll start missing out when the browser is minimized.
        Also, a browser isn’t exactly lightweight on system resources. Therefore, your best bet
        would be to use a well-built Twitter desktop client.

**About Chokoq**

[Choqok](//choqok.gnufolks.org) is a slim Twitter and Identi.ca
        client made to integrate well with the [KDE](//www.makeuseof.com/tags/kde) desktop environment. As far as social media clients go, [Gwibber](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/gwibber-the-everything-client/) may be a
        more well known piece of software, but it’s best suited to run under a [GNOME](//www.makeuseof.com/tags/gnome) desktop. You’re always welcome to
        try Gwibber with KDE, but I’ve always preferred software native to the desktop environment
        you’re using. With Choqok, you can quickly and easily reach your Twitter stream at any time
        and get notifications that appear right on your desktop. (...)

But uptake in corporate environments has never been its strong suit, largely because it does not include groupware features such as event invitations and shared address books.

During [Desktop Summit](https://www.desktopsummit.org/welcome-second-desktop-summit) in Berlin some people asked me how to make wireless sharing work. Connection sharing allows to use a computer as gateway for other computers, NM does that by routing all IP packages from one network interface to the default route of your computer (yes, that is a Masquerate configuration). For example, you can configure your notebook to access Internet through ethernet cable and create a wifi shared connection to allow other computers to access Internet using your notebook's default route. Your notebook will act like an access point. (...)

Sometimes, you run into a problem that you just can’t work through with mental brute

One popular and effective way of beating a problem or releasing your creativity is

Nowadays, few enterprise websites run without [PHP](//olex.openlogic.com/packages/php), the dynamic scripting language that serves as the “P” in the [LAMP](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29) stack. Coding PHP applications is relatively easy thanks to the abundance of high-quality PHP frameworks available. Here’s a high-level overview of several of these open source frameworks, noting their scalability, maturity, licenses, and commercial support. While they may differ in many ways, they have one thing in common: they cost nothing to try and to use.

PHP frameworks not only make web development fast and easy but also standardize and streamline the whole development process. They are much more than just snippets of code or libraries you can reuse. They guide you through the whole development process, from laying out file structures to building data connectors and performing unit tests. All of these popular frameworks are object-oriented and follow the Model-View-Controller ([MVC](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)) design philosophy. (...)

Of late, I have been reading a lot of code via browser. Sometimes, when evaluating a

If I am using VIM, I can happily use CTAGS for this. Chrome highlights all the

        another string, the old highlights disappear. It would have been nicer if any new string

Samba can function as a domain controller, but you need to set several Samba options for it to do so. (...)

[Danny Kukawka: How to get your full disc space back on ext filesystems](//dkukawka.blogspot.com/2011/08/how-to-get-your-full-disc-space-back-on.html)

You may have already wondered why you can't use the full disc space on an ext2/3/4
        partition? You already seen something like this, where the used and available blocks don't
        fit the number of blocks on the
        device/partition:

Filesystem                 1K-blocks   Used    Available Use%
Mounted on /dev/sdc1       15391664    38184   14571608  1%
/mnt

The reason is: if you create an ext filesystem (no matter if with mkfs or YaST), 5 % of
        the filesystem get reserved for the super-user to allow e.g. root daemons to continue to
        write to the partition after unprivileged processes stopped because the partition is
        full.While this perfectly make sense on system partitions as '/', it makes no sense on data
        partitions or external media (in the most cases). By this you get e.g. on an external
        2TB/1.8TiB drive 100GByte/~92GiB, which you can't use as normal user. But you can get this
        space back. Either you set the number of reserved blocks to zero when you create the file

[Nelson Marques: A
        brief update on things…](//www.marques.so/2011/08/a-brief-update-on-things/)

I’ve been a bit away from openSUSE in the last months (mainly this summer) and this is
      related to several things that are happening in my personal life. During this time I’ve kept a
      look in several packages I maintain for GNOME, but haven’t been doing anything related to
      openSUSE.

As many people know, the international pressures in Portugal are placing much demanding
      things on every citizen, mainly on the working force. I still don’t see the shackles around my
      hands, but it’s pretty much obvious they exist and they are around my wrists. It’s time to
      rethink the strategy for the life I wanted to live and move out to living it.

No changes to be announced except that some weight I shouldered is going to be dropped,
      this is the case of GNOME:Ayatana, which I will discuss with Vincent once he’s around, but
      from my side the proposal is simple, salvage all the packages that are requirements to other
      packages and might have some utility in the distro, all the others, just a plain and simple
      nuke them. It served it’s purposes, but I no longer have the time or will to continue
      maintaining stuff, some that worked, others that never worked. In a way I was wrong, openSUSE
      users are far better with the traditional choices, ex: GNOME, than with other alternative
      choices.

      [Sebastian Kügler: Release Team Changes](//vizzzion.org/blog/2011/08/release-team-changes/)
    

**Release Team Changes**

During the Desktop Summit in Berlin, we had a session in which we had a good look at
      how KDE’s release team performs, which points we can improve on, how, and who will
      implement these changes. For example: 

  * Make our output more predictable and thus downstreams’ lives easier

  * Reduce the risk of something going wrong, the [bus number problem](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_number)

  * Make our work more efficient

Let’s take a step back first, though.

**A bit of history: from Coolo & Dirk to TWG to Release Team**

In KDE 3, Coolo and Dirk managed KDE’s releases. When KDE4 was started, we also wanted
      to promote this in a more suitable fashion, we started doing more proactive PR work, and
      generally improved our communication to our users (potential or not). In 2005, the
      Technical Working Group was conceived, which was meant to handle the releases of KDE4. The
      Technical Working Group didn’t quite work out since it didn’t bring the structural changes
      we needed in order to release KDE4. In late 2006 we we decided that it didn’t work,
      disbanded the TWG and conceived the release team, a self-organized team of volunteers.
      Conceptually, the release team started as a place for people to go who wanted to make
      releases happen. We found module maintainers for our released modules who would coordinate
      towards the app teams and, and a few core people who know how all that stuff works to put
      things together. We got our release process on the rails again. Interestingly, the release
      team is very informal, we never ended up appointing anyone release manager, or
      end-responsible — it has also never been necessary, it seems. Lesson here: shared
      responsibility works well for us.

A quick unscientific count of the whole KDE 4 series (including pre-releases) brought
      me to 88 releases done by the release team in its current form.

The Linux kernel development process may be getting a little tweaking if a proposal by -stable kernel maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman is accepted; tweaking needed to meet growing commercial interest in Linux.

The proposal is simple, on the surface and all the way down: Currently, the 2.6.32 kernel is maintained as a -longterm kernel, a kernel release that is maintained as a stable release with bug fixes and patches for a relatively lengthy period of time. This is opposed to the official -stable release of the Linux kernel, which is the kernel release most suitable for general use, and is dropped when the next release is moved into the -stable category. (The current -stable release, for example, is the 3.0.1 kernel.) (...)
