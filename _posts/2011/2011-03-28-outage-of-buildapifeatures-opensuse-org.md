![](//en.opensuse.org/images/4/43/Failgeeko.png)We are currently facing problems with the the following openSUSE services:

[//build.opensuse.org](//build.opensuse.org/)
[//api.opensuse.org](//api.opensuse.org/)
[ //features.opensuse.org](//features.opensuse.org)

[ ](//features.opensuse.org)We are trying to resolve this as fast as possible. Apologies for inconveniences this may cause.

Please contact admin@opensuse.org with any queries.

**Update 2011-03-28 10:30 UTC:** Everything is working again.

**Update 2011-03-28 13:44 UTC**: The login system is a bit unstable at the moment and might be occasionally unavailable for a few minutes again, they will be back soon. We're working on getting everything running smoothly again.
