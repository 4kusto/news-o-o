Hello Mates! openSUSE Medical here!

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Opensuse_medical_logo11.png)](//news.opensuse.org/2011/06/09/new-leadership-inside-the-medical-project/opensuse_medical_logo11/)

Well i would to announce that “openSUSE Medical Calling and also needs you”

a) Due to lack of time (i’ve began my Master Studies abroad) i’ve to give up from the project. I think that there are people who are able to lead the project and have more time available.

So “Looking for openSUSE Medical Next Leader”

b) I have created two pages (according to the last meeting’s goals) :

i) “Section Page” : [//en.opensuse.org/Portal:Medical/section.html](//en.opensuse.org/Portal:Medical/section.html)
ii) “Participate Page” : [//en.opensuse.org/Portal:Medical/participate.html](//en.opensuse.org/Portal:Medical/participate.html)

The process is you have a look at the Sections and then you declare your participation in the “Participate Page” (according to the instructions given in the pages).

So the project needs you for:

a) “The Next Project Leader”

b) “Participants for the Sections”

Anyone interested in (a) or (b) can reply to this e-mail or can post an e- mail to the [opensuse-medical@opensuse.org](mailto:opensuse-medical@opensuse.org)
