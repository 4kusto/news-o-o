      [Volunteers
        needed for the conference](//news.opensuse.org/2011/08/01/volunteers-needed-conference/)
    

As you know, the third international [openSUSE
        Conference](//conference.opensuse.org/) is happening in a couple of weeks from now, you already should be [registered](//conference.opensuse.org/indico//confRegistrationFormDisplay.py/display?confId=2)! For the organization team this means that we are really picking up pace
      now and start to feel dizzy. One of the reasons for that is that we are short on helping
      hands. We especially miss “boots on the ground“, **we need your help!**

Being a boot on the ground means we need people to help us at the conference in September.
      There is no special knowledge about the location or other details needed. So far we have 5
      tasks where we desperately need people to help out. Venue setup, Registration Desk, Session
      Chairs and the Snack Bar. Read on to learn how you can contribute to the success of the
      conference.

**[Venue
          Setup](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_volunteers#Venue_Setup)**

The Zentrifuge is not an event location in the classical sense so we have to do a lot of
      setup tasks the days before the conference starts. For instance we need to make sure that the
      seminar rooms have enough chairs, multisockets and a working projector. We also need to setup
      the lounge with sofas, equip the Beergarden with tables, distribute waste bins and so on and
      so on. Most of this we will need to do on Friday/Saturday before the conference and it’s a lot
      of physical labor. If you can help with this please lets us know on the volunteers page or let
      us know at opensuse-conference@opensuse.org.

**[The Registration Desk]()**

At the conference, every morning from 9:00 to 10:30, we will have a registration desk. It
      will handle the registration of new visitors,  distribution of info materials and answering of
      general questions and such. We need two people per day to man this desk during the conference.
      On Sunday, as it’s the first day, it better be three! If you can help with this please lets us
      know on the volunteers page or let us know at opensuse-conference@opensuse.org.

**[Session
          Chair](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_volunteers#Session_Chair)**

We have two floors in the Zentrifuge and both have a main room and some smaller rooms for
      workshops and birds of a feather sessions. For both floors we need two people per day to be a
      chair for the sessions that will take place. Being a chair means that you introduce the next
      presenter, make sure the sessions stick to the schedule and answer all questions speakers
      might have. This task takes a bit of experience as speaker/moderator to make the
      introductions, a wristwatch and, ideally, some technical knowledge with projectors/laptops. If
      you can help with this please lets us know on the volunteers page or drop us a mail
      at opensuse-conference@opensuse.org.

**[The Snack
        Bar](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_volunteers#The_Bar)**

This year we will run our own snack bar at the venue. The organization team has already
      seen to that foods and drinks are available and that we have a fully equipped snack bar
      ready.  Now we need people that help us to man the snack bar to sell, sell, sell. You would
      need to sell snacks and drinks, make sure that we don’t run out and count the moneys! If you
      can help with this please lets us know on the volunteers page or drop us a mail
      atopensuse-conference@opensuse.org.

[**Evening Manager and Lock Service**](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_volunteers#Evening_Manager_and_Lock_Service)

One nice side effect of the Zentrifuge not being a classical event location is that we
      will have very long opening hours. People can continue to collaborate and don’t have to leave
      the place until 23:00. But this also means that we have to have at least one person per day
      that makes sure it doesn’t get to wild and that closes everything in the night. If you can
      help with this please lets us know on the volunteers page or drop us a mail
      at opensuse-conference@opensuse.org.

**Other tasks**

The team held couple of meetings which resulted in a nice list of stuff to do, like
      organizing hardware for the venue, ordering internet, food and drinks and so on. If you rather
      want to help with this, you’re more than welcome to contribute to the conferences success! A
      good start is to subscribe to our mailing list and participate in our meetings.

**Thanks a lot in advance!**

[Are you ready for RWX³
        ?](//news.opensuse.org/2011/08/01/are-you-ready/)

Less than 50 days left before the [3rd openSUSE conference](//en.opensuse.org/Portal:Conference) starts. A lot of people are working hard for this to be
      another successful gathering. Are you [registered](//conference.opensuse.org/indico//confRegistrationFormDisplay.py/display?confId=2) yet? If you are still undecided, and looking for a reason why you should
      come, let me tell you this:

  * You will miss many interesting talks, you’ve heard the little birds sing that kernel
            star Greg KH will keynote at oSC…

  * More awesome keynote speakers and sessions are going to be announced in the next
            week or so, STAY TUNED!

  * You will miss one of the greatest FOSS events in the world.

  * You will miss a chance to meet other fellow Lizards from all over the world in
            person.

  * You will miss the chance to meet people from other projects like [KDE](//www.kde.org/), [GNOME](//www.gnome.org/) and [LibreOffice](//www.libreoffice.org/).

  * Imagine the interesting talks you will have in the halls of the conference, if you
            won’t come you will miss those too.

  * You will miss to visit Nuremberg, one of the most beautiful and historical cities on
            Europe.

  * You will miss tons of group-hugs.

  * You will lose the chance to kick people that annoy you on IRC and on Mailing
            lists.

  * You will miss the chance of drinking lots of openSUSE-branded beers and eating tons
            of Wurst having a good excuse, you will be in Germany after all so it’s your ‘duty’ to
            do that.

If you want to come, but money is a problem then you can apply for assistance through
        the [Conference travel sponsorship program](//news.opensuse.org/2011/08/01/2011/07/23/travel-sponsorship-program/). People of openSUSE ‘are willing to help you,
      as much as possible.

The conference will take place in [Zentrifuge](//www.zentrifuge-nuernberg.de/) which is a very interesting place to be. [Zentrifuge](//www.zentrifuge-nuernberg.de/) has an exhibition and event
      hall on the former grounds of a company called AEG. The hall is used to host art exhibitions
      of local and international artists and workshops. It is managed by a foundation that helps
      network the art world. The people there are very excited about the idea of hosting our
      conference so you can count on having a great time there during the conference.

Oliver Fecher visited Zentrifuge Venue and took a few shoots of the place that will host
      the Conference. Take a closer look at the photos and imagine you and your favorite FOSS people
      having endless talks there.

      [Justine Leng: Implement sorting functions for Requests](//obsforandroid.wordpress.com/2011/08/01/implement-sorting-functions-for-requests/)
    

One of the goals for this OBS Mobile Project to make the list of requests sortable, by
      date/time, requester, target project/package, and request state.(...)

”

      [Justine Leng: New Features Added to Requests](//obsforandroid.wordpress.com/2011/08/05/new-features-added-to-requests/)
    

I would like to share some exciting progress on the OBS Mobile Project:

  1. Request state has been added to each request;

  2. Sorting functions have been implemented for Requests;

  3. A search filter has been added to the Request page.

Now, when the user logs into the list of requests, the user will not only be able to see
      the state of each request, but also sort requests based on 4 criteria:

  * request date

  * requester’s name

  * target project/package

  * request state

[David Williams: Entomologist UI Changes – Weekly report #11](//redache.wordpress.com/2011/08/06/entomologist-ui-changes-weekly-report-11/)

This week has involved trying to get the UI in place for ToDo List
      exporting/configuration. The work should now be finished and I’ve begun trying to implement
      Remember the Milk exporting which is made a bit complicated by how they accept API requests
      but I hope to have this finished as soon as possible. I don’t really have that much to talk
      about this week as nothing huge has changed but I will keep working on integrating the
      services.

What I hope to achieve is Google Calendar, Remember The Milk and WebDAV server integration
      by the Soft Pencils Down Date, which I believe is the 19th of August. I think it’s perfectly
      achievable to get these features to a finished state by then and I’ll continue working on
      having them integrated. As I’ve previously mentioned I would like to use the final week as a
      time to merge and test everything to try and uncover any bugs I’ve missed whilst adding these
      features.

        [Michal Marek: Mounting /usr in the initrd](//lizards.opensuse.org/2011/08/03/mounting-usr-in-the-initrd/)
      

I changed the openSUSE mkinitrd to mount the /usr filesystem in the initrd, if /usr is a
        separate partition. I hope this will calm down some heated discussions about systemd, udev,
        etc. It’s not 100% ready yet, some setups like root or /usr on nfs or md might not work as
        expected (*), but the common usecases should be covered. Try updating mkinitrd from
          the [Base:System project](//download.opensuse.org/repositories/Base:/System/openSUSE_Factory/) and let me know if it works for you. Before testing it, you
        should do a backup of your initrd:


        

# cp /boot/initrd-`uname -r`{,.orig}


      

and create a section in /boot/grub/menu.lst pointing to the /boot/initrd-*.orig
        file.

        [Andreas Jaeger: Factory Progress 2011-08-05](//lizards.opensuse.org/2011/08/05/factory-progress-2011-08-05/)
      

The last few weeks have seen some a lot of package updates thus keeping our review and
        checkin team busy. I’d like to mention Sascha Peilicke who reviewed alone this week lots of
        packages. Have a look at just two numbers: In all of July we had 1001 check-ins and just
        from August 1st to 4th we had already 276 checkins.

The legal team has also gone through the long list of new packages and package updates
        during the legal reviews and reduced this week the list from over 100 packages to 12
        packages now. Thanks Ciaran and Christoper for your legal review!

**Policy**

**Detailed changes**

Coolo [explained](//lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-packaging/2011-07/msg00096.html) the current policy on how detailed the changes entry in packages should be:

“

I repeat what I said before so everyone is on the same page:

Version numbers are per se no information and we want to offer users an easy,
            standarized way to find out what changed. But it’s not the packager’s job to collect
            upstream NEWS. So if the upstream project does not offer a summary, then say so in the
            .changes file, so also the user knows. If the upstream  project does not provide a
            summary but a detailed web page, then a link is fine too.

”

**Major Package checkins**

**Desktops**

GNOME saw another step to the stable GNOME 3.2.0 with the GNOME 3.1.4 testing release
        getting pushed into Factory. KDE’s new release 4.7 is now also in Factory.

So far, the new kontact 2.0 version has not been submitted for Factory and you can get
        it from the KDE repositories. Btw. the openSUSE KDE developers have made the sqlite backend
        the default for akonadi since the upstream default of mysql caused too many problems. If
        you’re running already kmail2 and like to switch follow[Ismail’s advice](//lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-kde/2011-07/msg00268.html) to change in ~/.config/akonadi/akonadiserverrc the line Driver=QMYSQL to
        Driver=QSQLITE.

**New packages**

New packages include quassel (an irc client) clementine (an amarok competitor) shorewall
        (new firewall). Also amarok was updated to 2.4.3 and thunderbird got updated together with
        enigmail.

**Mounting /usr in the initrd**

[Michal Marek](//lizards.opensuse.org/2011/08/03/mounting-usr-in-the-initrd/) updated mkinitrd to mount /usr in the initrd. In the past, we had to move
        quite a lot libraries and binaries from /usr to the rootpartition to allow having /usr as
        separate partition that can be mounted in all supported scenarios, like via nfs. This led to
        changes in many places and testing that everything worked as well. With mounting from the
        initrd, we do not need to move binaries and libraries anymore around.

Michal calls for testers on his [blog](//lizards.opensuse.org/2011/08/03/mounting-usr-in-the-initrd/) and
        is also going to enhance the initrd to support all cases. Right now the simple cases work
        but support for booting from nfs is not supported yet.

**Other interesting bits**

**openSUSE Conference**

Please register now for the conference!

I wanted to open a fate feature about this when I first heard of plymouth, but
            reading
            //fedoramagazine.wordpress.com/2008/10/21/interview-fedora-10s-better-startup/
            really makes me think we should go this way.

Ray's comment starting with "Every flicker and mode change in the boot
            process takes away from the whole experience." is especially interesting. Is it
            okay to track the "don't show grub by default" here?

An easy way to remove Software! For example: you installed an application with "1-click install" (which will install all the packages that you need), there should be an easy way (also with 1 click) to remove what you have installed with that 1-click operation... in another words: an "1-click Uninstall" to remove installed software (dependencies and packages included).

            [Update to GRUB v2 (Score: 143)](https://features.opensuse.org/308497)
          

Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn't
            going to go away. The code itself isn't well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It's only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don't have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

        [Jos Poortvliet: KDE release on Radio Antwerp](//blog.jospoortvliet.com/2011/07/kde-release-on-radio-antwerp.html)
      

As usual lots going on. I haven't mentioned it anywhere yet, so: congrats to all [KDE peeps](//kde.org/) for the[release of SC 4.7](//www.kde.org/announcements/4.7/) ;-)

I presented the release on [Radio Antwerp Centraal](//webgang.radiocentraal.be/?p=2887) a few days ago. I had helped out a bit with the release
        announcement but hadn't had a recent look so I had to catch up to the major highlights
        quickly. Worked out great, though. Also discussed [Tumbleweed](//opensuse.org/tumbleweed) and GNOME with the radio dude. Not
        sure what the initial plan was but I found myself talk for a full program in the end...
        Surprise, huh?

On the other side of the world I went to CLS last week. Still have to turn my notes into
        something readable - struggling with crappy sleep, family visits and other time-eating
        things. And the DS is upcoming... But I'll blog about this later, promise!

[Jos
          Poortvlieet: And they keep rocking…](//news.opensuse.org/2011/08/04/and-they-keep-rocking%E2%80%A6/)

Over the last few months the openSUSE ambassadors have continued to visit conferences
      around the world. Since our [previous report](//news.opensuse.org/2011/05/06/opensuse-ambassadors-are-rocking-all-over-the-world/) beginning of May, several big events have happened and we’ll treat
      you on a report on some of those.

**Already covered in blogs**

Let’s start with a few quick links to reports which are already online and probably read
      by some of you. There is for example the huge splash Greece ambassadors made at [Fosscomm 2011](//news.opensuse.org/2011/05/27/fosscomm-2011/) which took
      place on May 7 and 8 in Greece. With 8 presentations as well as a similar number of lightning
      talks and a workshop on OBS openSUSE ruled the conference. The team co-hosted the GNOME
      community in their booth as well as the Enlightenment project and a few others, showing the
      open and collaborative spirit of openSUSE! Last but not least, they organized a late 11.4
      release party which ended up having Red Hat, Ubuntu, Slackware, FreeBSD and many other
      visitors joining the party!

The Greek team also organized a [summer
      camp](//news.opensuse.org/2011/06/20/opensuse-summer-camp-greece-2011/) from which you can see pictures in their [facebook group](//www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=153638841330360). Rest
      assured we’ll make them work harder after they so clearly spend a lot of time drinking and
      hanging in the sun…

Most interestingly, the Greek team went to [the Xariseto.gr bazaar](//zoumpis.wordpress.com/2011/05/20/participation-of-opensuse-greek-community-in-xariseto-gr-bazaar-may-14-2011-report/). In Thanasis’ words: Xariseto is a festival where people
      meet and donate their personal belongings which they don’t use any more. So as a Linux and
      openSUSE community we thought that participating in these kind of festivals is really
      interesting.

The result was people from 7 to 70 years old learning about openSUSE… The team also went
      to the [EL/LAK conference in Thessaloniki](//opensuseambassadors.blogspot.com/2011/06/report-from-ellak-conference.html).

And as was quite visible on [planet
      openSUSE](//planet.opensuse.org/), we [had](//michal.hrusecky.net/2011/05/linuxtag-2011/) [a
          presence](//lizards.opensuse.org/2011/05/16/wine-on-linuxtag-2011/) [at](//mvidner.blogspot.com/2011/05/linuxtag-2011-pictures.html) [LinuxTag](//blog.jospoortvliet.com/2011/05/linuxtag-2011.html) [in](//www.digitalflow.de/blog/2011/05/linuxtag-2011-in-berlin/) [Berlin](//lizards.opensuse.org/2011/05/16/opensuse-on-the-linuxtag-2011/).

**More reports**

While not all openSUSE ambassadors have the time to send in event reports, we are always
      happy to read the ones we get. Below a few of them.

**Chile, FLISoL**

At the end of April, Ricardo Varas Santana attended the FLISoL event in Chile, which has
      about 1000 visitors. He gave a talk titled “openSUSE, Linux in Green
        and for all”, talking about what openSUSE is, how to get involved as well as what
      technologies we have. About 400 DVD’s were handed out as well!

**USA**

Orv Beach participated in the Southwest Computer Conference where he presented openSUSE to
      an eager crowd. He gave out Tuxes and Geeko’s as well as 160 DVD’s and flyers to the visitors,
      mostly members from Computer Clubs around the USA.

**Taiwan**

Max “Sakana” from Taiwan wrote us three reports in one. First of all, he as well as
      several other openSUSE ambassadors was at GNOME.Asia 2011, where the GNOME 3 LiveDVD’s (based
      on openSUSE) were handed out. Pictures can be found in the[openSUSE flickr pool](//www.flickr.com/groups/opensuse/pool/page2/). But
      Max and the Taiwan team did more. Max teaches students openSUSE at the [Ming Chi University of
        Technology](//english.mcut.edu.tw/onweb.jsp?webno=3333333330), where openSUSE is quite popular. Moreover, there were two seminars at
      two different colleges, the [Ling Tung
        University](//webov.ltu.edu.tw/Eng_Ltu/) and the [National Formosa
          University](//www.nfu.edu.tw/main.php) about [SUSE Studio](//susestudio.com/) and Nagios
      with openSUSE. openSUSE DVD’s were handed out and according to Max, openSUSE did very
      well!

**Great Britain**

Stuart Tanner went to the RedRat Computer Market in Sheffield. He was the only linux
      person in the room and brought a large 42″ FullHD TV to demo it. He tried to lure
      amateur-photographers into Free Software, aweing them with ShowFoto, DigiKam and similar
      tools

**Netherlands**

Your humble writer has also done his small share the last months, showing up at a computer
      event in the Netherlands. A team of 4 manned a booth, held 2 presentations, handed out a few
      hundred DVD’s as well as posters and in general showed openSUSE rocks also in NL!

**more work**

First of all, the above are just a few of the events we know about. For example, in
      Brazil, openSUSE was present on FISL, the Porto Alegre event with over 8000 visitors. We’re
      eagerly awaiting the event report! More events happened, more will come. But this is not the
      only thing openSUSE ambassadors do!

Take the incredible Baltasar Ortega who has been covering openSUSE and KDE
      technology [in his blog](//kdeblog.com/) for years! If you can read
      Spanish, be sure to bookmark his blog. He will point you to[gems like the
        Studio Imagewriter](//www.kdeblog.com/como-grabar-tu-live-usb-con-imagewriter.html) or share [wonderful tutorials like these](//www.kdeblog.com/kde-tutorials-7-y-8-cambiando-las-fuentes-y-uso-basico-de-dolphin.html). Max wrote an article about “openSUSE and Hadoop” the May edition of the Hongkong Chinese/Taiwanese [Linux Pilot Magazine](//www.linuxpilot.com/issue/102).

And did you notice our Greek team [translates the awesome Weekly News in Greece](//opensuseambassadors.blogspot.com/2011/07/greek-opensuse-community-translation-of_15.html)?

**Value**

The work these ambassadors do for openSUSE is incredibly valuable and should not be under
      estimated. Christos Bountalis, working on [fillup-ng](//cbounta.wordpress.com/2011/05/07/gsoc-2011tool-for-merging-configuration-files/) in openSUSE, joined after meeting the Greek openSUSE ambassadors at an
      event, remarking [in his
        interview](//news.opensuse.org/2011/06/23/people-of-opensuse-christos-bountalis/), when asked why he joined openSUSE: I have found many nice and interesting
      peopleAnd indeed. People are what makes the difference between a good and a great Free
      Software project. And our Ambassadors are often the first people outsiders see!

**Thanks!**

So we’d like to thank our ambassadors for their awesome work, and invite anyone to [join their ranks](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Ambassadors)!

You can also help in other ways. For example, if you are an openSUSE developer or follow
      development closely, add a glimpse of what is coming to the wiki. Or if you know a bit about
      openSUSE, add and improve our talking points! We also can always use artwork, help with
      writing and many other things. Feel free to contact the openSUSE marketing team
      on opensuse-marketing@opensuse.org and offer to help out!

        [1st Greek openSUSE Collaboration Summer weekend Camp: The Report](//news.opensuse.org/2011/08/03/1st-greek-opensuse-collaboration-camp-the-report/)
      

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-NutxrTT91yI/TisKo8JflCI/AAAAAAAACcU/MkSGIlo3ghs/s800/DSCN1516.JPG)

From Friday the 15th to Sunday the 17th of July Lizards and other FOSS enthusiasts were
        gathered at Katerini for the 1st Greek openSUSE Collaboration Summer weekend Camp.

The whole event started at the Hotel pool where all met before the actual beginning of the
        event . After everybody that was expected came, the talks started.

Fridays talks were more related to the openSUSE local community. [Efstathios Iosifidis](//stathisuse.blogspot.com/) and [Kostas Koudaras](//e-tote-kala.blogspot.com/)presented [Lokalize](//userbase.kde.org/Lokalize) and [gtranslator](//projects.gnome.org/gtranslator/) and show people how useful
        tool those are. Efstathios Agrapidis along with[Stella Rouzi](//en-gb.facebook.com/differentreality) presented how you can
        help the community by translating the openSUSE weekly news.

After a dinner break from 19:30 to 20:30 there was a Translation contest. The original
        plans were on letting people translating some wiki articles in a certain time but since people
        were enthusiast about [Lokalize](//userbase.kde.org/Lokalize) and[gtranslator](//projects.gnome.org/gtranslator/) the program Committee 
        decided to change it and give people .po files to translate. The contest should normally last
        one and a half hour total but everybody asked for more time to do more work, so   [Diomidis Anadiotis](//anadiotisd.wordpress.com/) talk ‘I am new to the
        community’ was postponed and the contest lasted until midnight. During the contest 20
        applications were translated from English to Greece.

The program was made lose so that people had the opportunity to physically collaborate, it
        was considered more important for the people to have fun working as a community than actually
        have a tight schedule and this actually worked perfect through the weekend. After all the hard
        work of the first day, people wore their bathing-suits and went to the Hotel’s pool party
        where they had tons of fun. People there had  beers, conversations about FOSS, late night pool
        games. The last of them actually left the party after 4:00. Once again it was proven that FOSS
        is tightly connected with fun.

At Saturday there was an early wake around 8:30 for breakfast and around 10:15 the program
        started with the announcement of the previous night’s contest where [Diomidis Anadiotis](//anadiotisd.wordpress.com/) won the Geeko plush
        reward. The First presentation of the day was ‘Using Yast – System management: easy, fast and
        with many options’ where Efstatios Agrapidis and [Kostas Koudaras](//e-tote-kala.blogspot.com/) presented how and why to use YaST more.    The day continued
        with [Theo Chatzimichos](//blogs.gentoo.org/tampakrap/)from
        the [Gentoo](//www.gentoo.org/) community presenting Django and
        making a tutorial of how and why to use it. After that[Stavros Kalapothas](//www.itsystem.gr/) and [Efstathios Hatzikiriakidis](//efxa.org/) from[The-Hackerspace](//the-hackerspace.org/) presented ‘Security and arduino: Multifactor authentication system
        (voice recognition and RFID technologies)’ which was a four hour workshop with a short
        break.

After the workshop, at around 15:00 there was  long break where once again there were
        great  FOSS conversations among cold beer, water-gun fights, pool volley and other water
        sports… Some people though preferred to take a nap since last nights sleep was not enough for
        them.

At around 17:30 the program started again with ‘Qt Signals And Slots’ from Antonis
        Tsapaliokas from[KDE](//www.kde.org/) and continued with another
        workshop from the people of [The-Hackerspace](//the-hackerspace.org/) titled ‘Security and arduino: Wireless devices remote control (client
        – server control center)’. There was a dinner break and then continued with a ‘Vim
        introduction’ by [Yannis Chatzimichos](//y.chatz.gr/blog) which was
        really interesting and showed people why Vim is better than other editors. After that there
        was the previous days scheduled talk from Diomidis Anidiotis titled ‘I’m new in the community’
        where he talked about how new people to a FOSS community feel entering a community. It was a
        great feedback for all and this lead to the next and last planned conversation for the day
        which was ‘Collaborating inside a FOSS community’, where all people expressed their opinion
        about how people should do that. Many valuable conclusions were made there. Of course once
        again people went to the pool-bar afterward and continued the conversation there.

Sunday was the last day and it started around 10:00 after breakfast with the Gnome
        community and[Efstathios Iosifidis](//stathisuse.blogspot.com/) presenting ‘Surviving with Gnome 3 in a KDE-world’. Efstathios Agrapidis
        took up the baton presenting ‘I’m OBS-ing, are you OBS-ing too?’. Unfortunately there were
        some internet issues so instead of the OBS workshop, after the OBS presentation we had [Theo Chatzimichos](//blogs.gentoo.org/tampakrap/) (due to popular demand)
        continuing the workshop on Django. After that came George Tsapaliokas presenting ‘KDE
        Frameworks’ and how to work with them. The day finished with a talk from [Athanasios-Ilias Rousinopoulos](//zoumpis.wordpress.com/) titled ‘openSUSE
        Medical project’ where as the new project leader he talked to us about it and why we should
        all help this project.

As you can see from the photos, the event was a success as it reached its goal providing
        education through presentations, workshops and discussions, all that through summer
        entertainment.

Most important, all participants are impatiently looking forward to the next event! Soon
        the videos of the workshops and talks will be available at [YouTube](//www.youtube.com/user/opensusetv), stay tuned…

Special Thanks to Giorgos Tsapaliokas and [Stella Rouzi](//en-gb.facebook.com/differentreality) for helping more from
        all on organizing the whole event. Also the Greek openSUSE community really wants to thank the
        people from [Gentoo](//www.gentoo.org/), [KDE](//www.kde.org/), [The-Hackerspace](//the-hackerspace.org/) and[Yannis Chatzimichos](//y.chatz.gr/blog) for participating at the event with their valuable and really interesting
        presentations and workshops.

Please refer to my [previous

  * Quick résumé :

  * There’s no full changelog about them, but [Catalyst 11.7 installer](//www2.ati.com/relnotes/Catalyst_11.7_Linux_Installer.pdf) (pdf)

  * Get the cheat-sheet [11.6 version](//www.sebastian-siebert.de/downloads/ati-catalyst-11.7-cheat-sheet.pdf)

  * Kernel supported up to 3.0x version

  * Removed support of openSUSE 11.2, if you are still using it with Evergreen
                        project, the repository still exist with older version

  * Wrong (to my point of view) create an xorg.conf file which is unneeded if
                        you work with /etc/xorg.conf.d/50-device.conf and have driver

In some cases you can’t trust the connection but you need to go online and read some mails or share some documents. In this case some basic tools like SSH and Firefox can help you to build an secure connection to an known computer in the internet you can trust (for example your own root server).

To make more clear what I am talking about i created this small diagram to make it more easy for me to explain what I am doing with this SSH connection and how I can benefit from it. (...)

        [Wazi/Dmitry Kaglik: How To Create an Ebook with OpenOffice.org](//olex.openlogic.com/wazi/2011/how-to-create-an-ebook-with-openoffice-org/)
      

Do you want to see your name on the front page of a book? It’s easier than you might think. First, write the book. Next, follow these simple steps to prepare an ebook using the free OpenOffice.org desktop publishing application.

Publishing ebooks today can be a DIY business. If you write for a specific audience, you can create a successful book without the help of big companies, and get your work into the hands of readers who can download ebooks from popular sites such as Amazon CreateSpace, Lulu, or Lightning Source.

Let’s assume you’ve already written the book you want to publish. Your work might be in plain text format or written using a word processing application. No matter where it starts out, import it into OOo Writer and use that program’s rich set of tools to create a file for publication. (...)

        [Linux.com/Jack Wallen: Advanced Layering Techniques on Linux with GIMP](//www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/477968-advanced-layering-techniques-on-linux-with-gimp)
      

The [GNU Image Manipulation Program](//www.gimp.org/) (GIMP) is one of the most powerful image editing tools available. It is, effectively, the Photoshop of the open source world; and with that kind of title comes a level of power most never take advantage of. One feature that should be a must-use for all digital artists is the layer. Using layers not only makes work easier, it gives digital art more depth and more flexibility.

What I want to do is to illustrate some of the more advanced methods for using layering in GIMP. Once these techniques have been mastered, creating and editing digital masterpieces will be so much easier. I will assume the basics of layers is understood (such as how to add, copy, and delete layers), so the 101-level layer steps will not be discussed.(...)

For example you are running a backup with rsync or doing a tar, but you do not want these processes use all your CPU, in these cases you can make use of the nice command. (...)

        [ServerWatch/Joe Brockmeier: Try collectl for System Monitoring](//www.serverwatch.com/tutorials/article.php/3937996/Try-collectlfor-System-Monitoring.htm)
      

Most Linux system administrators are familiar with sar for collecting system status data. However, there's a few ways that sar shows its age and doesn't quite live up to expectations. If you're looking for a newer utility that also handles NFS, Slab data and sub-second intervals, [collectl](//collectl.sourceforge.net/) may better fit the bill.

The collectl utility was written by Mark Seger, and it is dual-licensed under the Artistic License and GNU General Public License (GPL). It's written in Perl and does a bit more than [just read from /proc and copy data to the terminal](//collectl.sourceforge.net/Architecture.html). (...)

        Harmony horrors](//blog.jospoortvliet.com/2011/07/harmony-horrors.html)

Besides the [positive
        things](//blog.jospoortvliet.com/2011/07/kde-release-on-radio-antwerp.html), there's some less nice stuff to talk about.

On the other side of the web, I [kept discussing Harmony
        with Allison (Canonical)](//allisonrandal.com/2011/07/16/harmony-1-0-reflections/) until I asked something and got no response anymore.

Bringing up arguments like "it provides more clarity to
        contributors, a 'check point' to look at the legal situation and reassurance of legal status
        to users" or the already-debunked "but it is helps
        protect the copyrights and handling of disappearing contributors" doesn't
      convince me that contributors should sign away their code while running the risk **TO GET SUED BY THE COMPANY THEY JUST GAVE THEIR CODE TO FOR WRITING IT IN THE

      It was brought to my attention that there was no mentioning this event in the previous openSUSE Weekly News. Well, here it is. Like with the Milestones for the previous releases, we see growing activity in the forums with each new milestone release. Members test, try, use them, they report bugs, all to make openSUSE 12.1 better than any openSUSE before. Read the thread, read about issues, features, follow what's going on on the road to openSUSE 12.1, to be released in November 2011.

      A big hand to the KDE developpers for delivering KDE 4.7. Not just some small maintenance update, but lots of new features, furhter integration of applications in the desktop, better interaction between applications. As usual a quite a lot of KDE users want to see what it would mean for them, so they look for updates. The thread provides links to a new KDE:Release:47 repo. At the moment KDE 4.7 has not yet landed in the Tumbleweed repos, the advice to Tumbleweed users is to wait a bit.

      At first glance I would say, that it's normal to run into trouble when doing what this member did: perform a 32bit install from DVD first, then perform a 64bit install on the same root partition afterwards, where, as far as I understood, the 32bit install was not erased, but overwritten. Well, the story has a happy ending, though not easily reached. Like always, attempts to repair have one major requirement: backup anything you want to keep, before even starting to attempt.

        [Peter Penz: Introducing Dolphin 2.0](//ppenz.blogspot.com/2011/08/introducing-dolphin-20.html)
      

During the last months I've been working on Dolphin 2.0 which is planned to get released
        with the 4.8 release of KDE Applications. Dolphin 2.0 will get a new "view-engine" that will
        have several improvements in comparison to the current version.

Well, what means "view-engine" in the scope of Dolphin? The view-engine is responsible
        for showing the directory content as icons and text. In a very simplified form it can be
        seen as the sum of Dolphin's "icons mode", "details mode" and "columns mode". (...)

It was big news when the 3.0 kernel was released at the end of July, but as luck would
        have it, another fundamental piece of your average distribution is about to bump its own
        version number up to 3.0 as well: the [filesystem hierarchy standard](//www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/lsb/fhs) (FHS). If you're not sure exactly what that means or why you should care,
        don't worry. It's the distros that implement the FHS — when it goes well, all you know is
        that your system runs smoothly. But that doesn't mean there's nothing important hidden away
        in this new release. (...)

GPL violations are a dime a dozen. Some are intentional, some are not — but I don't think I've ever seen one quite as surprising as [this one](https://lwn.net/Articles/453374/#Comments). Yes, Richard Stallman has sent out a note letting everybody know that the 23.2 and 23.3 releases of GNU Emacs are in violation of the GPL. Says Stallman, "We have made a very bad mistake. Anyone redistributing those versions is violating the GPL, through no fault of his own." (...)

NetAFP, the Netatalk developers, have announced that they are to resume open development of Netatalk and have updated the project's git repository with the latest source. In early July, NetAFP, the Netatalk developers, [announced](//www.h-online.com/news/item/Current-Netatalk-code-only-with-cash-say-developers-1273711.html) they were only making the source code for Netatalk 2.2.0 available to paying customers. The timing of the move was well chosen as, within weeks of that, Apple released its latest version of Mac OS X, Lion, which uses AFP ([Apple Filing Protocol](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Filing_Protocol)) 3.3. The latest version of AFP mandates support for [Replay Cache](//developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Networking/Conceptual/AFP/AFPReplayCache/AFPReplayCache.html) functionality and this feature is also required by Lion's Time Machine.

        [Linux Journal/Susan Linton: LibreOffice Developer Glimpse Proves Balance](//www.linuxjournal.com/content/libreoffice-developer-glimpse-proves-balance)
      

Florian Effenberger recently posted statistics of the number of developers contributing to the LibreOffice project. Several months ago, Cedric Bosdonnat offered data on the number of contribution and contributors from the various sources. While Effenberger's post provides much less detail, it still provides a glimpse into the composition of the growing community.

According to commit counts it seems 54 developers from Oracle, everybody's favorite bad guy these days, has the highest employee count. This was a full 18% of all commits. As Italo Vignoli explained, "Oracle contributions are related to the OOo code that has been merged with LibreOffice, and in fact the number of commits has decreased dramatically during the last few months. There are, though, some former Oracle developers contributing on a volunteer basis to LibreOffice." (...)
