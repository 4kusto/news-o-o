[It’s that time of year
        again: openSUSE@LinuxTag Berlin](//news.opensuse.org/2011/05/03/linuxtag11/)

Again this year, same procedure as every year, the **openSUSE Project
        is attending the [LinuxTag in Berlin](//www.linuxtag.org/)**
      with more than 30 members, a booth, several talks in the program and workshops. LinuxTag has
      been held regularly for 15 years, which is longer than any other Linux fair in Europe. More
      than 200 free software projects and companies participate and it attracts nearly 12,000
      visitors. The 17th LinuxTag presents all the latest for professional users, decision makers,
      developers, beginners and the Linux community — **May 11 to 14 at the
        Berlin Fairgrounds**.

[Christos Bountalis: About GSoC proposal “fillup-ng”](//cbounta.wordpress.com/2011/04/30/about-gsoc-proposal-fillup-ng/)

Recently I have found out that my GSoC proposal was accepted. Therefore, I thought that it
      would be nice to introduce myself and the project I will work on, to the community.

**A few words about me**

My name is Christos “mpounta” Bountalis and I am slightly over 24, I live in [Salamis](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salamis_Island) a small island near Athens
      in Greece. I am currently in my final year studying towards a BSc degree in Computer Science.
      I spend my free time programming, listening to music, tweaking my system, hanging out with
      friends and occasionally playing soccer. I consider GSoC to be a great opportunity for me to
      join the openSUSE developers community in a more introductory way. and I plan to take
      advantage of it ![](//s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1263084109g) .

[Alex Eftimie: GSoC 2011: PackageKit and AppStream integration for Software
      Center](//alex.eftimie.ro/2011/05/05/gsoc-2011-packagekit-and-appstream-integration-for-software-center/)

Hi everyone,

Just a quick announce that I will be working this summer as a GSoC student, for the
      openSUSE Project. My mentor will be [Vincent Untz](//vuntz.net), the so
      called “father of GNOME 3”
      ![](//alex.eftimie.ro/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)

What I’m aiming to do is modify Ubuntu Software Center to use PackageKit (an universal
      package management toolkit) as a installation backend, and also integrate it with the
      AppStream initiative (a cross-distro project for making software installation easier).

My full proposal can be read [here (fixed)](//swarm.cs.pub.ro/%7Ealexef/gsoc/proposal.html). Feedback and
      suggestions are, as always, appreciated.

I would like to thank [ROSEdu](//www.rosedu.org/gsoc) (which I am a
      member of) for the support ![](//alex.eftimie.ro/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif)

Hi everyone,

two news for this week-end :

  * GNOME 3.0.1 is now available for openSUSE 11.4, in GNOME:STABLE:3.0 repository.
                See //en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GNOME_3.0 on how to use this repository.

  * Live image has been regenerated to use GNOME 3.0.1. It is available at
                //www.gnome.org/getting-gnome/ (version 1.2.0)

Oh, I forgot : GNOME3 promo DVDs have been delivered to GNOME Foundation ;)
          Enjoy!

          [Nelson Marques: Mockup :: GNOME3 and YaST](//lizards.opensuse.org/2011/04/30/mockup-gnome3-and-yast/)
        

With the release of GNOME3 I would assume that people are interested in seeing how
          YaST2 (suggestion: rename it to YaST3 !!) is going to take form with GTK3. Of course this
          means eventually writing another application in GTK3, hopefully different from the old
          gnome-control-panel ‘style’ which was actually pretty confusion from the user point of
          view as it was far too close to gnome-control-center, thus confusing new comers.

My suggestion (unaware if it’s possible or not) was probably to explore GNOME3
          features to serve YaST integrated already with GNOME3. This could be an interesting
          approach as it would offer integration and some advantages:

* Better integration with GNOME3 without having to write(/maintain another
          application;

* Take advantage of YaST2 modular structure;

* Present YaST in a prime space in GNOME3, thus offering a
          openSUSEýdifferentiationýpoint;

* No conflicts with possible KDE existing front-ends for YaST2;

* Improve users experience.

My proposal would be something like (maybe to be served as an extension for
        gnome-shell). Please neglect my ‘lame’ photo manipulation skills:

          [Sebastian Kügler: Plasma Active at Tokamak 5](//vizzzion.org/blog/2011/04/plasma-active-at-tokamak-5/)
        

Our two big topics at Tokamak 5 are infrastructural changes and libplasma2, and Plasma
          Active. In a session yesterday, we discussed the Plasma Active shell, and how we want to
          interact with it. The discussion was very fruitful, and based on a mockup by Riccardo, we
          decided to implement a top panel that you can drag out, offering access to the window
          switcher, the “system tray”, and a couple of other things. That’s quite a big visual
          change from what we have right now, but it allows us to achieve a number of interaction
          cleanups. Let’s look in more detail what we’re doing here: 

  * **Window switching** – The top panel has a
                horizontal window list, which you can use to switch between app windows and widgets
                in your workspaces. The window decoration is going away, windows can be closed from
                the window list. The present windows effect has this already implemented, as a
                trashcan you can swipe your window into. It works pretty well and is snazzy. 

  * **Semantic Resource Visualization** – In order to
                display things like files, contacts, bookmarks,
                music, etc. we use separate QML elements for different uses (items in a listview,
                for example). The data comes directly from Nepomuk. This part is also starting to
                work, we can list different resources, and based on its type (defined in the
                ontologies), it will choose a suitable QML file to display this Thing in a suitable way and allow for interaction with
                it. 

  * **Storage of bookmarks** – As most of the
                information we use in Plasma Active is coming from Nepomuk, we decided to store the
                bookmarks in there as well. The NFO Ontology has classes for Bookmark and Bookmark
                folder, which is what we’re using here. Last night I’ve restructured the
                metadataengine to make it easier to build special purpose dataengines on top of
                that. These dataengines allow for easy access and usage in QML / Plasma
                Quick.

  * **Web Dashboard** – I’m doing some work on a nice
                way to view your bookmarks, as interacting with the web is an important use-case of
                Plasma Active. We now have (cached) previews of webpages, we can use directly in
                QML. Combined with the dataengine that lists bookmarks, it’s now easy to implement a
                bookmarks browser, done entirely in Plasma Quick, shippable as
                architecture-independent package. Connecting these bits and pieces is next on th
                list.

Some of these things are working already, others materialise as we speak, some will
          surely stay on our list until after Tokamak, so we’ve got something to hack on when
          everybody’s back. :) (...)

I wanted to open a fate feature about this when I first heard of plymouth, but
            reading
            //fedoramagazine.wordpress.com/2008/10/21/interview-fedora-10s-better-startup/
            really makes me think we should go this way.

Ray's comment starting with "Every flicker and mode change in the boot
            process takes away from the whole experience." is especially interesting. Is it
            okay to track the "don't show grub by default" here?

            [Update to GRUB v2 (Score: 118)](https://features.opensuse.org/308497)
          

Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn't
            going to go away. The code itself isn't well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It's only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don't have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

We need a feedback about packages that are preferred by users and actively used. Debian already has a tool named Popularity contest (popcon)

    

* reusing popcon will give us results that are directly comparable with Debian and Ubuntu
    

* packagers team can take care of the package
    

* we need a configuration dialog in YaST that is visible enough
    

* we need a server infrastructure on opensuse.org. (There are certain privacy issues, see Debian FAQ for details)

            [Improved partitioning suggestions for full encrypted installations](https://features.opensuse.org/312292)
          

Since the full system encryption was enabled in the openSUSE installation, there was every release a problem with the automatic partitioning suggestions.


Concrete: The installation systems always gives me a partition table that waste, don't use, the greatest part of my harddrive.


So I have to do the modification manual, which was the first time a strange learning and takes a big amount of time.



It would looks much more professional when this little bug would be fixed for the next distro release.

This is one really really really annoying feature in yast. Here is the scenario, you have a machine with a bunch of storage drives, drives that are normally kept full. Everytime you enter something like package management in YaST it pops up a low disk space warning. This warning should only apply for volumes where YaST utilizes for it's files (such as download cache, home, etc). A HTPC for example often has volumes full to the max.

      [h-online/Thorsten Leemhuis: Kernel Log: Coming in 2.6.39 (Part 3) - Architecture and
        infrastructure](//www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-2-6-39-Part-3-Architecture-and-infrastructure-1238914.html)
    

**In 2.6.39, the Big Kernel Lock (BKL) disappears for good. The kernel
        can now process interrupts, which reduces latency. The Xen code now has a network backend
        needed for Dom0 operation, but it doesn't look like the storage backend will be coming
        anytime soon.**

On Wednesday morning, Linus Torvalds [released](//thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1135043) the sixth release
      candidate of Linux kernel 2.6.39. It contains several mostly minor changes. Torvalds says
      kernel developers are still looking into a number of problems, so it will not be the last RC,
      and it will probably be more than 10 days before 2.6.39 is released.

Prompted by the progress in 2.6.39, the Kernel Log is taking this opportunity to continue
      the mini-series “Coming in 2.6.39” with a description of the innovations in the
      kernel's infrastructure and architecture code. The [first part](//www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-2-6-39-Part-1-Network-drivers-and-infrastructure-1227053.html) dealt with changes to network drivers and infrastructure; [the second](//www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-2-6-39-Part-2-Storage-and-file-systems-1232317.html), with storage and file system code. An article on drivers will follow
      next week.

        [LinuxJournal/Joey Bernard: Linux on a Fingernail](//www.linuxjournal.com/content/linux-fingernail)
      

![](//www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/ufiles/imagecache/node-page/nodeimage/story/10969pocketf1.inline_2.jpg)

This issue of Linux Journal is all about how to get
        Linux in your pocket. In this article, I go one better and tell you how to get Linux on your
        fingernail. Now, before you get too excited, I won't be discussing some new nano-computer
        being used by James Bond, unfortunately. Instead, I discuss how to put Linux on a micro-SD
        card (or any other USB drive, for that matter). Using this, you can run Linux on any machine
        that can boot off a USB device. 

One of the first utilities to receive widespread attention and use is UNetbootin ([//unetbootin.sourceforge.net](//unetbootin.sourceforge.net)). This
        application is available under both Linux and Windows. It has built-in support for
        downloading and installing several Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian,
        PCLinuxOS, Linux Mint, Sabayon Linux, openSUSE, Gentoo, Arch Linux, MEPIS and many others.

When you're ready to move up from simple audio recording applications like GNOME's Sound Recorder, take a look at the excellent [Ardour digital audio workstation](//ardour.org/). Ardour is one of the shining jewels of FOSS, a robust professional-level multi-channel recorder, editor, and mixer. Follow along as we learn the basics by making a simple recording. You will need a computer with a sound card, even a cheapo on-board chip, and a microphone or instrument to plug in to your sound card. (...)

        [N.B.Prashanth: Radio Buttons, Combo Boxes and Event Handling](//nbprashanth.wordpress.com/2011/05/02/radio-buttons-combo-boxes-and-event-handling/)
      

Welcome back! Today we will walk through a slightly bigger example to understand the way
        event handling works in YUI. We will also learn use two new widgets that we see in almost
        all the applications we use : Radio Buttons and Combo Boxes.

We will create a program that contains a combo box, two radio buttons, a label and a
        push button. The radio buttons are called immediate and event1. If immediate is selected,
        the label reflects the selected value of the combo box without clicking the push button. If
        event1 radio button is selected, the push button has to be clicked for the label to reflect
        the value of the selected element of the combo box. Simple concept, right?

Before we proceed, please note that all the examples found in this blog are available at
        : [https://gitorious.org/libyui](https://gitorious.org/libyui). So feel
        free to compile and see the output for yourself! (ofcourse, only on openSUSE at the moment.)

        [HTMLGoodies/Arpan Dhandhania: How To Create Custom Select Menus with CSS](//www.htmlgoodies.com/beyond/css/how-to-create-custom-select-menus-with-css.html)
      

HTML and CSS have come a long way from where they started. In the 90's, before CSS was formally introduced, the focus was purely on the functionality of web pages. They looked ugly, but no one really complained since they were not aware of what promises CSS would bring. The only way to make the page look beautiful was to use loads of images but the lack of high speed internet connections prevented developers from using that approach since it hampered the user's experience.



Over the years, as CSS advanced, it enabled the developer to style certain form elements like text fields and textareas. Other elements like select menus, radio buttons and checkboxes were left unstylable. When I first read the discussions about CSS3 on the internet, I became hopeful that it will allow us to style these form elements too. Unfortunately, my wishes were not granted. So until they do, we are forced to use work-around solutions for it. (...)

        openSUSE: Let the user decide if in doubt](//kdeatopensuse.wordpress.com/2011/05/05/let-the-user-decide-if-in-doubt/)

If it comes to decisions there is always the aim to just do the right thing. In a lot of
      cases there is the one right thing. In quite a few cases there is no right thing but the
      consequences are small enough that it does not really matter which decision one takes. And
      then there are those use-cases where the only right thing to do is to ask the user because any
      other decision would just be guessing and lead to RAM and CPU wasting.

Yet even in the latter situations some apps are too lazy to ask the user or even claim
      that not asking the user – not even once – is the best solution – and even more astonishing:
      for the user’s good. So basically they claim to be smarter than the user or just do not care
      about the user’s resources or opinion. (...)

My team has been busy the last months with the release of SUSE Manager, which was received
      with very good reviews. There is lot of room for improvements, some of them specific to SUSE
      products/integration but others in Spacewalk itself.

There is lot of work to do and lot of patches being reviewed. Lot of them are already
      upstream.

One common question is: if I already have a Spacewalk server, how do I setup openSUSE
      clients?

Thanks to Michael Calmer, we submitted the required packages to a repository in the
      openSUSE Build Service. You can find the instructions looking for the SUSE section in the
        “Registering Clients” page of the official Spacewalk wiki.

It was brought to my attention through I [article](//karl-tux-stadt.de/ktuxs/?p=3176) (german) the existence of
      [gpick](//code.google.com/p/gpick/), an advanced and high featured
      color picker. I’ve taken a quick look at it to make it available for openSUSE as it seems an
      interesting tool for artists and web designers (maybe GTK3+ themers) and others.

To build this package a few files are generated with the [Lemon Parser Generator](//www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/) which isn’t really
      available. I’m contacting upstream regarding the possibility of including the generated
      files in the tarball, or eventually if that fails, I’ll probably need to include lemon.c,
      hand compile it and hack scons build to use the local binary to generate those files.

      Well, talking about "different", one could say a lot about GNOME 3, at least one of the things should that it's different. Different compared to GNOME 2, compared to the other linux desktops as well. It needs some maturing, but it's funcional, and on my laptop it's stable for what I use it for: browsing, mail, work. Then, when we have all that, we want to apply some changes to the look and feel etc. This thread is about how to do this. Our member malcolmlewis is running his feet off to provide GNOME 3 users with advice, support and suggestions on how to configure GNOME 3. I suggest GNOME 3 users to join the forums, and read his contributions in various threads. It brought me a nice and comfortable GNOME 3 experience.

        will be keeping SUSE Linux as a spin-off company, [Mono](//www.mono-project.com/Main_Page), the open-source implementation
        of Windows’ .NET, is being shut down and there have been hundreds of additional Novell
        layoffs. So much for business as usual.

In a statement, Hawn told me, “We have re-established Nuremburg [Germany] as the headquarters of our [SUSE business unit](//www.novell.com/linux/) and the prioritization and resourcing of certain development efforts–including Mono–will now be determined by the business unit leaders there. This change led to the release of some US based employees today.
