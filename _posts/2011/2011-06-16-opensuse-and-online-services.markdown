The 'cloud' has been a buzzword for quite a while. While some are still rather cynical towards the concept, products like [mobile phones with Android](//www.android.com/) have shown the value of putting your data in that [huge, amorphous network of servers somewhere](//xkcd.com/908/). Apple recently [introduced their new cloud service](//www.apple.com/icloud/) and Microsoft has their [cloud](//www.microsoft.com/cloud) too. So with the other major players talking cloudy, what does Linux have?


## Variety


Let's define Cloud technology as 'related to putting data online & sharing among devices' which is a reasonable definition for our purposes. There is a huge number of technologies connecting openSUSE users to online services.  However there is a distinction to be made between commercial or proprietary operating systems and ours.   We don't create a vendor lock-in scenario because we focus on tools that freely connect you to your choice of publicly available services.  This is a key distinction because we're not owning or controlling the cloud that you place your data in.  You, the user, get to decide the place where it best fits your needs and comfort level.  Today and tomorrow we will highlight some of them here, starting with integration in our every day applications.<!-- more -->


## Integration with online services




**install Tomahawk**

openSUSE 11.3


openSUSE brings online services like [Facebook](//facebook.com), [Flickr](//flickr.com) and [Youtube](//youtube.com) to your desktop in a variety of applications. New applications like [UMPlayer](//www.umplayer.com/) and [Tomahawk](//tomahawk-player.org/) go out of their way to deeply integrate [twitter](//twitter.com) or [last.fm](//last.fm), with Tomahawk even able to play music over a jabber (google-talk) chat connection. Of course, old-timers like [Banshee](//banshee.fm/) and Amarok also feature music from music stores, pod casts and other on-line services.

Image viewers have engaged online services for a while. [F-Spot](//f-spot.org/Features) can export to [Flickr](//www.flickr.com/), [23](//www.23hq.com/), [Picasa Web](//picasaweb.google.com/) or [SmugMug](//www.smugmug.com/). [Shotwell](//yorba.org/shotwell/) can even export to Youtube. KDE applications [Digikam](//www.digikam.org/drupal/about/features9x) and it's companion Showfoto add [Facebook](//facebook.com), [piwigo](//piwigo.org/), [shwup](//www.shwup.com/), [zooomr](//www.zooomr.com/) and some other sites to the list. They can also export to a HTML gallery and put the images with the locations they were taken at on Google Maps. This is shared KDE infrastructure so you can expect image viewer [Gwenview](//gwenview.sourceforge.net/) and even screenshot application [ksnapshot](//www.elpauer.org/?p=509) to be able to directly share over these services.


**install UMPlayer**

It's not just media tools which integrate with online services. [LibreOffice](//www.libreoffice.org/) can export and import documents from online office suites like [Google Docs](//docs.google.com) and [Zoho](//zoho.com). And of course, mail/agenda/news clients like [Evolution](//projects.gnome.org/evolution) and [KDE PIM](//pim.kde.org) have offered integration with online services like mail or calendaring forever. Feed readers like [Liferea](//liferea.sourceforge.net/) offer syncing your news feed with [Google Reader](//www.google.com/reader) and [TinyTinyRSS](//tt-rss.org/).

Besides integrating with existing services, Free Software projects are starting their own. Prominent examples are GNOME's [Tomboy](//projects.gnome.org/tomboy/) which synchronizes your notes between instances using an online service.

But there is more available for openSUSE. There are several file sharing and syncing services out there. Read about that in [part II](//news.opensuse.org/2011/06/17/opensuse-and-your-own-cloud/).
