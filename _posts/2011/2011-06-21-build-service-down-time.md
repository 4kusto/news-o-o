We are currently facing a hardware problem with the openSUSE Build Service.

Affected services are:



	
  * [//build.opensuse.org](//build.opensuse.org/)

	
  * [//api.opensuse.org](//api.opensuse.org/)

	
  * [//software.opensuse.org](//software.opensuse.org)


We are trying to resolve this as fast as possible. Apologies for inconveniences this may cause.

Please contact admin@opensuse.org with any queries.

**Update 18:53 UTC:** Everything is up and running again. Note the build service scheduler needs to read all files now and create some data structures. It will take a few hours until the build service is building again packages.
