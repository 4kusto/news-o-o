Introducing people to the world of free and open source software (_FOSS_) has always been a priority for the openSUSE project. We're not only doing so for new users with our distribution ([did you get 12.1 yet?](//news.opensuse.org/2011/11/16/opensuse-12-1-all-green/)) or for new contributors with [our project](//en.opensuse.org/Portal:How_to_participate), we also frequently participate in programs like Googles _Summer of Code_ or _Code in_. Those programs have introduced a lot of new contributors to both openSUSE and the FOSS community. So with pride we announce that, after a successful participation in Google Summer of Code this year, openSUSE will also participate in [Google Code-in](//google-melange.com/).

[![Code-in 2011 Logo](/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/200px-GCI.jpg)](//www.google-melange.com/gci/homepage/google/gci2011)Googles _Code-in_ is a program aimed at pre-university students between the age of 13 and 17. It starts on the 21. November, 2011. For this program we provide a list of tasks that are both fun and challenging for the students. Students who work on these tasks get a designated mentor assigned who will guide and help them. The tasks students can pick vary from writing or re-factoring code to doing marketing for the project. Simply everything a FOSS project has to do. Students can of course select tasks according to their interests.

On completion of a task students get points and  can earn prizes like t-shirts, cash and certificates of completion. The  ten participants with the highest points earned by the end of the  competition receive a grand prize trip to Google headquarters!


## Doing your bit


For a successful _Code In_ participation we all must do our bit. You can do two things:

**0. Suggest tasks on our [wiki page](//en.opensuse.org//openSUSE:GCI_Tasks)**
If you can think of a fun and challenging tasks for a pre-university student just go to the opensuse _Code In_ [wiki page](//en.opensuse.org//openSUSE:GCI_Tasks) and press the "Add task" button in the appropriate category. It's as easy as checkers :-) If we find a someone willing to mentor the task it will be part of _Code In_.

**1. Become a mentor on [google melange](//www.google-melange.com/gci/profile/google/gci2011) and help students complete their tasks.**
If you want to help mentoring the students for the tasks they choose you have to sign up as mentor on [google melange](//www.google-melange.com/gci/profile/google/gci2011) and [tell me](mailto:manugupt1@gmail.com) (Manu Gupta) about it so I can add you to our organization in that tool. Once you are a mentor you can pick/add the tasks you want to mentor.


## Both bits are easy to do but have great impact on our own project and FOSS in general. Great benefit for low cost. Please think hard about joining our efforts!
