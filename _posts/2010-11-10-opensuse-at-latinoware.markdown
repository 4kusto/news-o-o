ï»¿ï»¿At [Latinoware](http://www.latinoware.org/), a team of openSUSE contributors will come together, not only toÂ promote openSUSE but also to talk with each other about the future plans forÂ the major linux distribution in Brazil. openSUSE has some awesome technologyÂ and great people - both deserve more attention than they get and this is whatÂ the openSUSE ambassadors will talk about!

At the conference, you can expect the following talks by openSUSE people:Â A11y: Its about you! by Bryen "suseROCKs" Yunashko, international GNOME andÂ openSUSE marketing and Accessibility expert; and "Why are you here?" by JosÂ Poortvliet, openSUSE community manager for Novell. He will be very friendlyÂ and the talk will feature kittens.

For those interested in educational software on linux, openSUSE ambassadorÂ Carlos Alberto dos Santos Ribeiro, one of the central openSUSE people inÂ Brazil will talk about openSUSE Edu Li-f-e. There are two talks by ambassadorÂ Rogerio Ferreira: Xen for Dummies (about visualization on linux) andÂ "Automatizando Tarefas ao Extremo com Shell e Expect". Conference co-organizerÂ and all-round cool girl Izabel Cerqueira Valverde will talk about "GNOME WomenÂ & openSUSE Women - Mulheres e seus espaÃ§os".Â Her brother, Ricardo Cerqueira Valverde will discuss "openSUSE apresentaÂ Realidade Aumentada em Linux". Silvio Palmieri talks about "LaboratÃ³rio de A aÂ Z". And the openSUSE buildservice is covered by Alexandre Duarte Rogoski inÂ "openSUSE BuildService - Construindo Softwares para Diversas Plataformas eÂ DistribuiÃ§Ãµes"

On Friday the ambassadors will have a meeting with their international guestsÂ and anyone else who is interested in contributing to openSUSE.
