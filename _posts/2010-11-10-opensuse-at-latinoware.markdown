﻿﻿At [Latinoware](http://www.latinoware.org/), a team of openSUSE contributors will come together, not only to promote openSUSE but also to talk with each other about the future plans for the major linux distribution in Brazil. openSUSE has some awesome technology and great people - both deserve more attention than they get and this is what the openSUSE ambassadors will talk about!

At the conference, you can expect the following talks by openSUSE people: A11y: Its about you! by Bryen "suseROCKs" Yunashko, international GNOME and openSUSE marketing and Accessibility expert; and "Why are you here?" by Jos Poortvliet, openSUSE community manager for Novell. He will be very friendly and the talk will feature kittens.

For those interested in educational software on linux, openSUSE ambassador Carlos Alberto dos Santos Ribeiro, one of the central openSUSE people in Brazil will talk about openSUSE Edu Li-f-e. There are two talks by ambassador Rogerio Ferreira: Xen for Dummies (about visualization on linux) and "Automatizando Tarefas ao Extremo com Shell e Expect". Conference co-organizer and all-round cool girl Izabel Cerqueira Valverde will talk about "GNOME Women & openSUSE Women - Mulheres e seus espaços". Her brother, Ricardo Cerqueira Valverde will discuss "openSUSE apresenta Realidade Aumentada em Linux". Silvio Palmieri talks about "Laboratório de A a Z". And the openSUSE buildservice is covered by Alexandre Duarte Rogoski in "openSUSE BuildService - Construindo Softwares para Diversas Plataformas e Distribuições"

On Friday the ambassadors will have a meeting with their international guests and anyone else who is interested in contributing to openSUSE.
