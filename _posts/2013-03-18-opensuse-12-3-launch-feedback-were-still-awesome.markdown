Last week we let [openSUSE 12.3 out of the gate](https://news.opensuse.org/2013/03/13/opensuse-12-3-free-open-and-awesome/). Like always, it was exciting and fun to see the result of so much preparation get to our users! So, how did it go and what did we learn?<!-- more -->


## Conversations


We had great conversations with you on [google plus](https://plus.google.com/b/110312141834246266844/+opensuse/posts) and we were very happy that 40 people joined the openSUSE team hangout on the release day! Too bad there is a limit of 10 people in a hangout - we know many of you wanted to join but couldn't. With over 20.000 people following our Plus account it is far ahead of the 7K people in our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/opensuseproject/) or the almost 6000 liking our [openSUSE Page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/openSUSE/45393742283). But there were good discussions there as well - and the same on the blogs. We appreciate the feedback. Many blogs also give valuable tips to users, a selection that is very much worth reading:



	
  * [Jean-Nicoloas Artaud - as easy as 1-2-3](http://morice.ipsquad.net/blog/?p=29) shows how easy upgrading to 12.3 is

	
  * [Bruno Friedman: openSUSE 12.3 and NVIDIA drivers](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2013/03/17/opensuse-12-3-12-2-and-nvidia-drivers/) on how to get video acceleration with the NVIDIA drivers

	
  * [Richard Brown: Intel Power Management on openSUSE 12.3](http://www.sysrich.co.uk/?p=190) on powermanagement

	
  * [Robert Schweikert: One that got away â€“ 12.3 Networking](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2013/03/13/one-that-got-away-12-3-networking/) explaining how to solve the networking issue which managed to get in our final release...


Meanwhile, our [openSUSE group on Google+](https://plus.google.com/b/110312141834246266844/communities/115444043324891769569) has still plenty of space and we're of course also [still tweeting](https://twitter.com/openSUSE/)! And a tip: we appreciate it if you re-tweet our messages to your own followers! We've got hundreds of plusses and shares on Google but a mere 33 retweets of our release announcement... Did you all leave twitter already?

## Reviews


Most major news sites spread our announcement to their readers (almost twice as much as for the 12.2 release, yay!) and we already have reviews rolling in:

And those are just in writing. You can find 4 more reviews in video form:

  * [openSUSE 12.3 review: KDE done right](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LxpbEsfcUE)



Watching them is worthwhile - especially the Linux Action Show review discusses the new release deeply. They liked the communication around the release and also noted that we _get our target audience_ by focusing on _pro_ technologies for Desktop and Server. Here, they noted that _"YaST2 is still relevant"_, demonstrating some of what it can do. But they also _"consider the Build Service now as one of the key features of openSUSE"_ and they love [our rolling release repository Tumbleweed](http://opensuse.org/Tumbleweed), noting that _"with Tumbleweed, openSUSE is going to be the best KDE experience going forward"_.

We're happy to have gotten the attention of them and so many others all around the web, thank you! More reviews are rolling in still, both video and text. We'll keep our [Press page](https://en.opensuse.org/In_the_press) up to date.


## The numbers


Now what many of you have been waiting for: _the 24 hour statistics_! openSUSE 12.2 [experienced a drop in downloads](https://news.opensuse.org/2013/01/23/opensuse-12-2-brought-to-you-by-an-extremely-talented-group-of-people/). We guessed that the delay of two months with the release meant many in our community were already using openSUSE 12.2 before it was released and we also think that since we support in-place upgrades and have introduced Tumbleweed, our existing user base has less need for the official media. For this release, we didn't have the delay, so despite the upgrades and tumbleweed, we hoped numbers would be up. And they are!

let's start with the server data. In openSUSE 12.1 we had [almost 94K downloads](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/11/19/opensuse-12-1-launch-feedback/) within the first 24 hours of the release. This went down to 65K with openSUSE 12.2, but we're up to 75K again!

Also, we've got about another 10K downloads via torrents on top of that. An interesting thing to note is that finally, 64bit has become the dominant architecture for openSUSE: where in previous releases the balance continued to hang around 50/50, we're now getting almost twice as many 64 bit downloads.

## Lessons learned


We're not done evaluating all that happened for 12.3, but at least we're glad we managed to avoid most of the issues mentioned in our [evaluation of 12.2](https://news.opensuse.org/2013/01/23/opensuse-12-2-brought-to-you-by-an-extremely-talented-group-of-people/). Our announcement and communication were ready in time thanks to [the Marketing and Artwork hackathon](https://news.opensuse.org/2013/02/21/opensuse-marketing-and-artwork-teams-got-work-done/), more time was spend on testing (we also organized [a testing hackathon](https://news.opensuse.org/2013/01/23/opensuse-12-3-hackfest-in-nuremberg-progress-on-arm-packagekit-and-many-bugs-fixed/)!) and our [Open Build Service](http://build.opensuse.org) did not have any major issues during the release. Our servers did falter for a minute during the release, due to the heavy load - but we managed. Still, however, the _'undirected hacking'_ still means we don't set goals in advance and we didn't have a clear list of features until we went through all of the changes in our release - _too much work for too little excitement_.

So, this release is a step forward - but there is still work to be done. We surely plan to talk about ideas on improving things at the upcoming [openSUSE Conference in Greece](//news.opensuse.org/2013/02/20/osc13-cfp/). Think about joining if you want to help out!
