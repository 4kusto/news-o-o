![](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/22/9a/89/a-cow-burger.jpg)In less than a week, openSUSE Tumbleweed had two snapshots that included new Linux Kernels.

[Snapshot 20161020](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-10/msg00539.html) brought users [Linux Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/) 4.8.3 and and four days later [snapshot 20161024](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-10/msg00593.html) brought the 4.8.4 [Linux Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/). A kernel patch for the Dirty Cow security vulnerability ([CVE-2016-5195](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-5195.html)) came quickly to the rolling release and was available by Saturday.

The snapshots in between the two kernel snapshots brought timezone updates in  [snapshot 20161023](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-10/msg00571.html) and KDE updates with [snapshot 20161022](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-10/msg00554.html).

[Snapshot 20161022](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-10/msg00554.html) fixed a three-year-old bung in [ghostscript](http://www.ghostscript.com/) fixing [CVE-2013-5653](http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=694724).

The snapshot also updated Plasma to [version 5.8.2](https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.8.2.php), the cross-distro collaboration package [AppStream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppStream) to 0.10.0 and python3-setuptools to 28.6.1. Php 5 updated to version 5.6.27 adding several subpackages and fixing several security bugs in the release.

KDE’s newest 5.8 version, which is an Long Term Support version for Plasma, provided subpackages for openSUSE branding and fix some bugs for [Bluedevil](https://userbase.kde.org/Bluedevil) and [Breeze](https://quickgit.kde.org/?p=breeze.git).
