Due to the positive fact that more proposals emerge, we wanted to take the time to make them into polished proposals that we want to publish for discussion as well.




Here's our new timeline:








	
  * Consolidate community proposals for discussion till July 25

	
  * Discuss proposals starting, July 27  (4 days for each discussion)

	
  * end of public discussions, Aug 10.

	
  * Create final proposals

	
  * Define voting and acceptance procedure

	
  * Start voting





As voting procedure is not yet defined we can't give a date on voting yet. To read what this Srategy discussion is all about you're invited to go [here](http://wiki.opensuse.org/Portal:Strategy) and especially see the difference between [strategy and activity](http://wiki.opensuse.org/openSUSE:What_is_Strategy#Strategy_versus_activities) . For a summary of the discussions already happened Pavol and Andreas put them [here](http://wiki.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Strategy_discussion_comments).
