The openSUSE Evergreen has [just announced](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-announce/2013-08/msg00000.html) that the upcoming openSUSE 13.1 will be the next Evergreen release. This means that the Evergreen team will continue to provide openSUSE 13.1 with with security updates and important bugfixes after the usual 18 month maintenance cycle until it has had a total life time of at least three years.


## What is Evergreen?


The openSUSE Evergreen team was started to keep openSUSE releases alive by issuing security and stability fixes after the regular 18-month lifespan of openSUSE releases. The team has kept selected releases maintained for an additional 18 to 30 months. The first Evergreen release was openSUSE 11.1. Current releases in the Evergreen maintenance program are openSUSE 11.2 to be maintained until November 2013 (a total of 4 years) and 11.4 to be maintained until July 2014 (reaching almost three-and-a-half).

You can find more information about Evergreen and how to keep your openSUSE release alive on the [Evergreen wiki page](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen).

_Have a lot of fun!_
