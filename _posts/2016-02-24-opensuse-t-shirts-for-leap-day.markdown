To celebrate Leap Day, openSUSE will ship you a Leap 42 T-Shirt when you [submit a proposal](http://bit.ly/1o1Nn7I) for this year’s [openSUSE Conference](http://bit.ly/1ZPVpSn) by Leap Day (Feb. 29, 2016). *Due to a technical problem with OSEM, the deadline for the T-Shirt offering is extended until March 1.

That’s right, if you have already submitted a proposal, you're in luck. Anyone who submits a proposal on or before Leap Day 2016 for the [openSUSE Conference](http://bit.ly/1ZPVpSn) will get an openSUSE Leap 42 T-Shirt; it can be either shipped to them or picked up at the conference. After you [submit your proposal](http://bit.ly/1o1Nn7I), don’t forget to [register for the conference](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC16/register). There is a section in the registration that allows you to select your T-Shirt size. Those you who have registered can update the registration to select your size T-Shirt. Contact [ddemaio@suse.de](mailto:ddemaio@suse.de) if you need your T-Shirt shipped to you.![]( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CZ-UpArWkAETCDH.jpg)

This year’s openSUSE Conference will also include a SaltStack Summit, Kolab Summit, SUSE Labs Summit and OwnCloud Summit, and it will be a conference you will not want to miss.


### T-Shirt Design Contest


There is more than just the Leap 42 T-Shirt. Between Leap Day and April 2, 2016, there will be a [T-Shirt Design Contest](http://bit.ly/20Prrt0) for the openSUSE Conference.

We are calling on the talent and creativity of the Open Source community to create a T-Shirt design for oSC16. The images of the T-Shirt designs should be uploaded to the wiki and linked to the "[Submit your designs](https://en.opensuse.org/OSC16tshirtcontests#Designs)" section of the [wiki page](https://en.opensuse.org/OSC16tshirtcontests).

The Organizing Team for oSC16 will select the winning design on April 5, 2016. The winner of the T-Shirt design contest will receive a T-Shirt in the mail.
