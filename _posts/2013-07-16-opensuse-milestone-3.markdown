Milestone 2 was released just a month ago and it is now time to get the newest milestone release of openSUSE. Please remember that there is only one more milestone before openSUSE starts beta testing. There is still time for you to submit your bugs and requests for the distribution to include. As it is generally with milestones the changes are not dramatic, but there are some highlights you can see next.[![M3](//news.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/M3.png)](//news.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/M3.png)

GNOME 3.9.3 (3.10 Beta)

KDE 4.10.90 (4.11 Beta)

gcc 4.7->4.8 Kernel changed to the final stable version 3.10.0.

Subversion also changed to the latest stable release accompanied by a few important changes that you can review [here](//subversion.apache.org/docs/release-notes/1.8.html). Also, Mozilla Firefox is now updated to the latest version 22. Some improvements include WebRTC is now [enabled by default](//blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2013/05/16/firefox-beta-now-includes-webrtc-on-by-default)! Meaning that anyone looking to have Firefox do more live communication through the browser, can now do so by default. We have not seen much of this in action other than the Facebook chat integration with Firefox but there should some new applications coming in the future. HTML5 audio/video playback rate can now be changed for all those looking to ditch flash.  Asm.js optimizations ([OdinMonkey](//blog.mozilla.org/luke/2013/03/21/asm-js-in-firefox-nightly/)) is now enabled for performance improvements that have been benchmarked recently [here](//www.tomshardware.com/reviews/chrome-27-firefox-21-opera-next,3534.html).

openSUSE recommends that you download the DVD for testing purposes only. It is important to remember that the changes made in this version are not meant to be in your everyday computer, but rather that you used this version for testing purposes giving the community feedback on what bugs and problems you find. You can file your bugs in our forums, or bug tracking system [bugzilla](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Submitting_bug_reports).
