The [GNU Health Project](http://health.gnu.org/) is one of many noble open-source projects and the [openSUSE Project](https://www.opensuse.org/) is pleased to announce it has donated 10 [Raspberry Pis](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) to help expand the use and development of the project on affordable [ARM](https://www.arm.com/) hardware.

GNU Health, which is a non-profit, [non-government organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization) (NGO), delivers free open-source software for health practitioners, health institutions and governments worldwide.

“Running GNU Health  on an inexpensive computer like a Raspberry Pi really brings GNU Health’s vision of freedom and equity in health care closer to reality,” said Richard Brown, chairman of the openSUSE Project. “Think of the possibilities devices like these have to improve healthcare management and patient care using GNU Health.”

Raspberry Pis are full-blown computers with a huge potential for GNU Health and the industry, said Luis Falcón, founder of the GNU Health Project. For example, they can be used in real-time monitoring of vital signs in hospital settings and retrieving information from laboratory instruments for Personal Health Records at research and academic institutions.

“The fact that they come with openSUSE and GNUHealth pre-installed on Raspberry Pi, allows for fast deployment in many different contexts,” Falcón said, referring to the Raspberry Pi being put to field use.

<!-- more -->Public Health and Primary Care involve large deployments in different scenarios with transdisciplinary teams, he said. Having the Raspberry Pi installed with GNU Health in domiciliary units (houses) can record the infrastructure and survey vector-borne diseases like Malaria, Dengue, Chikungunya, Zika and more.

GNU Health’s free software provides functionality to facilitate a [Hospital Information System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_information_system) (HIS),  Health Information System and [Electronic Medical Record](https://www.healthit.gov/providers-professionals/electronic-medical-records-emr) (EMR) management.

Family members can update their demographics information and report issues about family functionality to the social services team. The Raspberry nodes can serve as Personal Health Record for the family members and provide a means to interact with their health professionals.

“The result is that the health authorities have good demographics and epidemiological data to improve health promotion and disease prevention programs,” Falcón said. “The Raspberry Pi are independent, autonomous, affordable computers. They have the characteristics to fit the public health system. These properties will allow large scale deployments in the GNU Health Federation, in which each of them will be a unique node of the system.“

Each Raspberry box comes with the tools such as SSL, GNU Privacy Guard -GNUPG- and more to maximize the security and privacy of stored and transmitted information.

The package is available in [openSUSE Leap 42.2](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:42.2) and [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed).

A large amount of credit for GNU Health being in openSUSE is because of Axel Braun, who packaged GNU Health for openSUSE, said Ludwig Nussel, the release manager for openSUSE Leap. GNU Health is often used on older computers, and when openSUSE Leap dropped [32-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32-bit) x86 support, it made openSUSE less attractive for the project. However, the modern [64-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit_computing) platform on an affordable Raspberry Pi 3 changes the [digital ecosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_ecosystem).

Health-care management for well-funded facilities as well as those with funding challenges can benefit from the minimal cost and power consumption of GNU Health on a Raspberry Pi.

The [Ministry of Health for Jamaica](http://moh.gov.jm/) has implemented GNU Health as part of its 2014 - 2018 Health Strategic Plan, according to [Jamaican government report](http://moh.gov.jm/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/MOH_NHIS-eHealth_StrategicPlanFINAL.pdf).

GNU Health enabled computers play a critical importance in low-resource settings, with limited connectivity, which allows the recording of information during a period of days or weeks and then is synchronized and aggregated to the Health Information Systems at the Ministry of Health.

“The GNU Health Project is deeply passionate about health and health informatics,” Brown said. “A donation like these 10 Raspberry Pi will help to further the development and implementation of less expensive hardware in the healthcare field; that is certainly beneficial for any advocate of worldwide affordable health care.”

Attendees of the [Southern California Linux Expose](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/) saw first hand the Raspberry Pi 3s that were donated to the GNU Health Project.

“People loved the Raspberries,”  Falcón said. “Of course, they are an eye-catcher by themselves, but there is much more to it than just cool gadgets.”

“Having Raspberry Pi as a member of the GNU Health team, and counting the continued support from the openSUSE community, the advocates of Freedom, Social Medicine and Public Health have a lot of reasons to celebrate; and have a lot of fun too!” Falcón said.

Users of openSUSE can install GNU Health at [software.opensuse.org](https://software.opensuse.org/).
