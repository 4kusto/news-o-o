Hi all,![Future Lizard!\](http://en.opensuse.org/images/a/af/Future.png)

The last week we again received over 100 comments on the first and second part of our strategy. A few refinements came in on our description of our target users, but most of the input was on the second part about what we offer. We have again incorporated all the comments into the document and a new iteration can be found on [co-ment](https://lite.co-ment.com/text/lNPCgzeGHdV/view/).

<!-- more -->
And now, the third piece of text has been added: [What does openSUSE not do?](https://lite.co-ment.com/text/lNPCgzeGHdV/view/) Besides this, we added some 'background information' to the strategy, including ideas on our competition, what openSUSE might gain and loose from this strategy and how openSUSE should look like in 2 years from now.

Like with "Target Users" and "What does openSUSE offer it's users" we would really appreciate it if you could give your input on co-ment but we will accept any kind of input on any channel we can follow. So if co-ment isn't your thing, feel free to comment below this post, on the forums or anywhere else. For those new to [co-ment](http://www.co-ment.com/about/) - it is a pretty awesome commenting tool under the [GNU Affero GPL](http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/agpl-3.0.html).

Giving your input on [co-ment](https://lite.co-ment.com/text/lNPCgzeGHdV/view/) will make the discussion a bit more structured and easier for everyone to follow. How-to: select some text you want to comment on (a word, a few words, a sentence) and choose the little yellow + sign on the top-left of the page to add your comment. If you click a colored section of the text, you can see the comments which have been made to that section it and add your own voice to the discussion. Easy peasy!

You can find the document [here](https://lite.co-ment.com/text/lNPCgzeGHdV/view/). And for reference [here the openSUSE Strategy portal](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Strategy) on the wiki. Please have fun!

Greetings,
Your strategy team
