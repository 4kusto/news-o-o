![hexapattern](/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HeXaPattern.jpg)The [openSUSE Project](https://www.opensuse.org/) is pleased to announce the availability of the [openSUSE Leap 42.2](http://software.opensuse.org/developer/en?release=developer) Release Candidate 1 (RC1).

Since mid-May, the project has been guiding the development of the next [openSUSE community release Leap 42.2](http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=opensuse), which will be released in 29 days. The release of RC1 completes the development process for openSUSE Leap 42.2 based on source code from [SUSE Linux Enterprise](https://www.suse.com/products/server/) (SLE) Service Pack (SP) 2.

RC1 delivers a professional version that includes [OpenStack client](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OpenStackClients) software and several other software stacks developers and system administrators will find useful.

RC1 adds new bug fixes for KDE as [Plasma 5.8.1](https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.8.0-5.8.1-changelog.php) provides several commits to provide a more stable performance for KDE users. The Long-Term Support (LTS) version of [Plasma 5.8](https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.8.1.php) has several open-source users excited about the stability potential and rebirth of the KDE.

[GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) games were updated in RC1 as [five-or-more](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Five%20or%20more),  [four-in-a-row](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Four-in-a-row) and [Iagno](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Iagno) updated to the GNOME 3.20.2 version.

<!-- more -->In addition to having [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) and [KDE](https://www.kde.org/) desktop environments, the Leap version offers several other desktop environments like [Cinnamon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon_(software)), [Xfce](https://www.xfce.org/) and [more](http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=opensuse). For those looking for lightweight login / display manager, RC1 offers [LightDM 1.19.5](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/LightDM/).

The [Linux Kernel](https://kernel.org/) for openSUSE Leap 42.2 is version 4.4. RC1’s Long-Term Support Kernel updated from [version 4.4.22](https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.4.24) in the Beta 3 to 4.4.24 in the RC1, which provides some patches for ARM 64.

As an acclaimed community-enterprise distribution that focuses on stability, Leap offers developers and system administrators a professional distribution that uses hundreds of SLE SP 2 packages and thousands of community-built packages. The openSUSE Leap distribution provides developers and system administrators a release that is production ready and offers an easy migration path to move to the faster release cycles of openSUSE Tumbleweed or to an enterprise solution with SLE 12.
