The first ever [openSUSE Summit](http://summit.opensuse.org) in Asia will take place in Beihang University, Beijing on October 18th and 19th, 2014. We aim to promote the use of openSUSE and other free open source software in the region. We will have a series of talks, discussions and workshops that will induct people into the openSUSE Project. The goal of the Summit is to provide a platform for everyone to understand openSUSE so that it becomes easier to use and contribute to it. It is also a great opportunity for openSUSE contributors and users from all over Asia who have only been interacting online with each other so far, to meet face to face. And to learn about various free and open technologies, sharing experiences with each other and having a lot of fun.

So what are you waiting for? Come join us in beautiful Bejing!
