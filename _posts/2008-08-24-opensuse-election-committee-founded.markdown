We now have founded an openSUSE Election Committee consisting of:



	
  * Claes Backstrom (Community)

	
  * Andrew Wafaa (Community)

	
  * Marko Jung (Novell)

	
  * Vincent Untz (Novell, deputy)


The openSUSE election committee will organize and oversee the first openSUSE Board election, the board has authorized it to decide any open questions on the elections. Members of the committee have agreed to refrain from standing for the election to ensure a fair and impartial process.

The openSUSE board consists of four selected members (two Novell employees, two non-Novell employees) and the Novell appointed chairperson.

For details of the Board election, see [http://en.opensuse.org/Board_Election/2008](http://en.opensuse.org/Board_Election/2008).

The Election Committee will soon write their own announcements about the elections.Â  You can reach them via [election-officials@opensuse.org](mailto:election-officials@opensuse.org).

If you like to vote for the new board, please apply as member, details are available in the [wiki.](http://en.opensuse.org/Members)

On behalf of the current board, I'd like to thank the committee members for stepping up and look forward to a good election,

Andreas
