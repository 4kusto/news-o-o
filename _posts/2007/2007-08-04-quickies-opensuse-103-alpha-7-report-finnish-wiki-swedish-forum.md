Susan from [tuxmachines.org](//www.tuxmachines.org/) has been one of the most constant testers of openSUSE releases for quite some time and for openSUSE 10.3 Alpha 7 she wrote again a [detailed report with her observations](//www.tuxmachines.org/node/18763) and put up a [screenshot gallery](//www.tuxmachines.org/gallery/v/suse103a7/) showing the new artwork. The [wiki internationalization effort](//en.opensuse.org/OpenSUSE_Translation_Guide) continues, with the [Finnish Wiki](//fi.opensuse.org/) joining the existing 16 international wikis. Daniel informed us that he recently launched [suseforum.se](//www.suseforum.se), a web forum with the intention of being a gathering point for the openSUSE community in Sweden.
