KIWI-LTSP team is very happy to announce the new project on [Novell Forge](//developer.novell.com/wiki/index.php/Developer_Home). The project aims toÂ  combine the Linux Terminal Server and openSUSE KIWI imaging technologies.

[LTSP](//www.ltsp.org) offers immense benefit of being able to use obsolete/lower configuration PCs as a diskless thin clients. The thin clients can be put to any use just like normal desktops without even installing any operating system on them, for example, browse the Web, send e-mail, create documents, and run other desktop applications.

Many schools and corporates are now realizing the huge cost (TCO) advantage of using thin client computing. Thin client computing is the only way for many of the third world countries that cannot afford to purchase software licenses and new hardwares to run today's softwares.

The openSUSE KIWI Image System provides a complete operating system image solution for Linux supported hardware platforms as well as for virtualisation systems like Xen, Qemu or VMware. KIWI features distribution independent design, support for virtual systems, network deployed images, live CDs, thick clients and now with KIWI-LTSP diskless clients too.

KIWI-LTSP utilizes this ease of deployment and management provided by KIWI to bring our awesome distribution openSUSE 10.3 to everyone that wishes to use thin client computing.
