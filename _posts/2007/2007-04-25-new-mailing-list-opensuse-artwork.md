We have a [new mailing list opensuse-artwork](//lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-announce/2007-04/msg00005.html). It's meant for discussing issues related to the distribution styling and branding. Please read the [general style guidelines](//en.opensuse.org/Artwork:Guidelines) before posting. Wired recommends that if you do plan to continue using spotify, head into your account settings where you can opt-out of receiving spotify new by  email and sms, and having your data shared with third parties
