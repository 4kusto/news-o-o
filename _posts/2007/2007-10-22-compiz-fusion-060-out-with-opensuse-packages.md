The [Compiz Fusion](//compiz-fusion.org) team [announced](//lists.compiz-fusion.org/pipermail/community/2007-October/000142.html) the release of 0.6.0, the first stable release after six months of hard work from the community. The new version contains many fixes, new plugins, and many new features. As always, [Jigish Gohil](//dev.compiz-fusion.org/~cyberorg) has provided packages for openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3 (using _1-click-install_), in the [X11:XGL](//download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:/XGL/) Build Service repository. 

  
  
  




### Background



Compiz Fusion, as of openSUSE 10.3, [is included](//news.opensuse.org/?p=167) in the official OSS repository. The Compiz Fusion project is "the result of a merge between the Compiz community plugin set "Compiz Extras" and the parts of the Beryl project that are independent of the window manager core.  The two communities have re-united to create a user experience for Linux that rivals anything available on other platforms."

### What's New



For an overview of what is new in the latest release, with screenshots, take a look at [this Compiz Fusion blog](//smspillaz.wordpress.com/2007/10/21/compiz-fusion-060-is-released/). In addition to this, the openSUSE packages contain two excellent additional things to help:



#### Compiz Manager Wrapper



A new Compiz Manager wrapper script, which can ease the pain of enabling Compiz Fusion. It will launch Compiz Fusion automatically if it detects Xgl, or the hardware and drivers capable of running it. 



#### Fusion System Tray Icon



For easy-access to Compiz and decoration settings, a new _fusion-icon_ is included which will dock itself into the system tray. From here you can reload the window manager, change to another window decorator, and more:

### Install Now!



On openSUSE 10.3, you can use [1-click-install](//news.opensuse.org/?p=133) for installation of Compiz Fusion packages, simply click on the relevant link below:

[![fusion-kde-1click.png](//news.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/fusion-kde-1click.png)](//download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:/XGL/openSUSE_10.3/compiz-fusion-kde.ymp)

[![fusion-gnome-1click.png](//news.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/fusion-gnome-1click.png)](//download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:/XGL/openSUSE_10.3/compiz-fusion-gnome.ymp)

...which will install -- in addition to all the standard Compiz Fusion packages -- a KDE window decorator and a GTK window decorator respectively. The Emerald decorator is also included in both selections. For additional information check the [Compiz Fusion](//opensuse.org/Compiz_Fusion) wiki page, and optionally the [AIGLX](//opensuse.org/AIGLX) wiki page as well.
