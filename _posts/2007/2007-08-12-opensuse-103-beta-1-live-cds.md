Stephan Kulow has [created and uploaded](//lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-announce/2007-08/msg00006.html) Live CDs of the 1-CD installations for your pleasure: [GNOME Live ISO](//download.opensuse.org/distribution/10.3-Beta1/iso/cd/openSUSE-10.3-Beta1-GNOME-Live-i386.iso), [KDE Live ISO](//download.opensuse.org/distribution/10.3-Beta1/iso/cd/openSUSE-10.3-Beta1-KDE-Live-i386.iso). He writes: "_Please put 'live CD' into the summary of bug reports, so we don't confuse them  with the installation CDs. The Live CDs are still very early in development,  but we would like to hear your feedback in general._" The password for both the root and the 'linux' user is 'linux'.
