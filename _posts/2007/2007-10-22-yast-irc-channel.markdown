The [YaST team](//en.opensuse.org/YaST_Team) had last week a workshop and the participants are now updating the [openSUSE wiki](//en.opensuse.org/YaST_Workshop_Prague_2007) with their slides and comments.

Lukas announced that the YaST team is opening up their development further:

During the YaST workshop last week, the developers have decided to use the current [#yast](irc://irc.freenode.net/yast) channel on _irc.freenode.net_ as our official one. In a few days, you will be able to find most of internal YaST developers there - and we hope, more and more external as well :)

So how to talk with YaST developers online? Simply click on the link above, or:



	
  * Install some IRC client and run it...

	
  * Use these settings:

	
    * /server irc.freenode.net

	
    * /join #yast





We still don't have any "YaST IRC Client" ;) Not yet!

Besides the #yast channel, there are more that are used by the openSUSE project, for details check the[ openSUSE wiki](//en.opensuse.org/Communicate/IRC).
Have a nice day && a lot of fun!

Lukas and Andreas
