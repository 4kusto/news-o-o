At Novell we've been planning a special internal event that will run this week, from June 25th to 29th.  We're calling it [Hack Week](//lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2007-06/msg00043.html). During Hack Week, our entire Linux engineering team -- hundreds of people -- will be working on whatever Linux or open source projects interest them.  Everyone will work alone or in teams, on existing open source projects or new ideas of their own.  No one will tell them what or what not to do -- it's a free week for free hacking, driven by individual passion.
