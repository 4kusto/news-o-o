[Tomáš Chvátal](https://plus.google.com/108295121356491542380),[ Gertjan Lettink,](https://plus.google.com/105016301519408468928) and[ Bryan Lunduke](https://plus.google.com/108930697266689628917) take the helm with the existing board members of [Michal Hrušecký](https://en.opensuse.org/User:-miska-), [Kostas Koudaras](https://connect.opensuse.org/pg/profile/warlordfff) and chairman [Richard Brown](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+RichardBrownSYS/posts).

The new board members each bring different experiences and cultural backgrounds, which will no doubt provide for an exchange of ideas in fulfilling their role of representing the community and the project. The new members are from the Czech Republic, Netherlands and United States, respectively.

[Manu Gupta](https://plus.google.com/113356692914857355212) and [Efstathios Iosifidis](https://plus.google.com/116381667574498856310), who ran in this year’s elections, received several votes. Both are great members of the community and will have a chance to run in next year’s elections.

Many thanks to the departing board members [Andrew Wafaa](http://www.wafaa.eu/), [Robert Schweikert](https://en.opensuse.org/User:rjschwei) and [Bruno Friedmann;](http://lizards.opensuse.org/author/bruno_friedmann/) your efforts and time on the board are valued.

The project can not exist without its members and board, which represent the community. The board helps to resolve conflicts, facilitates decision making processes when needed and communicates with the community and project stakeholders. And yes, like the picture above suggests, occasionally slap each other in the face.

Those who make the decision to volunteer their time and efforts toward representing the project are greatly appreciated. Thank you to all future, past and present board members. Congratulations.
