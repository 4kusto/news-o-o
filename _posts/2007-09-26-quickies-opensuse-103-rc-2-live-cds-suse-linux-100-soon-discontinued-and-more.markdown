Stephan Kulow has [announced openSUSE 10.3 Live CDs](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-announce/2007-09/msg00007.html) based on Release Candidate 2 which [also got synced out](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2007-09/msg00658.html) - its live installer should still be considered Alpha. The security support for SUSE Linux 10.0 [will be discontinued](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-announce/2007-09/msg00004.html) soon, after over two years. The [openSUSE Codecs Site](http://software.opensuse.org/codecs) went online which will provide openSUSE 10.3 users with hints when they try to play unsupported formats. There is a nice user [report about Novell's presence at the recent OpenOffice.org conference](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse/2007-09/msg01585.html). Marcus Meissner did some [observations on how fragmentation can affect package manager speed](http://marcusmeissner.livejournal.com/13428.html) and added a [support database article](http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Speed_up_Package_Manager_Stack). Responding to [a distribution survey](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2007-09/msg00072.html), Pascal Bleser created [some statistics about the amount of packages](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2007-09/msg00074.html) for openSUSE.
