![Tumbleweed-black-green]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Tumbleweed-black-green-300x127.png)openSUSE users are at no loss for getting new software as this week the rolling distribution [Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) had several snapshot releases and there was a b[eta release for openSUSE Leap 42.2](https://news.opensuse.org/2016/08/31/opensuse-releases-leap-beta-modifies-road-map/).

openSUSE’s rolling distribution Tumbleweed, which was originally created by Linux kernel developer Greg Kroah-Hartman, had six snapshots two weeks ago and four last week. This week we will look at another six snapshots.

The most recent snapshot, [20160831](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-09/msg00049.html), updated seven packages. [VirtualBox ](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)updated to version 5.1.4 and Pango, a library for laying out and rendering of text, which an emphasis on internationalization updated to version 1.40.2. [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/) had several subpackages updated in version 5.2.1.2.

Users waiting for new KDE software were probably ecstatic to see KDE update all three of its projects at once in snapshot [20160830](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-08/msg00585.html). [Plasma 5.7.4](https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.7.4.php), [Applications 16.08.0](https://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-applications-16.08.0.php) and [Frameworks 5.25.0](https://www.kde.org/announcements/kde-frameworks-5.25.0.php) all came in this enormous [20160830](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-08/msg00585.html) snapshot that will have people scrolling down the list for a while to see what was updated. YaST was the other version updated in this snapshot.

Snapshot [20160822](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-08/msg00451.html) provided updates to [ceph](http://ceph.com/), [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) and YaST packages. [GTK3](http://www.gtk.org/) updated to version 3.20.9 and GNU Compiler Collection 6 update cleaned up some spec files.

Release [20160825](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-08/msg00498.html) updated the [Linux Kernel to 4.7.2](https://www.kernel.org/). Mozilla  had its first minor release for Firefox 48 and PHP updated to version 5.6.25. GNOME shell had an update to version 3.20.4 and YaST continues to fix bugs for openSUSE Leap and SUSE Linux Enterprise.

Grub2 and [Xen](https://www.xenproject.org/) had updates in the [20160826](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-08/msg00511.html) snapshot. The PDF rendering library [Poppler ](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/)updated to version 0.47 and wayland-protocols updated to 1.6, which added to two new protocols.

Snapshot [20160828](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-08/msg00540.html) had few updates, but one that was upstreamly fast in Tumbleweed. Kernel-firmware 20160824 made it into Tumbleweed four days after upstream released the firmware. GNOME Map users had an update to version 3.20.3 and disk encryption package cryptsetup updated from 1.7.0 to 1.7.2.
