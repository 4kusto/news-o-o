Last Thursday at the Meet Windows Azure party in San Francisco, attendees learned how developers can use Linux on Windows Azure. In case too much of our [Old Toad](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Beer) has impaired your memory, the [openSUSE 12.1 announcement](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/11/16/opensuse-12-1-all-green/) in November 2011 included many new innovations and tools to help developers run cutting edge Linux-based operating systems in cloud environments.

This innovation has worked really well! In fact, even [Windows Azure](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/) has taken a liking to our Linux operating system and developer tools because now you can run openSUSE on Windows Azure. The Windows Azure team apparently likes to mix our Old Toad beer with their Windows Azure Kool-Aid â€“ which we thought sounded really strange, but we don't mind another place for openSUSE to run.  <!-- more -->

We designed openSUSE 12.1 with such integration in mind, making it even versatile and extensible for supporting mixed IT environments including public and private clouds. And, developers can use [SUSE Studio](http://www.susestudio.com/) to build and deploy unique versions of openSUSE with custom package selections, artwork, scripts, etc. directly to Windows Azure in a just a few simple mouse clicks. 

Visit [this site](http://www.suse.com/suse-linux-enterprise-server-on-azure) to learn how to build and deploy openSUSE workloads onto Windows Azure.
