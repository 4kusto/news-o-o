Last week we released openSUSE 10.3, and we want to keep you updated on its very successful launch. I finally got some more numbers:

During the first 30 hours we changed the priority on our download redirector to prefer our network; these are basically the numbers of all people went to software/download.opensuse.org and not directly to a mirror. This was to help take a little load off the mirrors during the peak time.

And of course a big "thank you" to all our mirrors!
