Hi all!

Friday the 1st of October will be the deadline for requesting travel and hotel sponsorship requests for the openSUSE conference. We will notify those who will receive support next week, some have already had mail about their hotel. Please note that our budget is limited, we'd like to help those who need it most!

Greetings,
Your Friendly Conference Team
