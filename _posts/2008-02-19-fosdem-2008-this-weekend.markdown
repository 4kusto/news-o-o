This weekend (23-24.02) the openSUSE folks will again go to Brussels to one of the most important developer events in Europe:  [FOSDEM](http://www.fosdem.org/2008/).
For all openSUSE users we will again have an openSUSE devroom, which means 2 days full of interesting presentations about the openSUSE universe.
