In response to feedback from [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) users, [Leap](https://get.opensuse.org/leap/) is expecting to have regular [rebuilds of the distribution](https://openqa.opensuse.org/group_overview/88) on a quarterly or as needed basis soon. 

These respins, which rebuild the ISO image, will receive [openQA](https://openqa.opensuse.org/group_overview/88) testing and have a rhythmic release now that the [setup process](https://github.com/openSUSE/openSUSE-release-process/issues/104) is complete. 

These respins allow users to take advantage of the latest bug fixes and updates immediately, which reduces the bandwidth for online updates after an installation of the General Availability (GA) release. Amended ISO images can update packages like [GRUB](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/) and [shim](https://github.com/rhboot/shim) to improve these bootloader and firmware packages for users.

The updated ISO images, which contain [a number extension in the filename](https://build.opensuse.org/package/binaries/openSUSE:Leap:15.3:Update:Respin/000product:Leap-dvd5-dvd-aarch64/images) like 15.3-X to distinguish from the GA release, will have a different checksum than the previously released images. The old ISO image found on [get.opensuse.org](https://get.opensuse.org/) will be removed and replaced with an up-to-date respin image.

With the completion of the [setup process](https://github.com/openSUSE/openSUSE-release-process/issues/104) and initial [rebuilds](https://build.opensuse.org/package/binaries/openSUSE:Leap:15.3:Update:Respin/000product:Leap-dvd5-dvd-aarch64/images), the test results are showing little difference from the orginal GA release of [Leap 15.3](https://get.opensuse.org/leap/); the work continues and a respin will be available soon. 

Users can expect a respin of Leap after any rebuild of [SUSE Linux Enterprise](https://www.suse.com/products/server/) for similar reasons as both Leap and SLE are connected.

Similar to the [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/) blogs, each respin of Leap is expected to have an article published on [news.opensuse.org](https://news.opensuse.org/) giving people information on what the rebuild changed or fixed, which will also be available in the [changelog](http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/leap/15.3/ChangeLogs/) on [download.opensuse.org](http://download.opensuse.org/).
