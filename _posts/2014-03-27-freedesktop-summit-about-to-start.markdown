Next week, from Monday the 31st of March to the 4th of April, developers from the major Linux Desktops (GNOME, KDE, Unity and RazorQt) will meet again in Nuremberg for the second FreeDesktop Summit.

The summit is a joint technical meeting from developers working on 'desktop infrastructure' on the major Free Desktop projects and the event aims to improve collaboration between the projects by discussing specifications and the sharing of platform-level components.

Like last year, the event is supported by [SUSE](http://suse.com), which is offering the venue, the hotels and some help with organization.

Check [the report from last year](http://dot.kde.org/2013/04/17/report-freedesktop-summit) to get an idea of what this event is about.
