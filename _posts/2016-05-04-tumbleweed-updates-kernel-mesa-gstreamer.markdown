### ![Tumbleweed-black](/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Tumbleweed-black.png)Plans to update to GCC 6


After an entire full rebuild last week, [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) is shifting its focus to another area.

Tumbleweed is planning to switch the compiler to [GCC 6](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-6/changes.html), and if all goes well, according to Dominique Leuenberger, it might be available in a few weeks, but will certainly trigger another full rebuild.

For TW users waiting for [Qt 5.6](https://wiki.qt.io/New_Features_in_Qt_5.6), they will have to wait a little longer due to a bug that is holding up its release.

Less than an hour ago, [snapshot 20160503](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-05/msg00060.html) was released and it updates Mesa to version 11.2.1, virtualbox to 5.0.18, snapper to 0.3.2) and perl-Bootloader to 0.912.

<!-- more -->Perhaps a little more exciting was the [20160430 snapshot](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-05/msg00029.html), which had an enormous amount of updates. Updated versions of libzypp, libvirt, the [Linux Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/), sssd and many others were made available in this snapshot. [Gstreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/)â€™s newest stable and tested version in Tumbleweed is 1.8.0. Libreoffice updated to version 5.1.3.1. Wireshark 2.0.3 has fixes for some crash issues and gettext-runtime updated to version 0.19.7.

After a recent [YaST sprint](http://bit.ly/1rhAyHV), further developments continued as autoyast2 updated to version 3.1.125. Kiwi updated to 7.03.67 and apparmor updated to 2.10.1. The only major version update was to cpupower, which is now at 4.6 from 3.19.

Tumbleweed [snapshot 20160502](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-05/msg00043.html) updated kernel-firmware to 20160421, which provided an update firmware file for Intel Bluetooth 8265. Wine was updated twice during the past week and is now at version 1.9.9. The perl-Image-ExifTool, which had the most changes in the snapshot, updated to 10.1 5.****

GGC 5 was updated in Tumbleweed less than a year ago.
