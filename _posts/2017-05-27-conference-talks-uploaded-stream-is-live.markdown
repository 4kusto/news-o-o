This year’s openSUSE Conference has so far been a blast and the talks  from [Day 1 ](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC17/schedule)of the conference have already been uploaded to the [openSUSETV YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/opensusetv).

For the people who couldn’t make it to this year’s conference, they can watch the live stream of the conference at [http://streaming.media.ccc.de/osc17/](http://streaming.media.ccc.de/osc17/). There are two rooms (Galerie and Saal) being live streamed and recorded.

Starting out the conference, [Matthias Kirschner](https://fsfe.org/about/kirschner/kirschner.en.html), President of [Free Software Foundation Europe](https://fsfe.org/index.en.html), delivered a [terrific keynote](https://youtu.be/jMdYxmjq0Vk?list=PL_AMhvchzBacOM0DTf7pn-S_duElE9yMC) and gave several thought provoking questions about who will be the torchbearer for open-source software and questioned whether it is necessary to have a torchbearer since there are so many examples of success of open-source software.

Chief Technology Officer and co-founder of[ SaltStack](https://saltstack.com/),[ Thomas Hatch](https://saltstack.com/leadership/), gave a great keynote today and yesterday gave a talk about “[My Move to SUSE](https://youtu.be/8xsq_HFaEOA?list=PL_AMhvchzBacOM0DTf7pn-S_duElE9yMC).”

Thorsten Kukuk introduced [openSUSE Kubic](https://youtu.be/OoRZbrMziSM?list=PL_AMhvchzBacOM0DTf7pn-S_duElE9yMC) as a project under the openSUSE Project and Leap release manager Ludwig Nussel touched on the status of Leap; [past, present and future](https://youtu.be/s1v-icm2uuc?list=PL_AMhvchzBacOM0DTf7pn-S_duElE9yMC).

Another great talk recommended for system administrators and developers from the  open-source community is Wolfgang Engel’s talk about [SUSE Package Hub](https://packagehub.suse.com/) and how SUSE is bringing [community packages to enterprise users](https://youtu.be/rStv6db-1lA?list=PL_AMhvchzBacOM0DTf7pn-S_duElE9yMC).
