Frank Karlitschek will show us on Saturday at 9:30 the project he's working on to simplify the way software gets to users. Frank has deep knowledge in open source communities as member of the [KDE e.V. ](http://ev.kde.org/)Board of Directors and eg. as driver behind the [open-PC](http://open-pc.com/) project and some more activities he's doing. 

What makes developers and users happy ?
Currently developers create great software solving the user's problem. But getting the software in a consumable way, simple, fast and efficient to the user nowadays still comes with some challenges. And marketing of the software isn't covered either yet. So, maybe this situation could be improved. 
This is the first public presentation of on ongoing project to radically simplify the work for the developers and make new applications available for end users in just a few minutes.
