Well, for me and some other openSUSE guys it's T-1, we going tomorrow to set up the booth.

(actually the picture is from last year .. :-)). So why should you come to Berlin?

	
* you can meet a lot of openSUSE members

	
* we have a pretty booth with 4 counters: 2x openSUSE 11.0 beta3, Enterprise Server and [Linux-Club.de](//www.linux-club.de/) as supported community project

	
* see the ultra fast new packagemanagent and other changes in openSUSE 11.0
	
* Saturday is [openSUSE day](//en.opensuse.org/Linuxtag) with a lot of interesting talks

	
* meet [Zonker](//zonker.opensuse.org/), the openSUSE community manager

	
* Lars will present the [Education](//en.opensuse.org/Education) project

	
* get one of the new openSUSE stickers! :-)


If you have no chance to go to Berlin, don't worry. We will record all Talks, i will try to have streaming video from the booth, and you will find all Talks later on our wiki. But yes, you would miss the live feeling of [Linuxtag](//www.linuxtag.org/2008/) ...
