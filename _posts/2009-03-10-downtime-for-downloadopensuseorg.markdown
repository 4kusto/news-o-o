Peter Poeml [has reported](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-announce/2009-03/msg00008.html) that the storage array is down for download.opensuse.org. We don't have a definite time for it to be up again, but it could be more than one day. We're working on the problem and will be getting a backup in place shortly.

In the meantime, the openSUSE mirror network is still available. See [mirrors.opensuse.org](http://mirrors.opensuse.org/) to find a mirror near you.
