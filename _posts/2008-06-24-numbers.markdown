Let me share some numbers for the [openSUSE 11.0 release](//news.opensuse.org/2008/06/19/announcing-opensuse-110-gm/). Do you remember the 10.3 release? Again we used [akamai](//www.akamai.com/) for distribution of the images. Again for 30 hours, and yes, we made more than 100TB this time!

Total data transfered: **163 TB!!!**

That's without considering any other mirrors, just images downloaded directly from [software.opensuse.org](//software.opensuse.org).

Some more details:

62%  openSUSE-11.0-DVD-i386.iso 
28%  openSUSE-11.0-DVD-x86_64.iso 
3,7% openSUSE-11.0-KDE4-LiveCD-i386.iso 
2,0% openSUSE-11.0-GNOME-LiveCD-i386.iso 
1,2% openSUSE-11.0-KDE4-LiveCD-x86_64.iso 
1,1% openSUSE-11.0-Addon-Lang-i386.iso 
below 1%:
openSUSE-11.0-DVD-ppc.iso
openSUSE-11.0-GNOME-LiveCD-x86_64.iso
openSUSE-11.0-Addon-Lang-x86_64.iso
openSUSE-11.0-Addon-Lang-ppc.iso

So what are the changes compared to the [last release](//news.opensuse.org/2007/10/11/more-numbers/)?



	
  * more people downloaded the 64bit DVD (+4%)

	
  * 63% more downloads in the first 30 hours

	
  * approx. 65.000 registered installations so far, for 10.3 we had 40.000 after 6 days


For the next release we should break the 200TB mark :-)
