[![](/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0464.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0464.jpg)From retro gaming to [Linux Professional Institute exams](//www.lpi.org/linux-certifications), this year's [openSUSE Conference](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/osc15) is shaping up to be full of fun, knowledge and entertainment.


#### Security


Lock picking workshops designed to address the importance of security is one of a few security-related topics for oSC15. Security is a topic affecting people and businesses on a global scale. [Radically Open Security](https://radicallyopensecurity.com/) will do a talk about their open source business model.

#### Exams


LPI exams are confirmed to take place again at this year's oSC and although Linux Foundation exams are not confirmed yet, it is likely to be at oSC as well.


#### Entertainment


[Awesome Retro](//awesomeretro.org/) that brings the retro-gaming experience to all ages has been approached about bringing that experience to oSC15. Who's up for a game of Super Mario Kart on Super Nintendo or a game of Donkey Kong on Atari 2600?


#### Talks


Besides keynote speaker [Aaron Seigo](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Seigo), two other speakers have confirmed speeches. Markus Feilner will talk about open source and media relations and Brenno de Winter will talk about the necessity of open source software in a free society.


#### Call for papers


Submissions are steady growing and the conference is growing bigger every day, but we are making another call for papers since the deadline is just two weeks away. Submit your proposals at [https://events.opensuse.org/conference/osc15](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/osc15)

We are still looking for speakers, topics and people to participate in oSC 15. Don't forget to register for the conference at [//conference.opensuse.org](//conference.opensuse.org/).
