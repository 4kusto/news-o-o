[Masim](http://www.vavai.com/blog/) informs us that the [Indonesian openSUSE Community](http://www.opensuse.or.id)'s (OpenSUSE-ID) Annual Meeting will be held in Jakarta on 8th December 2007. This is their monthly meeting that becomes the first annual meeting to prepare the project of openSUSE-ID in 2008.

Read on for some the facts about Indonesia and the opportunity he sees to increase openSUSE and Open Source adoption.

<!-- more -->



  
  * Indonesia is made up of 17,500 islands and is the world's largest archipelagos state. It has a population of over 200 million, making it the world's fourth most populous country.

  * Indonesia has [Bali](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali), the beautiful island that become one of the 33 province in Indonesia.



Talking about the population, if we assumed that 50% of citizen are under age 15, and openSUSE is used by 1% of the rest, it's about 1 million people! This is a great thing to promote openSUSE to become the primary choice of Open Source solution.
