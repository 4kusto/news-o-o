On Saturday the 27th of November a Bug Day was organized to [solve the issue with Zombie bugs](https://news.opensuse.org/2010/11/22/opensuse-bug-day-on-saturday-november-27th/), bugs against old, non-maintained versions of openSUSE. A team got together in the [#opensuse-bug](irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-bug) channel on the [freenode network](http://freenode.net) to review the bugs for any important and still valid information, otherwise closing them to clean up [bugzilla](http://bugzilla.novell.com).

Yes, that is a full 264 bugs less! The team of about 10-15 people managed to triage more than a third (36%) of those old bugs! But they want more, and if you feel bad because you were not able to contribute, you'll have another chance to help upcoming Saturday. Another "Zombie" Bug Day will be held on December 11th.


### Join us in this effort!


Here is what you need to participate:



	
  * A recent version of [openSUSE like 11.3](http://software.opensuse.org/) or a [milestone of 11.4](http://software.opensuse.org/developer). It's of course okay to run openSUSE in a virtual machine.

	
  * An [IRC](http://www.irchelp.org/) client to interact with the other participants

	
  * Good mood :-)


But the most important thing that you should know is that everybody can help: just join us and we'll guide you, even if you only have 30 minutes of free time! A small team will organize the event by providing lists of bugs, and will be available to guide new contributors if needed. So it will be easy to help, you just have to come to the [#opensuse-bug](irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-bug) channel on the [freenode](http://freenode.net) network at Saturday!

The team had a lot of fun last time, so be sure to join them and help out!
