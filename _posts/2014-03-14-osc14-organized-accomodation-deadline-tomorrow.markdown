As you can see on the website, affordable accommodation deals have been prepared for all the Geekos visiting the [openSUSE conference 2014](https://conference.opensuse.org/). To get those low prices, bookings should be done through the supporting company [Dalmatia Aeterna](http://dalmatiaaeterna.hr/). You can contact Dalmatia Aeterna through [email](mailto:info@dalmatiaaeterna.hr) or through their [website contact form](http://dalmatiaaeterna.hr/contact/). Be sure to specify type of accommodation you want to book, arrival and departure date, for how many guests you are making a reservation. And of course, don’t forget to mention the code: “openSUSE”!

The deadline to book rooms with discounted rate is **tomorrow March 15th, 2014**. After that date bookings are available “on request” basis only. That means that after the deadline we can’t guarantee the rates listed on the site!


## The options


Take a look at the offerings, and choose something that suites you. Note that there is an additional tourist tax 1 EUR per person daily and a 20€ booking fee per person that will be charged. Prices are per person.
