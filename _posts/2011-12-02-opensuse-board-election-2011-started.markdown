The openSUSE board election just started! Please go to:
[https://connect.opensuse.org/pg/polls/read/digitaltomm/15228/opensuse-board-election-2011](https://connect.opensuse.org/pg/polls/read/digitaltomm/15228/opensuse-board-election-2011) and cast your vote for this election. All openSUSE members[1] are eligible to vote.

The board consists of 6 members and one chairperson. As the election period of Bryen Yunashko, Pavol Rusnak and Rupert Horstkotter ends, this election will appoint 3 new board members.

The election period ends at December the 16th.
All candidates have put their agenda on the wiki[2], linked as "Platform" after the candidates' name.

If you have any questions, please contact the election officials ([election-officials@opensuse.org](mailto:election-officials@opensuse.org)).

Greetings
