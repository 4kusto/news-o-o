The openSUSE Project is going [Bug Smashing on April 25](http://en.opensuse.org/BugDays/20080425), and we want you to join us! We're looking for openSUSE users and contributors who have some time to help triage YaST bugs and clean up Bugzilla.

Join us on #openSUSE-Factory from 09:00 to 18:00 CEST. We'll be going through the Bugzilla and reviewing YaST bugs to see which bugs are still valid, gathering information about existing bugs, and generally paring down the bug count to help developers focus on the most crucial problems.

Anyone can participate -- you don't have to be a developer or power user to join in, just point your browser at the [openSUSE Bugzilla](http://tinyurl.com/5yqga6), log in (be sure to create an account if you don't have one already) and start searching for bugs against YaST. Help verify bugs that are in Bugzilla, and help close bugs that have already been fixed.

Our goal for Friday is to get the YaST bug count in Bugzilla down and clear the field for YaST developers to concentrate on real bugs that need to be smashed for the openSUSE 11.0 release. You can see the current open bugs [here](http://tinyurl.com/5yqga6).

Why do we do Bug Smashing days? We want to do a couple of things. First, we want to help to train new contributors who haven't done bug reporting and triage before. By holding a Bug Smashing Day we can be ready to answer questions and provide support for new bug smashers in real time.

Second, we want to focus our attention on a specific application or feature. In this case, we want to focus on YaST and help clean up the bug database so the YaST team can concentrate on the real problems.

What do you need to participate? Just a [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.novell.com/index.cgi) account, a system with a relevant release of openSUSE, and be signed in to [#openSUSE-Factory](irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-factory).

Can't participate in the Bug Smashing days? No problem. We encourage Bugzilla cleanup all year round! See the [page](http://en.opensuse.org/Submit_a_Bug) on submitting bug reports, and join us on [#opensuse-factory](irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-factory) on Freenode.

Have questions about Bug Smashing? See the [Bug Reporting FAQ](http://en.opensuse.org/Bug_Reporting_FAQ). If your question still isn't answered, send a note to [Christoph Thiel](mailto:cthiel@suse.de) or [Joe 'Zonker' Brockmeier](mailto:zonker@opensuse.org).
