The openSUSE Conference isn™t just an opportunity to work together ” it™s also an opportunity to _play_ together. During the conference, we™ll have several  activities for attendees to get together and **have a lot of fun!**


## Conference Social Event

**Work Hard, Play Harder!** “ That will be the motto for Thursday Night. We™ll convert part of the Novell Office into _Joe™s Tavern_ and everybody from the conference is invited to join us for some ice-cold Stuff and Flaming Joe™s! The party will get going at 7PM. Food, drinks and entertainment will be provided. See the [How to get there](http://conference.opensuse.org/getting-there/) page on, guess what, how to get there. The Office is also on the [Conference Map](http://conference.opensuse.org/map/).

## Creative Commons Short Film Nights


![kommkino](http://conference.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/titelminitransp.png)**Movies free to copy and distribute.** Movies that can be shared both with friends and with the Internet community. For many that™s hard to believe, but it™s reality. Thanks to Creative Commons, which is established as both an alternative and a complement to the traditional ways of commercial distribution when it comes to media. The Creative Commons night at the KommKino Nuremberg will show that the CC-model is also working for the distribution of short films. Together with the openSUSE Conference the KommKino will show short movies and music videos licensed under Creative Commons-licenses on Friday and Saturday. Everyone who brings an USB-Stick, external harddrive or notebook will be able to take the movies home. The movies start at 9:15 PM, admission is free. The KommKino is very close to the Main Railway Station. See the [Conference Map](http://conference.opensuse.org/map/) and the [How to get there](http://conference.opensuse.org/getting-there/) page for directions.
