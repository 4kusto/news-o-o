As of today [nodejs14](https://software.opensuse.org/package/nodejs14) as well as any older nodejs versions will no longer receive updates in [openSUSE Leap 15.4](https://get.opensuse.org/leap/15.4/). Users are adviced to switch to [nodejs16](https://software.opensuse.org/package/nodejs16) instead.
