The openSUSE Project is proud to announce the launch of [forums.opensuse.org](http://forums.opensuse.org/), a merger of the openSUSE Novell support forums, suseforums.net, and suselinuxsupport.de - the three largest English-language dedicated support forums for openSUSE. The merged forums at forums.opensuse.org will provide a single forum for the openSUSE community to find support and discuss openSUSE.

The forums went live on June 9th, a result of the combined effort between the staffs of the suseforums.net, suselinuxsupport.de, and the Novell forums. The project team has been working since early 2008 to merge the forums and provide a unified forum for all English-speaking openSUSE users. The openSUSE Project will be looking at adding other languages to the forums in the very near future.

The new infrastructure is hosted by Novell to provide the highest possible quality of service, as part of Novell's support of the openSUSE Project.

The forums hosted at forums.opensuse.org are available immediately. Users with an openSUSE account for the wiki, bugzilla, and other services wil be able to use their existing username for the forums. Users of suseforums.net and suselinuxsupport.de will be able to create new accounts on forums.opensuse.org.

With the launch, the forum team won't stop working to add new features to support the openSUSE community. The merged forum is just the first step in bringing all openSUSE users and contributors better ways to communicate and support one another.

If you have questions or comments about the forums, the forums staff can be found in IRC on Freenode in the [#opensuse-forums](irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-forums) channel.
