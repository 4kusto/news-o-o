We™re proud to announce today that Jos Poortvliet will join the  openSUSE project and Novell as openSUSE Community Manager starting on  August 1. With Jos we™ve found a leader with excellent community  building experience combined with a very welcoming nature, many fresh,  promising ideas and a strong drive to grow the openSUSE Project. Jos  holds a degree in Organisational Psychology from the University of  Utrecht and has gained valuable experience in several professional roles  ranging from Project Manager at KPN to Service Level Manager at Royal  Bank of Scotland. Last but not least, Jos is a leading member of the KDE  Marketing Team and has helped Akademy and the Gran Canaria Desktop  Summit attract a vibrant and collaborative audience.

There are a great number of  interesting developments going on in the free software world, and  openSUSE plays a major role in many of them. I look forward to working  with the community on these, helping it grow, finding new directions and  ways of developing, and delivering its innovative technologies to users  and developers around the world.

We enthusiastically welcome Jos and look forward to his working with  the openSUSE community to shape the future of the openSUSE project.  After his start he will be deeply involved in the openSUSE conference,  other community events and activities, and of course he will have the  pleasure of promoting openSUSE wherever possible.
