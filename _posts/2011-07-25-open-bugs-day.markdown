The [Testing Core Team](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Testing_Core_team) is running an [Open Bugs Day](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Open-Bugs-Day).

The emphasis will be on testing whether bugs reported for older versions are still in the current milestone. They will be fixed if possible, or updated to reflect the fact that theyÂ  still exist.

All individuals interested in making the next openSUSE release be an exceptionally good release are welcome. As we get closer to the Open-Bug-Day, more specific instructions will be posted. As usual, we will have special on-line tools to help you select a bug for investigation. Coordination of the bug testing will be through the TCT's IRC channel on the Freenode IRC Network (irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-testing).

For details, check the [wiki page](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Open-Bugs-Day).
