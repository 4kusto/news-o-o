[![](https://en.opensuse.org/images/c/c1/Tumbleweed.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Tumbleweed-logo.jpeg)Here are some highlights from this week's Tumbleweed snapshot.

The default kernel has upgraded from 3.17.2 to 3.17.4 and several enhancements have been made to the Btrfs command-line tools.

AutoYaST import initializes now the correct FTP server used for configuration. The file package-manager.desktop has been moved from the package desktop-data-OpenSUSE to YaST2-packager.

Updates to the ebook management program Calibre has bugfixes and improves the search and replace function mode; a new function is able to process multiple files better while performing a Replace All.

The free open-source anti-virus software ClamAV now works with OpenSSL in FIPS compliant
mode. It supports the XDP file format and extracting, decoding, and scanning PDF files within XDP files.

DigiKam has several updates to include optional features for face detection (kface) and geotagging (kmap). Improvements for the white balance and auto-rotation of images were implemented as well.

Wine updated to a 1.7.32 development snapshot and has a new version of the Mono engine.

LXSession added the ESCAPE key to close the lxsession-logout menu and has created a lock file to prevent more than one log-out dialog.

Thai fonts have an updated version from 0.6.0 to 0.6.1 and provide a new Laksaman font.
