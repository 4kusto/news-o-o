![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Obs-logo.png)The hosting platform [cPanel](https://cpanel.com/) has provided the [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) Project with two new network cards to assist the project with its infrastructure needs.

The network cards will soon be integrated into the openSUSE infrastructure to improve the [Open Build Service](//openbuildservice.org/).

“On behalf of the openSUSE Project and the many developers and packagers who use OBS to develop open-source software, we thank cPanel for their generosity,” said Richard Brown, openSUSE Chairman. “This contribution not only helps the openSUSE project but will help other open-source projects as well.”

OBS is a generic system to build and distribute binary packages from sources in an automatic, consistent and reproducible way. It can release packages as well as updates, add-ons, appliances and entire distributions for a wide range of operating systems and hardware architectures.

"We use an internal installation of the Open Build Service, and also help customers and third parties use the public OBS at build.opensuse.org," said Ken Power, Vice President of Product Development at cPanel. "Supporting the open source projects that we use is incredibly important to us, and we're glad to be able to help here."

The network cards will be used to improve the backend of OBS.

“The cards will be used to connect the OBS backend storage and network; bringing it from a 1GB to 10BG and improving the backend performance,” said Thorsent Bro, a member of the [openSUSE Heroes](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Heroes) team. “We want to thank [cPanel ](https://cpanel.com/)for its generous support and giving back to the projects that help with Linux/GNU development.”
