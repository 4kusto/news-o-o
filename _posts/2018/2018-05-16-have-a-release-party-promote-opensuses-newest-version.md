There are just 9 days left for the release of openSUSE Leap 15 and the community can help spread the word of the release by having a release party and promoting the newest version of Leap.

Thanks to [hellcp](https://github.com/hellcp) people can decorate their blogs and website with the [openSUSE Leap 15 counter](https://github.com/openSUSE/countdown.o.o):

A list of [social media posts](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Social_media_launch_plan) are listed on the wiki and members of the community are encouraged to translate and post the translated posts in their local language on social media.

Many members of the community will be at the [openSUSE Conference](https://events.opensuse.org/) for the release/after party but the parties can continue with your own Release Party. If you don’t know how to do this, there is a list of[ five steps to have a successful release party](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Launch_party_HOWTO). Plus more details are listed below on how to have a fantastic party.

Selecting a good date and having some goodies to pass out to the party requires a bit of planning. The checklist below can help with planning the release party. If you plan on having a party, email ddemaio (at) opensuse.org well before the party to get some goodies to hand out to the party people. Please include “Leap 15 Party” in the subject line and include a mailing address and phone number.

Notify the community of your release party by listing your party on the [launch party wiki page](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Launch_parties).


## **checklist:**




#### **Find a date**


The date of a party is best during a weekend (because it’s easier for people to join, since most people work during the week), but we all function differently. Find two alternative dates for the party if you want and use[ //www.doodle.com/](//www.doodle.com/) to find a common date that works for most people.


#### **Find a place**


A cafe, bar or Linux group meetup location are all great places to have an event. A coffee and cake release party is just as fun as a beer and pizza release party.


#### **Cake**


It is not necessary to have a cake, but it sure is a lot of fun. You can also have openSUSE Cookies. On the Launch Party wiki page, there are two Release Parties list so far. One release party is in Nuremberg, Germany, on August 3 starting at 4 p.m. The other party is listed for[ FrOSCon](https://www.froscon.de/en/) and both will have a cake.


#### **Pictures, pictures, pictures**


Bring one or more cameras to take pictures or videos and post them to social media. Tag openSUSE on the photos you post on[ Twitter](https://twitter.com/?lang=en),[ Google +](https://www.google.com/),[ Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) or[ Diaspora.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora)


#### **Swag**


PromoDVDs, webcam covers and stickers – If we can get it to you without too much red tape from governments, we will; just email ddemaio (at) opensuse.org with Release Party.

IMPORTANT TIP: Schedule your[ release party](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Launch_parties) on the wiki and have a lot of fun!
