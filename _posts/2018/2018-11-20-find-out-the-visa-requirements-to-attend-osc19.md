![](/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/oSC19-logo-with-name.png)For people planning on attending the[ openSUSE Conference](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC18) 2019 in Nuremberg, Germany, from May 24 – 26, there are certain requirements necessary to receive a visa for those who are not a citizen of a Schengen country.

It’s a good idea to start thinking about getting your visa and this post summarizes the requirements.

Please note: the [Travel Support Program](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Travel_Support_Program) has no provisions to cover the cost of a visa, so it’s the travelers responsibility for covering the additional cost.

For citizens who are not a citizen of a Schengen country, you may need a formal invitation letter that fully explains the nature of your visit.

An overview of visa requirements/exemptions for entry into the Federal Republic of Germany can be found at the [Federal Foreign Office website](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/einreiseundaufenthalt/visabestimmungen-node/staatenlistevisumpflicht-node).
