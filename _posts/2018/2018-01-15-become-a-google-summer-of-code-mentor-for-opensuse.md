![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/GSoC.png/220px-GSoC.png)The  application period for organizations wanting to participate in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is now and the [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) project is once again looking for mentors who are willing to put forth projects to mentor GSoC students.

People interested in submitting a project for GSoC as part of an openSUSE mentors team can submit it to [https://github.com/openSUSE/mentoring/issues](https://github.com/openSUSE/mentoring/issues). The submissions will be reflected on [openSUSE 101](//101.opensuse.org/) and submitted as part of a mentorship package to the official [GSoC website](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/).

“If you have a new project for this year, please open a new issue for each project immediately and label it accordingly,” said Christian Bruckmayer, an [openSUSE mentor](//101.opensuse.org/). “If you have a potential project, please email us ASAP."

The deadline is Jan. 23 to submit the full package for GSoC, Bruckmayer said.

The full timeline of GSoC can found here at [https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline).

GSoC is an international program that matches mentors and students and funded 1,315 student projects last year for [201 open source organizations](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/). Last year, five students participated in GSoC under the openSUSE organizing team.

GSoC students, mentors and projects benefit from the active involvement of new mentors.  Many previous GSoC students later become mentors in the GSoC.

Email the mentors team at [gsoc-mentors@opensuse.org](mailto:gsoc-mentors@opensuse.org).
