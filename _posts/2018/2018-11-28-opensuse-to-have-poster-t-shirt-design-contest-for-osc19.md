![](/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/oSC19-logo-with-name-1.png)openSUSE will have a t-shirt image and poster design contest for the [openSUSE Conference 2019](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC19). Both contests are separate contests and have to meet certain requirements. Designers are encouraged to use open-source graphic editing software like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) or [Krita. ](https://krita.org)


Design submitted should be licensed under [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) and allow everyone to use it without attribution. Design submitted must be original and should not include any third party materials conflicting with [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) with the attribution exception.




#### The poster design contest has the following requirements:





 	
  1. The poster design must be designed for a DIN-A2-size poster. The size of the poster is (width X height) 420 x 594 mm and should include a 2 mm margin on all sides.

 	
  2. Posters should include the openSUSE Conference name, the date (May 24 - 26) and the location (Nuremberg, Germany) of the conference.

 	
  3. The poster design must be an .svg, .png or .pdf format.

 	
  4. The poster needs to be emailed to ddemaio (@) opensuse.org.

 	
  5. The posters should be added to the Poster contest [wiki page](https://en.opensuse.org/PosterSC19) as a .png so people can view the design.
