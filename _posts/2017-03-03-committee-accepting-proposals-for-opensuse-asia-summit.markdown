The openSUSE.Asia Summit is the largest annual openSUSE conference in Asia and is attended by contributors and enthusiasts from all over Asia.

The event focuses primarily on the openSUSE distribution and its applications for personal and enterprise use. It brings together the openSUSE community in Asia to provide a forum for users, developers, foundation leaders, governments and businesses to discuss the present technology and future developments.


### **Past Summits**


The last openSUSE.Asia Summit was in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, in 2016. The Summit’s preference is to find new locations each year as we spread openSUSE throughout Asia, and we are looking for local organizers to rise to the challenge of organizing an excellent openSUSE event. We need individuals and communities to get together and organize a successful openSUSE.Asia Summit. The openSUSE.Asia organization committee assists throughout the  process. You can learn more about openSUSE.Asia Summit at the following web sites:

### **Proposals for openSUSE.Asia Summit 2017**


<!-- more -->For those of you who are interested in hosting the next openSUSE.Asia Summit in 2017, you are invited to submit a formal proposal to the openSUSE.Asia organization committee. The deadlines for the proposals are as the following:
