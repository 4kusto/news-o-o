After quite a few rebuilds and testing, the openSUSE team is happy to announce that RC1 looks brilliant and is now available for download. We consider this release to be feature complete, stable, and suitable for testing from any user. For more information on the release schedule, take a look at the [Roadmap](http://en.opensuse.org/Roadmap/10.3).

## Most Annoying Bugs


* Online update opens an annoying popup with the progress. We'll prepare an online update for it, so it will only affect the first update ([Bug #326247](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=326247))
* On some machines we have problems with the kernel and ACPI - investigating, more data would be helpful
* GNOME is not yet final - we will update this right after RC1 and prepare a RC2. This one will be made internally, but you can get the update through Factory
* 32bit PPC machines have a problem with dependencies that try to install 64bit RPMs.

We'll keep [Bugs:Most_Annoying_Bugs_10.3_dev](http://en.opensuse.org/Bugs:Most_Annoying_Bugs_10.3_dev) updated as we go.


## Call for Testing


If you want to help testing our standard test cases, please coordinate with others and subscribe to [opensuse-testing@opensuse.org](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-testing/) ([subscribe](mailto:opensuse-testing+subscribe@opensuse.org))!

There is no focus area, so please use the product and file bug reports as if it was final and you wanted to use it for real.

Please note that the live CDs will contain an installer, but that installer is still under development, so you can test it, but be more careful than with the normal install.
