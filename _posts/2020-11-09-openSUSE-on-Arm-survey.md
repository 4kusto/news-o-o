The openSUSE release team [openSUSE Project](https://www.opensuse.org) has established a [survey](https://survey.opensuse.org/) to gain greater insights into the use cases of people using or developing for ARMv6, ARMv7 and ARMv8. 

The introduction to the [survey](https://survey.opensuse.org/) explains that ARMv7 architecture is currently being challenged by the new [Jump](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:15.3) development model of [openSUSE Leap](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Leap). 

The [Jump](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:15.3) process looks to use pre-built binaries from the corresponding [SUSE Linux Enterprise](https://www.suse.com/products/server/) release. 

“Previously openSUSE Leap was sharing the distribution package sources with SUSE Linux Enterprise, but built them separately,” according to the introduction of the [survey](https://survey.opensuse.org/). “As SLE stopped supporting 32-bit distributions many years ago, we have the option of continuing to rebuild the packages for openSUSE Leap on those architectures from sources, or to stop supporting those.

"We would like to understand our openSUSE ARM contributors and openSUSE ARM user base before taking any further steps. We really value your time, we don't expect you to spend more than 10 minutes on this survey."
 
The outcome of the survey will be:
* __either__ continue supporting _openSUSE Leap_ on __ARMv7__ in future releases (15.3 and beyond)
* __or__ that __ARMv7__ remains an _openSUSE Tumbleweed_ only option.

The 64-bit flavor (aarch64) is not part of this issue.

The [survey](https://survey.opensuse.org/) has seven questions and is anonymous, but gives the option to list an email if a person is interested in being contacted by the developers. The survey ends on _Nov 20th November 23:59_. So, please go to [survey.opensuse.org](https://survey.opensuse.org/index.php/125963) to fill it!

Thank you!

_The openSUSE release team_
