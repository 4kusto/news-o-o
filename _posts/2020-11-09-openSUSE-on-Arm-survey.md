Hello openSUSE ARM users!

__ARMv7__ architecture is currently being challenged by the new "Jump" development model of openSUSE Leap. This new "Jump" process will use pre-built binaries from the corresponding SUSE Linux Enterprise release. Previously openSUSE Leap was sharing the distribution package sources with SUSE Linux Enterprise, but built them separately. As SLE stopped supporting 32-bit distributions many years ago, we have the option of continuing to rebuild the packages for openSUSE Leap on those architectures from sources, or to stop supporting those.

We would like to understand our openSUSE ARM contributors and openSUSE ARM user base before taking any further steps.

We really value your time, we don't expect you to spend more than 10 minutes on this survey. 
The outcome of the survey will be that we:
* __either__ continue supporting _openSUSE Leap_ on __ARMv7__ in future releases (15.3 and beyond)
* __or__ that __ARMv7__ remains an _openSUSE Tumbleweed_ only option.

The 64-bit flavor (aarch64) is not part of this issue.

The survey ends on _Nov 20th November 23:59_. So, please go to [survey.opensuse.org](https://survey.opensuse.org/index.php/125963) to fill it!

Thank you!

_The openSUSE release team_
