Today we started an openSUSE Build Service Webclient [online survey](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=d4ovT179sAK_2f1gmuApBAjg_3d_3d). We want to get more informations about the openSUSE Build Service Webclient users, the used hard and software and (potential) use cases.

If you use, used or want to use the OBS, please participate on the survey and help us to make a solid Webclient 2.

The [survey](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=d4ovT179sAK_2f1gmuApBAjg_3d_3d) is available via this [link](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=d4ovT179sAK_2f1gmuApBAjg_3d_3d).

Thanks for your participation!
