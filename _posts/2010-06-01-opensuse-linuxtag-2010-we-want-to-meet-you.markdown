openSUSE -  as usual - will be at [LinuxTag](http://www.linuxtag.org/2010/). We have booth #203 in hall 7.2a and will show there the openSUSE Build Service 2.0 [release](http://news.opensuse.org/2010/05/25/obs-2-0b1/) which is scheduled for June 11 and how you can benefit from it and of course the last milestone of [openSUSE 11.3](http://wiki.opensuse.org/Product_highlights_11.3). We'd like to see you there and have a chat. If you want to help us at the booth please add your name and the date you want to be there at the bottom of our LinuxTag [page](http://en.opensuse.org/Linuxtag)
