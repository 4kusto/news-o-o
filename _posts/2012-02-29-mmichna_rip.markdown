[![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/mmichna_geeko.jpg)](https://news.opensuse.org/2012/02/29/mmichna_rip/mmichna_geeko/)Our fellow and long time openSUSE contributor Marco "daemon" Michna has passed away last week.

He was a friend to many of us, and will be sorely missed.

Our condolences and sympathy go out to his family and friends.

Daemon, dear friend, rest in peace.
