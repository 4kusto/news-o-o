We just switched to the new wiki. So here it is. And now? Let me explain what you can do to help!


### Create your user page


Every user of the wiki has a personal page and we did not transfer any of them. We wanted to use this opportunity to brush them up and standardize them. Your userpage should be your first task in the new wiki. If your username is Geeko, just go to [http://en.opensuse.org/User:Geeko](http://en.opensuse.org/User:Geeko) and press **"create"**.Â  After that load the userpage teamplate by pressing on the** "Load" **button. Then fill out the form and you will get a nice standardized userpage!

You can also of course transfer your old userpage. Just go to http://old-en.opensuse.org/User:Geeko to find the content.


### Report Missing Pages


Can't find your page? Think we missed something? Just report the page to the [opensuse wiki team](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Wiki_team)! We will try our best to help you getting it back!


### Transfer Missing Pages


Want to get your hands dirty? Dive right into the new wiki and learn how it works on the [Wiki Portal](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Wiki) or the previous posts on [this blog](https://news.opensuse.org/category/wiki-2/).  After you did that and know all the new wiki Kung-fu you go and find the pages you think are missing on [http://old-en.opensuse.org](http://old-en.opensuse.org). Now you have two options, either use the[ Special:Export](http://old-en.opensuse.org/Special:Export) page on the old wiki and the [Special:Import](http://en.opensuse.org/Special:Import) on the new wiki if you want to transfer the article with all of its history or you just copy and paste the article if the history is not that important.


Otherwise just
