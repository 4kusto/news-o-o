Its again the time of the year, when we have started preparing for the openSUSE Conference and we are looking for an exciting conference with more fun and energy than ever. Free software evangelists, developers, artists, writers and people from every professional and ethnic background to discuss about openSUSE and other interesting projects that are on going in the FOSS world. This year openSUSE Conference will take place along with SUSE Labs Conference.

This year we have come up with a rather interesting theme rwx3, from the Unix Acronym "Read, Write, Execute" three thime for you, the community and the world. This year we'll be shifting our attention a bit deeper, aiming for  hands-on discussions to get work done. Smaller, more focused meetings  with a strong "read-write-execute" attitude are at the core of the openSUSE  Conference 2011.
