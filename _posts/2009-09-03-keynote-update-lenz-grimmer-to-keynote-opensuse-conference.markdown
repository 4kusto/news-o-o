The openSUSE Project is happy to announce that Lenz Grimmer will be delivering the opening keynote for the first-ever [openSUSE Conference](http://conference.opensuse.org/). The openSUSE Conference will be held September 17 through September 20 in NÃ¼rnberg, Germany. [Register today!](http://conference.opensuse.org/registration/)





Grimmer's keynote, "Working in a Virtual Community," This session will talk about the pros and cons of working in a virtual organization, some proven best practices and tools, and how everyone can benefit from this working environment. Grimmer will discuss how to build trust, passion, and self-motivation, and how communities can work in distributed environments.





Leslie Hawthorn, Google's Program Manager for open source, was originally scheduled to deliver the opening keynote. Due to a schedule conflict, Hawthorn won't be able to attend the openSUSE Conference. She sends her regrets and hopes to attend an openSUSE event in the near future.





Our closing keynote will be delivered by Gianugo Rabellino, Chief Executive Officer of [Sourcesense](http://www.sourcesense.com/en/home) and member of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF).





The openSUSE Conference is an opportunity for openSUSE contributors to attend talks, workshops, Birds of a Feather sessions, and collaborate together face to face. The conference will be held from September 17 through September 20 in NÃ¼rnberg, Germany. [Register today](http://conference.opensuse.org/registration/) to reserve your spot!



The conference will have two daily tracks of pre-planned talks, plus "[BarCamp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp)" style tracks for attendees to plan and provide their own content. Scheduled talks include:






    
  * Insights into openSUSE Infrastructure: Klaas Freitag

    
  * News from the GNOME Zoo: Vincent Untz

    
  * Samba @ openSUSE: Lars MÃ¼ller





## Unconference





The openSUSE Conference will also have a major "unconference" component, where talks and sessions can be scheduled in BarCamp format. We'll have plenty of time for contributors to discuss and work on topics they're interested in face to face.





Unconference planning is being done on the [openSUSE wiki](http://en.opensuse.org/OpenSUSE_Conf_2009_Unconference). Want to lead a session? Jump in and edit the wiki!
