The next openSUSE Project meeting will take place Wednesday June 17th at 12:00 UTC. See all time zones on the [Fixed Time World Clock](http://is.gd/13MLI). As always, the meeting will be held in IRC on the [#opensuse-project](irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-project) channel on Freenode.

Please add your topics to the meeting wiki page at:

Please add topics as soon as possible. Also, if you have questions for the meeting, but can't attend (we know that the meeting times can't work for everyone) please add them to the agenda as well.
