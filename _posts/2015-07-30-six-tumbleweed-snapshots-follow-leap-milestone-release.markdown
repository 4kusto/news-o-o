[![LibreOffice 5.0 is expected soon in openSUSE Tumbleweed.](https://blog.documentfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tdf-roadtolo50.png)](https://blog.documentfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tdf-roadtolo50.png)

openSUSE’s rolling release Tumbleweed posted six snapshot updates this past week following the release of Leap’s first milestone.

The only day a snapshot was not posted was on Sunday, so quite a few updates made it onto users’ computers this past week.

Tumbleweed followed the release of the Leap milestone by updating the Linux Kernel to 4.1.3, which is the latest stable version. Oracle’s VirtualBox was updated to 5.0.0 from 4.3.28.

There was an update to the YaST spec for the 20150727 snapshot. GNOME had some minor updates that fixed a crash when reading invalid backlight values. KDE had some minor updates as well and some Plasma 5 addons.

AppArmor updated to 2.10 and received several development updates. The cache time stamp issue was fixed and several memory leak/crashes bugs were fixed for libapparmor.

There was a fix for systemd on Xen and python-sip updated.

LibreOffice 5.0 is approaching soon, according to its roadmap and should make it into Tumbleweed soon, while perl and xfce still need to be fixed before being released in a Tumbleweed snapshot.
