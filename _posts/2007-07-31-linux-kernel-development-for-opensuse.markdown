We have a new mailing list: opensuse-kernel (subscribe via [lists.opensuse.org](http://lists.opensuse.org/)).

This list is dedicated to the discussion of the openSUSE kernel development (Factory et al) and the kernels in the openSUSE Build Service. Packaging or openSUSE-specific patches (though hopefully rare and growing more so) are on-topic; general Linux kernel development is best served by the existing public lists (LKML et al).
