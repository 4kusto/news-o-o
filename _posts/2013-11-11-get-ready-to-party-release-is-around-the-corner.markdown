[![release is coming](//news.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/release-is-coming-header.png)](http://www.opensuse.org/Portal:13.1)In just a little over a week, openSUSE 13.1 will be released! As we've all put in serious work to make this happen, it is certainly a good cause for celebration. Time to organize Launch Parties!


## Launch Parties


A launch parties are to celebrate an openSUSE release. To start with the celebration part, as we all enjoy hanging out with fellow geekos, just having a space where you can talk and perhaps drink a beverage of choice should do the trick just fine. Of course, conversation starts easier if there is a subject to discuss - and that is where the release comes in! By the time the release is out, there is plenty of information on the [openSUSE 13.1 Portal page](https://www.opensuse.org/Portal:13.1) that can be discussed.

Release parties are part of openSUSE. That means: they should be open, cool and featuring lots of fun! That doesn't mean just following a '_code of conduct_', no, it means **going out to people and being inviting**! We're all geekos, we're all the same and we're in this together, so we're all responsible for each others fun.

## Organizing


Organizing a release party requires the following three simple steps:



1. Find a space. Simple is good: perhaps a room in your university, office or a cafe or restaurant.
2. Register your launchparty [on this wiki page](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Launch_parties)
3. Invite people: create a facebook and G+ event page, and send a mail to [relevant mailing lists](http://lists.opensuse.org/)

- like your local translation list or the project list... A blog can be helpful, too.

Finally, Have a lot of fun! Welcome every new geeko and remind them that we're all here for fun: talk to everybody you don't know first! Perhaps a quick presentation on what is new is nice but not mandatory. Just remember: people are what makes openSUSE, so bringing them together is all that really counts.

See [this how-to](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Launch_party_HOWTO) for more info and tips!

If you want to party on the release date, consider joining our [G+ release day hangout](https://plus.google.com/events/c41ppnm1vm0l29d9mdt27kqtdj4)!
