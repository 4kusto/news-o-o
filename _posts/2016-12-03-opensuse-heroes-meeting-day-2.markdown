After a long, but exciting first day, we even managed to get some sleep before we started again and discussed the whole morning about our [policies](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Infrastructure_policy) and other stuff that is now updated in the [openSUSE wiki](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Heroes). After that, we went out for a nice lunch...

...before we started the discussion about some other topics on our list.

<!-- more -->

Namely:



 	
  * we got an agreement how we manage our "own" packages (that you can find now in the [openSUSE:Infrastructure](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/openSUSE:infrastructure) project in the openSUSE Build Service) and JeOS images.

 	
  * Lars gave a short update about the current sponsoring status and possibilities

 	
  * After a freeIPA presentation from Darix and a general Cloud introduction from Christian, we started a long and interesting discussion about our services, their "distribution" between Nuremberg and Provo and how to get them connected and administrated.

 	
  * A lot of stuff around "securing our infrastructure" was not officially on the plate, but if you listened between the lines, you noticed that our admins have a secure environment always in mind - even if the topics is officially around bare metal machine administration, Salt or authentication (just to name some examples).

We ended up in a short discussion about "how do we monitor all that stuff" - and if we might use Salt also for intrusion detection. Even if we finally end up on the [Nuremberg Christmas Market](http://www.christkindlesmarkt.de/en/) this evening: be sure that we will continue the discussions about "Crowbar", "SDN", "Thruk", "GitLab", .... (at least until we got enough hot spiced wine ;-)
