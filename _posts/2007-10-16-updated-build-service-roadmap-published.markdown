An [updated Roadmap](http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service/Roadmap) for the [openSUSE Build Service](http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service) has been published. It outlines the development targets until the fourth quarter of 2008. Please understand the dates as target estimations, but not as guaranteed dates. Some functionality might arrive earlier, while other features may need some more time. 

We are also to happy to help anyone to start working on any of these functionalities, if you would like to see it earlier available. Please drop a mail in that case to the [opensuse-buildservice mailing list](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-buildservice/) ([subscribe](mailto:opensuse-buildservice%2Bsubscribe@opensuse.org)).
