In order to optimize the YaST partitioner module for openSUSE users the [user experience](http://en.opensuse.org/UX) [team](http://en.opensuse.org/UX_Team) [decided](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-announce/2008-05/msg00001.html) to conduct a small survey to figure out how you deal with hard disk configuration. The survey contains some basic questions and its results will directly influence the redesign for the partitioner module.

You can access the survey [here](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=lnZcsBO6PqJ9hjNW01jiyQ_3d_3d).

The survey will be online until 28th May 2008 and the results will be published on openSUSE.org as soon as possible.

Answering the questions will take less than five minutes.

Thank you for your participation and have a lot of fun!
