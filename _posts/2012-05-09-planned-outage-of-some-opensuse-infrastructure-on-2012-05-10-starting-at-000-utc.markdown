Our Provo data center will take down a few server starting today at 6pm local time (MDT) which is 10th of May, 0:00 UTC. The downtime is expected to last for three hours.

The following openSUSE services might be effected:



	
  * all openSUSE wiki instances, e.g. en.opensuse.org

	
  * the wordpress instances like news.opensuse.org and lizards.opensuse.org

	
  * the forums at forums.opensuse.org
