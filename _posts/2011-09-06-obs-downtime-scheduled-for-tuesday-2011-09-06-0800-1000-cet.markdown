The OBS-Team is going to replace some backend servers on next Tuesday.

Therefore, a downtime is scheduled from **08:00 to 11:00 CEST**, altough we believe it won't take that long (but you never know) :-)

Afterwards, the OBS should be prepared for all the awesome packager workshops happening during the openSUSE Conference.
