[![Tumbleweed]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Tumbleweed-300x300.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Tumbleweed.png)During the past week, Tumbleweed had three snapshots and two packages updated to major versions.

Perl’s update to version 5.22 in the [20150828 snapshot](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2015-08/msg00746.html) was perhaps the biggest news for TW this week, which was evident in the [tread](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2015-08/threads4.html) that followed the snapshot release.

The libinput library that handles input devices in [Wayland](http://wayland.freedesktop.org/) compositors and generic [X.Org](http://x.org/) input drivers upgraded to its first major version in the 20150828 snapshot, which moved from version 0.21 to 1.0. Python-cryptography was another version that updated to version 1.0, which was previously 0.9.3.

In the [20150829 snapshot](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2015-08/msg00766.html), LibreOffice updated to version 5.0.1.2 and worth mentioning is ExifTool, which is for reading, writing, and manipulating image, audio, and video [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata), updated to version 10.

In the latest snapshot [20150831](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2015-09/msg00043.html), the application security tool AppArmor updated to version 20150828.

Users anticipating the release of [Plasma 5.4](https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.3.95.php) will have to wait a little longer; KDE’s newest version is in openSUSE Factory and progress is being made, but there are some tweaks that need to be made before it is released in a TW snapshot.


#### The 5.4 version is also expected to be released in openSUSE Leap, which will have its Milestone 2 release tomorrow.
