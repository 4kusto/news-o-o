Continuing the great work of our Ambassadors of the Southern Hemisphere, our Brazilian openSUSE team once again gets ready for a strong openSUSE presence in Brazil beginning today at [FISL 12-Software Livre in beautiful Porto Alegre](http://softwarelivre.org/fisl12).Â  A major FOSS event in South America, FISL 12 is expecting 8,000 attendees this year.

The openSUSE Brazilian Ambassador team has been making strong inroads introducing not just our distro but also our many[![FISL 12 Logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/FISL12.png)](http://softwarelivre.org/fisl12) Project offerings, such as the [Open Build Service](http://buildservice.org), [SUSE Studio](http://susestudio.com), and [Edu-L-Ife](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e).Â  openSUSE has played such an important role from the classroom to the corporate offices across the country and most importantly, building community within Brazil.

So, if you just happen to be in the Porto Alegre area (or heck, if you feel the urge to jump on a plane from anywhere in the world right now) hop on down to FISL 12 and stop by the openSUSE Booth.Â  The team will be in force and will be ready to answer all your questions about openSUSE and give you free LiveDVDs.Â Â Â  You can also catch them throughout the event giving talks on OBS, Edu-L-Ife, giving general updates about the latest in the openSUSE Project.Â Â  And you won't want to miss the openSUSE Community Meeting where you get to express your views and support for openSUSE.

It's definitely an event you won't want to miss, and it's all happening right there in Porto Alegre.Â Â  So stop by as soon as you can.
