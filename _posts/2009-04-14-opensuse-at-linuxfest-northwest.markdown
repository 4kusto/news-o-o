Join the openSUSE Project as we celebrate the 10th anniversary of LinuxFest Northwest! The openSUSE Project will be exhibiting at [LinuxFest Northwest](http://linuxfestnorthwest.org/) on April 25th and 26th.

The LFNW organizers are going all out to celebrate a decade of gathering the Linux community. Featured speakers at LFNW this year include Jon 'maddog' Hall, Monty Widenius, Allison Randal, and many others from the FOSS community.

In a rough economy, you don't get more value than LFNW. The show is free to attend, and no registration is required. [Directions are available on the LFNW site](http://www.btc.ctc.edu/Welcome/CampusDirectory.html).

Need a ride to Bellingham from Seattle or nearby? The LFNW site has a [wiki page](http://wiki.gslug.org/index.php/LFNW_Ride_Share) for ride shares. If you're looking to give or get a ride, sign up on the wiki.
