As Thomas just announced on the project [mailing list](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2009-11/msg00074.html) the election committee has decided to extend the period for announcing candidacy by one week to November 30. Same applies to request openSUSE membership status which makes you eligible to vote. With this change the period for candidates to campaign gets shortened by one week to start just one week prior to opening of the ballots. Start date of the election stays Tuesday December 8.

So now it's up to you to [announce](http://en.opensuse.org/Board_Election/2009#Phase_0:_Notification_of_Intent_to_Run) your candidacy or just [request membership](http://en.opensuse.org/Members) ;-)

Have a lot of fun!
