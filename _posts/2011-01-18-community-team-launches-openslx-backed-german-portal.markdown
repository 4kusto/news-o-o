title: "Community team launches openSLX-backed German portal"
---
Board has requested to not release this.


A team of openSUSE community members, supported by openSLX GmbH, has been working ferociously in the last 6 months on a huge endavour: the creation of a brand new German community portal. In 2009/2010, open-slx GmbH already has been involved in the re-organization of the English openSUSE Wiki in order to enhance both its quality standards and usability. It has been a major strategic goal for them to provide reliable support and documentation resources to the openSUSE Project while enhancing the collaboration between forums and wiki ecosystems.

During this process it became clear that while the German openSUSE Community still is the largest local user community of the openSUSE distribution, some felt its needs are met rather poorly as part of the  globally oriented openSUSE Project.

Obviously the current wiki, while not perfect, IS a great resource of information about openSUSE and the wiki team has done some amazing work. Still, documentation and support resources are translated instead of original content which doesn't always give the best possible results. Neither does the mostly translating work engage the German community and push it to fully realize its own potential as a strong local openSUSE community providing quality resources.


## another solution


After a detailed market analysis  by openSLX and some community members the German Ubuntu Community Portalat ubuntuusers.de was identified as a very successful example of a local community providing comprehensive resources to its users.

A collaborative effort was set up between ubuntuusers.de, several openSUSE community members and open-slx GmbH to build up a new German openSUSE community portal. The portal offers an integrated concept, bringing forum, wiki and newsportal together, lowering the barrier to contribution. Much content from ubuntuusers.de has been adapted to openSUSE so there is a significant body of knowledge available as a kickstart. The new Community Portal aims to be independent but not isolated from the international community; a team of community members active in both the international and local communities aim to act as interface, exchanging ideas and information. Their goal is to provide a reasonable companion to the globally oriented openSUSE Project  infrastructure while explicitly focusing on German end-user community needs in local language.


## Status


Today the team is ready to launch the Portal and give it to the people it belongs to.

Major forum categories have been established, the planet has started to aggregate blogs of German Community contributors. 500 articles have been adapted to openSUSE but there is another 1500 wiki articles in the queue and they certainly still need a lot of help to get on par with ubuntuusers.de! Moreover, further work is needed on theming (making it more green!) and integration in the openSUSE infrastructure. We hope that both the new official German openSUSE Community Portal and ubuntuusers.de will profit from the collaboration by exchanging content and expertise.

Without any further introduction, the new German openSUSE Community Portal is currently vailable at [community.open-slx.de](http://community.open-slx.de/). openSLX has expressed their wish to move this to an openSUSE domain if the community would like that. If you are interested in getting involved, you can go to the Portal and start working or get in contact with portal developers and contributors at #open-slx on irc.freenode.net!
