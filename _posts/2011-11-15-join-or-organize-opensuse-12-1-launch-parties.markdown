Find the date, time and locations on [this page](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Launch_parties) and again, if you have not added your party yet - you know who you are - do so quickly!



## Organize your own


It is definitely not too late to organize your own release party - just find a nice cafe or an office and invite people! You can invite them below, add you party to the wiki, ask some friends & family and tweet & facebook it on the openSUSE pages! It'll be fun, we guarantee.



### Giving a presentation


Note that we have **presentations ready to go** for you! You can find more information and downloads on [this page](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Presentations#openSUSE_12.1).



### Getting cool stuffâ„¢


It's always nice to have some things to give away at a release  party. The openSUSE marketing team has plenty of cool stuff like stickers,  flyers, DVD's and t-shirts we can send to you! You could do a little  lottery or give away some things to long-time local openSUSE  contributors and the DVD's and flyers you can give to people to hand out  to their friends and family. If you're looking for some more tips on how to organize a party, [check the party how-to](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Launch_party_HOWTO)!

If you want to organize a release party and get stuff, [add your party to the wiki page](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Launch_parties) and _order the materials_ via [this website](http://software.opensuse.org/promodvd). Note clearly in the description that you want stuff for a release party so we prioritize your request!!!

Count on _at least 2 weeks_ shipping and handling time in Europe and the USA, _3-4 weeks_ in the rest of the world.



## Have a lot of fun!


We've said it before and we'll keep saying it: the most important thing is to **have a lot of fun!**

We are doing awesome stuff, and we should celebrate that sometimes!
