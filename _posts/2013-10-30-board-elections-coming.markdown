The end of the year is approaching. And besides Santa and fireworks, Geekos know: the openSUSE board gets a refresh! The openSUSE Election Committee has announced the time line for this year's elections and asked candidates to step forward for the job!


## Elections


This year, 4 seats are to be elected, two for a two year term and two for a 1 year term. As always, all [openSUSE members](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Members) are eligible to vote. Anybody contributing to openSUSE over a longer period of time can become a member - if you're not a member yet, you should [apply and get your vote in](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Membership_officials#Process)!

Anybody can step up to be on the board, as long as they are openSUSE Members (and not a member of the Election Committee). You can announce your candidacy by emailing the [openSUSE Project mailing list](//lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/) AND the [Election Committee](mailto:election-officials@opensuse.org), best with a short introduction about yourself and information on why people should vote for you.


## Role of the board


As board member, you're a central point of contact for openSUSE. SUSE talks to you about what they're up to but also people in the project itself will come to the board with issues, conflicts or wishes. The board handles the regular project meetings on IRC (and once a year at the openSUSE conference) as well as trademark issues. The board works with teams like the Travel Support Team and the Marketing team, where travel- and material budgets are involved as well. Find some information about current and past board members [on the wiki](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board).


## Time line for the elections


For these elections, this is the time line:



	
  * 28.10. Start of standing up for candidacy, nominating candidates, apply for membership

	
  * 18.11. Start of candidates campaign

	
  * 2.12. Ballots open

	
  * 15.12. End of voting

	
  * 16.12. Announcement of the results
