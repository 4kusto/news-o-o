There is a lot of excitement around the latest [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) snapshots because of new [KDE](https://www.kde.org) features and the newest stable [Linux Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/), which is expected in the next snapshot.

[Snapshot 20160715](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-07/msg00211.html) brought all those KDE updates Tumbleweed users were looking forward to like [Framework 5.24.0](https://www.kde.org/announcements/kde-frameworks-5.24.0.php), [Plasma 5.7.0](https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.7.0.php) and [Applications 16.04.3. ](https://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-applications-16.04.3.php)Breeze icons have a new feature and there is now jump list actions for tasks within an application available with KRunner thanks to the new Plasma. There is plenty of other new features with Plasma 5.7, so [check out the video to see what is new](https://youtu.be/A9MtFqkRFwQ).

Another snapshot expected today will likely update the kernel to [4.6.4](https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.6.4).

The [20160716](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-07/msg00253.html) snapshot brought updates in the repositories for bash, glibc and [GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/) 6, which fixes compile-time issues in the C++ front end.

There was also updates to autoyast2 and python-requests in the [20160716](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-07/msg00253.html) snapshot and three libraries were also updated.<!-- more -->
