Volunteers arrived on time at the venue, prepared everything, and did some last time checks. People started coming and in just a moment, our registration desk was crowded with Geekos who filled the place. Every visitor receives an openSUSE branded USB stick and a beautiful name-tag.










[![people at venue]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/DSC_0094-300x200.jpg)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/DSC_0094.jpg)Presentations started on time with the board welcoming the community to the event. They also shared some practical information with us, a call for help as well as a number of announcements. You can read in details [here](https://news.opensuse.org/2014/04/25/osc-has-started-follow-us-remotely/). People got excited and presentations of all kinds from community based to highly technical started.








Last but not least, Gnome, KDE and Oracle booths are there too! Geekos can ask and talk about anything they want to know about, not to mention take some flyers, stickers and t-shirts!
