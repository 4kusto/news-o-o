#### Please introduce yourself!


I was born in Emden at 18 June 1969. After leaving the school in 1990, I join the German Navy. Since 1994 I live in Nordholz near Bremerhaven with my wife and my two children (both girls).






#### Tell us about the background to your computer use.


Starting in 1985 with a Commodore 64, used for programming in Basic and Assembler I went on to buy my first x86 PC in 1992. Since then, I learned Pascal and Perl. Atn work, I administrate some Windows and Unix/Linux Server and manage the technical IT-Team.






#### When and why did you start using openSUSE/SUSE Linux?


Round about the year 2000, I bought a PC-Magazin with SuSE 6.4, installed it and used it for some time. Since SuSE 7.3, Linux replaced Windows on my PC, because I was able to configure my system on my own without a mouse. ;)






#### When did you join the openSUSE community and what made you do that?


In the year 2004 I joined the PackMan-Team. At this time I was looking for x86_64 RPMs. When I realized that there was nothing available, I rebuilt the PackMan-RPMs for x86_64.






#### In what way do you participate in the openSUSE project?


Nowadays I build my own packages for PackMan and OBS. I developed and maintain the PackMan Build Service with Pascal. Sometimes I support people in IRC and ML.

The great community!

#### What do you think the future holds for the openSUSE project?


A growing community.






#### A person asks you why he/she should choose openSUSE instead of other distribution/OS. What would be your arguments to convince him/her to pick up openSUSE?


One word: YaST!






#### Which members of the openSUSE community have you met in person?


I met many people at the last "SUSE-Release-Party" in NÃ¼rnberg, i.e. Darix, Henne, AJ and more SUSE-Guys, Pascal and many members of the PackMan-Team.
