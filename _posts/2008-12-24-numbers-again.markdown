[Again](//news.opensuse.org/2008/06/24/numbers/) here are the download numbers, from download.opensuse.org. If you don't know, in the first 30 hours after the release we are redirecting the traffic to akamai instead to the mirror servers. So what had we this time?

Total downloads: **172 TB!**

Ok, i though we can hit the 200TB barrier, but thats still pretty good. No, it's awesome :-)


More details:
58%  openSUSE-11.1-DVD-i586.iso
31%  openSUSE-11.1-DVD-x86_64.iso
3,0% openSUSE-11.1-KDE4-LiveCD-i686.iso
2,0% openSUSE-11.1-Addon-NonOss-BiArch-i586-x86_64.iso
1,8% openSUSE-11.1-GNOME-LiveCD-i686.iso
1,1% openSUSE-11.1-KDE4-LiveCD-x86_64.iso

The rest is below 1%. So what changed compared to the last release?

* again more 64bit downloads, this time +3% (last time +4).
* total plus of 5% of the tracked downloads

Other numbers i have so far ...

* 23518 [smolt](//smolts.org/) profiles uploaded. Please read [this](//zonker.opensuse.org/2008/12/22/reminder-to-smolt-we-want-your-hardware-profiles/) how to use it.
* 104742 updates (counted unique ip's)

After all it was again a very successfull release. Thank you all for helping us with it, even it was rather short before Christmas this time.

BTW: because of some "everything has to be done before Christmas" stuff, the contributor gifts are a little bit late this release. But on the other hand it's something really special this time :-) ...over and out, see you again in January :-)
