[![Failed geeko](http://en.opensuse.org/images/4/43/Failgeeko.png)](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Downtime)
The storage backend of the openSUSE Build Service at build.opensuse.org is causing again problems. Server side builds will not be enabled for now. The outage will be for at least today.

Access to api.o.o and the website build.opensuse.org are possible, so source modifications and local builds, e.g. via the command line client osc, are working. Just builds on the server will not happen.
