[![rsync-logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/rsync-logo-1.png)](https://rsync.samba.org/)What a start in the new year: the server running rsync.opensuse.org died with two broken hard disks at 2016-01-10.

As the hardware is located in the data center of our sponsor IP Exchange, we apologize for the delay it will take to fix the problem: we need not only the correct replacement hard drives, but also a field worker at the location who has the appropriate permissions and skills.

During the downtime (and maybe also a good tip afterward), please check on [http://mirrors.opensuse.org/](http://mirrors.opensuse.org/) for the closest mirror nearby your location that also offers rsync for you.
