[![Tumbleweed]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Tumbleweed-300x300.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Tumbleweed.png)A large amount of new packages were released in the 20150924 snapshot, which included the highly anticipated update to Mesa 11.

KDE Frameworks 5.14 release in the TW snapshot added needed functionality with 60 addon libraries to Qt. Breeze updated to 5.4.1, which provides some fixes for complications with GCC 5. Digikam updated from 4.11 to 4.13 to provide fixes for several KDE bugs.

In this last snapshot, HarfBuzz reached its first major version with 1.0.3. According to freedesktop.org, HarfBuzz, an OpenType text shaping engine, was used in the latest versions of Firefox, GNOME, ChromeOS, Chrome, LibreOffice, XeTeX, Android, and KDE, among others.

Other package updates in the 20150924 snapshot can found on the openSUSE [Factory mailing list](http://bit.ly/1P7e84F).

Tumbleweed had very few snapshots the past couple weeks, which was due to resources devoted to building the release of the Leap 42.1 Beta as well as some complications to build infrastructure, but new snapshots are forthcoming.

Tumbleweed users can expect LibQ 5.5 and systemd 224 in the next snapshot. Linux kernel 4.2 was checked in and might be in the next TW snapshot. GNOME 3.18 has yet to be released due to a test failure in openQA, but it should become available in one of the upcoming TW snapshots.
