You can help spread the word for openSUSE 11.0 before it's released!  The openSUSE project [now has countdown banners](http://en.opensuse.org/Countdown) that display the number of days before the next openSUSE release.

[![](http://counter.opensuse.org/11.0/medium)](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE_11.0)

You can display the banner on your site, and the rendering is done via the openSUSE server. You can find the code and the right language for your site on http://en.opensuse.org/Countdown. You can link the banner to [http://en.opensuse.org/OpenSUSE_11.0](http://en.opensuse.org/OpenSUSE_11.0) which has information about the 11.0 release and information on testing prior to the final 11.0 release.

The banners were inspired by a post by Pavol Rusnak, and we received fantastic code and graphics contributions from several members of the openSUSE community, including Pascal Bleser, Jakub 'jimmac' Steiner, Pavol Rusnak, Marek Stopka, Kevin Dupuy, and Billy Juliani. Thanks to everyone who contributed!

So, [grab a banner](http://en.opensuse.org/Countdown) and show your openSUSE pride. With less than 63 days until the 11.0 release date, there's no time to lose!
