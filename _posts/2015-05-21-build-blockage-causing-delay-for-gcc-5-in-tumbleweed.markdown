[![vector chameleon]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/vector-chameleon.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/vector-chameleon.png)The GCC 5 compiler is gradually making its way to be the default compiler for Tumbleweed, but until then, GCC4 is it. There is a blockage in the build caused by what some believe to be an issue with the signing key and libzypp.

For GCC 5 to move forward, it needs to pass openQA to build. Anyone willing to take a look at the code is more than welcome.

Many other items are being worked on in Tumbleweed and a new kernel is pending, but nothing is problematic and most of the items are easy fixes for the next snapshot, according to an update by Tumbleweed team.

Most of the work taking place these past few days have been bug fixes for the latest release of Plasma 5.3 and GNOME 3.16.2.

Other noteworthy items in the latest snapshot were updates to the libqt5 and LibreOffice. Python-keyring updated from 4.0 to 5.3 and there were some additional updates to YaSTâ€™s user experience and network.
