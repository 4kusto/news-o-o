Hi all,![Future Lizard!](http://en.opensuse.org/images/a/af/Future.png)
Your strategy team has been working hard, as promised, to incorporate the comments you have all given over the last few months into a new document. That document aims to describe where openSUSE stands right now, what users we target, what we are doing. Who we are has been covered pretty decently in the current [community statement](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Strategy_Community_Statement) and now we would like to present you with [**what users we target**](https://lite.co-ment.com/text/lNPCgzeGHdV/view/).

While you can all give us your input in the usual way (commenting down here, replying on the openSUSE mailinglists, on the forums and in private mail or IM), we have decided to make use of another commenting platform which is much more suited for a discussion like the one we are having. This is called [co-ment](http://www.co-ment.com/about/), a pretty awesome commenting tool under the [GNU Affero GPL](http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/agpl-3.0.html). We would like to ask you to give your input on the document there instead of in the other channels so the discussion will be more structured and easier for everyone to follow. Select some text you want to comment on (a word, a few words, a sentence) and choose the little yellow + sign on the top-left to add your comment. If you click a colored section of the text, you can see the comments which have been made on it and add your own. Easy peasy!

You can find the document [here](https://lite.co-ment.com/text/lNPCgzeGHdV/view/). And for reference [here the openSUSE Strategy portal](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Strategy) on the wiki. Please have fun!

Greetings,

Your strategy team
