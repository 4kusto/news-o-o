[openSUSE 11.4 still going strong](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/03/21/opensuse-11-4-still-going-strong/)

A bit over one week ago, [we released openSUSE 11.4](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/03/10/opensuse-11-4/) introducing [many exciting new features](http://en.opensuse.org/Product_highlights). The
      result was, as we wrote on Friday: [a big splash](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/03/12/opensuse-11-4-made-a-splash/).
      The 100.000 downloads in the first 24 hours and large numbers of blogs, articles and reviews
      all over the world were certainly impressive! So today we have a look at how the stats looked
      after one week. Did we keep the momentum going?

**On the numbers**

6 days after our previous report, downloads on bittorrent moved to well over 36.000
      downloads from the 12.000 in the first 24 hours. Still over 900 people are seeding. Meanwhile,
      the total number of downloads on [the download
        page](http://software.opensuse.org/114/en) has exceeded the 300.000 downloads now. Breaking the numbers down a little, we
      can see what images you are choosing. With over 113.000 downloads, the i586 DVD iso is the
      most popular, followed by 83.000 downloads for the 64 bit DVD. The live CDâ€™s are going fast as
      well, with over 37.000 for the KDE (32 & 64 bit) and 31.000 for the GNOME one. Quite a few
      users are even opting for the networked installation CDs, with about 16.000 downloads as
      well.

![openSUSE on Distrowatch](/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/distrowatch2.gif)

  


After [announcing
        they had openSUSE 11.4 support from day 1](http://blog.susestudio.com/2011/03/opensuse-114-support.html), the [SUSE studio](http://susestudio.com) team let us know last week that they had 1000 appliances build with
      openSUSE 11.4 in 24 hours. Well, since then, thousands more have been made! On the release
      day, traffic to the SUSE Studio website spiked by 62%. Right now, SUSE Studio image building
      still takes significantly longer than usual due to the continued increase in trafficâ€¦ They
      also let us know that it is now possible to automatically update your [current
        appliance to openSUSE 11.4](http://blog.susestudio.com/2011/03/upgrade-your-older-appliances-to.html) if you want.

**Party time!**

Right from the launch date on, there were [launch parties](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Launch_parties_11.4) all around
      the world. On [planet openSUSE](http://planet.opensuse.org/), the [first](http://www.myopensuse.hu/node/113)
      [reports](http://thefreecountry.wordpress.com/2011/03/18/release-party-opensuse-11-4/)
      [are](http://anditosan.blogspot.com/2011/03/opensuse-release-party-provo-ut.html)
      [showing](http://www.digitalflow.de/blog/2011/03/opensuse-11-4/)
      [up](http://www.bryen.com/opensuse-11-4-arrives-in-san-diego/) and the
      pizza-fuelled Dutch release party had a report on [connect.opensuse.org](http://bit.ly/gNqkOM)!

FigureÂ 2.Â openSUSE Cake!

![openSUSE Cake!](/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/opensuse-cake.jpg)

  


openSUSE Ambassadors in Greece brought their growing community together for a [release party](http://opensuseambassadors.blogspot.com/2011/03/opensuse-114-release-party-next-day.html) complete with cake. Yum!

FigureÂ 3.Â Dancing avatars!

![Dancing avatars!](/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/secondlife-dancing.jpg)

  


Among the many creative approaches to launch celebrations perhaps the Geekiest was the
      virtual launch party on Second Life. A DJ, chat, dancing and balloons allowed the online
      community to celebrate in style at Geekoâ€™s Place.

**Reviews and articles**

There are many more reviews now on the web. We have not spend much time updating [our in-the-press page](http://en.opensuse.org/In_the_press) as there is just too
      much. Just in Spain, for example, 10 major sites published reviews and notices â€“ that is not
      including blogs and many smaller sitesâ€¦

We do want to point to one particular review, the one by [The Linux Action](http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/?p=6068) show. Both
      gentlemen doing this are usually not huge openSUSE fans so we greatly appreciate their glowing
      review of 11.4! And, gents, count on us taking care of the thing you were missing: innovation
      and fancy stuff! There are several great initiatives upcoming as we [reported in this
        article about 2010](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/01/03/opensuse-finished-2010-big/) and surely, more will come.

**Novell and Attachmate**

Of course Novell supported our release with a [press announcement](http://www.novell.com/news/press/2011/3/opensuse-114-now-available-with-first-stable-release-of-libreoffice.html), mentioning some of our major new features. Chairman and CEO of
        [Attachmate](http://www.attachmate.com/), Jeff Hawn, [conveyed congratulations on the release of openSUSE 11.4](http://www.attachmate.com/Press/PressReleases/congratulations-openSUSE-project.htm) on behalf of his
      company.

**Social media stats**

Our Social Media guru Chuck â€˜pupâ€™ Payne reports some fantastic participation on our
      various social networking channels. The top five countries participating in our social pages
      were the USA, Indonesia (who have created their own page!), Germany, India, and Italy.

**Change Your Profile Pix**

As a â€˜last moment ideaâ€™, Chuck posted on the openSUSE page and group that users might like
      to change their pix to the Geeko character that Carlos had had created. A fun way to celebrate
      and promote the release. This was very successful, with 20% of users changing their profile
      pictures to our geeky, suit-wearing lizard!

**openSUSE Facebook Page**

The stats for the [official
        openSUSE Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/home.php?ref=home#%21/pages/openSUSE/45393742283) were up 148%.

FigureÂ 4.Â Facebook Interaction

![Facebook Interaction](/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/user_part1_facebook1.png)

  


Weekly and Monthly Active User are on the rise. There was a bit of dip on March 12
      (Saturday) after the release â€“ must have been all those machines busy downloading and
      installing! Page Likes are up 122% with postfeed back up 238%. The highest was the day of the
      release. Post views went up 118% with post feed back being up 441%.

FigureÂ 5.Â Interactions on Facebook

![Interactions on Facebook](/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/interaction_march_facebook2.png)

  


**Twitter**

Chuck set up a feed so that posts would be sent to Twitter. Itâ€™s hard to get exact
      statistics for Twitter, but over on the day we had a lot of #openSUSE tweets flying
      around.

FigureÂ 6.Â Twitter Charts

![Twitter Charts](/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/opensuse-twitter-march1.png)

  


We started mainly twitting and re-tweeting or news. Chuck sent direct tweets to Linux
      Magazine, Linux Pro Magazine, Linux Journal, which helped because they return retweeted and
      then created they own tweets with links to they websites. We really appreciated the support
      from the media!

**Conclusion**

Social and more traditional media was buzzing with openSUSE activity since the release. We
      had hundreds of thousands of users downloading the latest openSUSE. We had parties around the
      world (and more coming up). OpenSUSE 11.4 got a lot of attention!

[openSUSE accepted for Google Summer of Code!](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/03/22/opensuse-accepted-for-google-summer-of-code/)

openSUSE has cleared the first hurdle towards a series of successful Google Summer of Code
      projects! As was [disclosed last
        Saturday by OMGSUSE](http://omgsuse.com/content/opensuse-be-part-google-summer-code-2011): Google has accepted our proposal and we are now [a mentoring
        organization](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/show/google/gsoc2011/opensuse). This means that if youâ€™re interested in working a whole summer
      FULLTIME on openSUSE and getting paid for it, this is your chance! 

FigureÂ 7.Â This could be a very special summer for you!

<td align="right" >![This could be a very special summer for you!](/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/2725050242_ed79fa51cd_m.jpg)
</td></tr></table>

  


Thanks to the ideas on our [GSOC 2011 ideas
        page](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GSOC_2011_Ideas#General_ideas) and the mentors who have already stepped up, youâ€™ll have a great start in
      openSUSE development. While the number of slots is not decided yet, it is now time for you,
      potential students and mentors, to start fleshing out those ideas and talk to each
      other!

**Whatâ€™s next?**

Already the#opensuse-project IRC channel (on Freenode) is buzzing with activity. Students
      and mentors are discussing the proposals â€“ and that is exactly what is needed.

**Timeline**

Check out the [timeline on the Google Summer of Code site](http://www.google-melange.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2011/timeline). Right now, you need to know the
      following dates: On March 28 the student application period
      opens. Yes, that is next week! Students have until April
        8th to send in a formal proposal after which the openSUSE GSOC team will review
      the applications. Then Google will make the final decisions which will be published on the
        [GSOC 2011
        site](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/program/home/google/gsoc2011) on April 25th. Mentors should start [registering
        now](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/apply_mentor/google/gsoc2011), and work with their potential students to create good proposals!

**Students**

If you want to be a student and work on and within openSUSE for this Google Summer of
      Code, you need to start working on your proposal right away. First up, you should subscribe to
      the opensuse-project mailinglist. Introduce yourself, and let people know that you are looking
      for a mentor. If you are keen to dive right in, our development list is
      opensuse-factory.

Next up, that proposal. You might be inspired by something from the [openSUSE GSOC 2011 ideas page](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GSOC_2011_Ideas).
      There is a list of project suggestions with a variety of abilitities and skill sets including
      web programming, Python, Perl and Ruby on Rails. Alternatively, suggest and idea of your
      own!

Once you have your idea, start to write! Contact the openSUSE team working in the area
      youâ€™d like to work on and see if it is something they are interested in. Try to find a mentor,
      get feedback on your idea and find out if it is doable. In case you based your proposal on an
      idea from the idea page, contact the mentor (if there is one already) on IRC or by mail. If
      you have more generic questions you can always ask on the [#opensuse-project](irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-project) channel on the
        [Freenode servers](http://freenode.net/) or mail the opensuse-project
      mailing list.

More info about GSoC you can find on [this
        site](http://www.google-melange.com).

**Mentors**

If you are willing to mentor a student for GSoC 2011 for openSUSE, you should start with
        [subscribing to the gsoc-mentors
        mailinglist](mailto:gsoc-mentors+subscribe@opensuse.org). Itâ€™s also a good idea to keep an eye on the project mailing list and
      IRC channels for students needing mentors. Next up is [registering as a
        mentor](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/apply_mentor/google/gsoc2011) on the Google website and contact our admin [Vincent Untz](http://en.opensuse.org/User:Vuntz) to accept you. Ask questions on
      the GSoC mailinglist please!

Of course you will now have to help your potential student(s) to
        finish a good proposal and keep them engaged!

**Time to get started**

So, gear up, friends. It is time for a Summer of writing great Code for openSUSE. Talk to
      each other, ask questions, donâ€™t be shy â€“ and remember, there are no stupid questions, only
      stupid answers! If you are unsure if you are able to do do it, please come talk to us in the
        [#opensuse-project](irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-project) channel on
      the [Freenode servers](http://freenode.net/). Everyone has to start
      somewhere, and if it turns out youâ€™re not experienced enough yet or we donâ€™t have a slot for
      you there is no problem. We can still mentor you, help you out with setting up your
      development tools, answer your coding or packaging questions and teach you the ropes of
      working in a Free Software community. So you canâ€™t lose â€“ either way, you can be involved in
      openSUSE, learn valuable skills and have some fun!

[Linux Foundation 20th Anniversary of Linux Campaign and Video Contest](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/03/25/linux-foundation-20th-anniversary-of-linux-campaign-and-video-contest/)

Itâ€™s the 20th Anniversary of Linux in August and the Linux Foundation is kicking off
      celebrations at [The
        Collaboration Summit](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/collaboration-summit) which takes place April 6-8, 2011 at the Hotel Kabuki in San
      Francisco. A highlight of the campaign is the annual Video Contest, which this year focuses on
      the 20 year celebration and will be judged by Linux Torvalds himself.

</td></tr></table>

The Linux Foundation has invited members and the community to create their own 20th
      anniversary videos in advance, which will be featured on the announcement date of April 6.
      Videos submitted early enough to be available during the first days of the contest will
      receive additional promotion by The Linux Foundation.

This is a fantastic opportunity for video makers in the openSUSE community to get some
      visibility for their work and their favorite distribution! (Not to mention showing off how
      easy it is to make awesome videos with openSUSE.) So get started right away, and watch this
      space for details on how to submit your video.

[Stephan Kulow: GSOC Idea: Improve Clic Filesystem](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/03/24/gsoc-idea-improve-clic-filesystem/)

I really look for the perfect gsoc student: someone who has a brilliant idea, noone else
      thought of how to improve linux in general or openSUSE in specific and just needs my
      guidance.

But for those that need some ideas, my best bet is really to rewrite clicfs to make it
      even better. Right now clicfs is a FUSE filesystem hosting a loop image. So a page read goes
      from ext4->loop->fuse->clicfs->CD->clicfs->fuse->loop->ext4.

If it lived in the kernel, it could offer a block device you mount your ext4 on, leaving
      aside loop and
      fuse:

modprobe clicfs packfile=/read-only/openSUSE-kde.i586 cowfile=/read-write/.COWfile cowlog=/dev/ttyS0 
mount /dev/clicfs/0 /mnt 
chroot /mnt /bin/init

Great idea, no? For someone who wants to become famous, it would be the perfect
      target!

[Thomas Schmidt: Summer of Code 2011](http://www.digitalflow.de/blog/2011/03/summer-of-code-2011/)

Googleâ€™s [summer of code
        2011](http://www.google-melange.com/site/home/site) is approaching, and openSUSE.org got [accepted](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/mentor/request/google/gsoc2011/opensuse) as mentoring organization.

So now we are searching for students that would like to hack on one of our [proposed projects](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GSOC_2011_Ideas) from May
      23rd â€“ August 22nd (fulltime, 40h/week) being payed by Google (5000$ on success). Sounds like
      a fair deal, doesnâ€™t it? ![](http://www.digitalflow.de/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif)

There are even some days left to propose a new project to hack on! In that case we would
      try to find a suitable mentor from our community to get you started.

There are quite some interesting project proposals on our gsoc2011 wiki page, reaching
      from build service projects to SUSE Studio tools and distribution specific tools, as well as
      cross-distribution efforts.

I would like to mentor a student in the [OBS Mobile](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GSOC2011_OBS_Mobile) project which
      will create a nice interface to use the buildservice from your handheld. So if you are skilled
      in web technologies (jquery-mobile, rails) please apply and get the chance to hack this summer
      of code on this exciting project!

To get in contact with the openSUSE community please join channel **#opensuse-project** on freenode, or our project mailinglist at
        `<[opensuse-project@opensuse.org](mailto:opensuse-project@opensuse.org)>` and we will help you to get started.

[Will Stephenson: GSoC Idea: Build Service Plasma Widget Suite](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/03/24/gsoc-idea-build-service-plasma-widget-suite/)

Iâ€™m blatantly abusing GSoC for a project that I would like to see in openSUSE but that
      Iâ€™ve never had time to work on. But really itâ€™s a worthwhile thing to have: a set of Plasma
      widgets that users and developers can add to their workspace to make it easy to see whatâ€™s
      going on in OBS in the projects that matter to them. If you want to work on a fun project with
      cutting edge technologies such as Qt, QML, Plasma then head on over to the [GSoC 2011

[Alexander Naumov: GSoC 2011](http://thefreecountry.wordpress.com/2011/03/25/gsoc-2011/)

[Google Summer of Code](http://www.google-melange.com/site/home/site)
      (GSoC) is a program for students across the world to hack on interesting Free Software
      projects and get paid for their work. Historically, the program has brought together over 4500
      students with over 300 Open Source projects, to create millions of lines of code!

Of cource openSUSE hopes to participate in [GSoC](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GSOC_2011), while being mentored by
      experienced members of the community they are working in. We have many different [ideas](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GSOC_2011_Ideas) and looking for
      stundens. This is a good opportunity not only to help openSUSE and have a lot of fun working
      on interesting project, but also get 5000 $ if your project will be finished successful ![](http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif?m=1235253118g)[ Time for hacking](http://www.google-melange.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2011/faqs#timeline) is from May 23rd to August 22nd.

In my opinion one of the most interesting projects is the [Build
        Service Plasma Widgets](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GSOC_2011_Ideas#Build_Service_Plasma_Widgets). It will be very useful, I guess.

To get in contact with us please join IRC channel **#opensuse-project** on freenode, or our projectâ€™s ML at

[Stephan Kulow: Status: distribution](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2011-03/msg00701.html)

We finally managed to make the legal review steps transparent. So if you submit a
        package now to factory, a "legal-auto" group is asked to review it - this is done by a
        script of JÃ½rgen, which checks if the package was reviewed before. If not, a "legal-team"
        group is asked to review.

So the requests no longer appear to be ignored. In future we plan to do the same with
        some check-auto and check-manual to review build status and basic checks as soon as
        possible.

Greetings, Stephan P.S. Right now we can't publish new builds as kiwi requires a package
        that does not exist ;(

[SUSE Studio: New Beta Features: Revision Management 101](http://blog.susestudio.com/2011/03/new-beta-features-revision-management.html)

We've been working on ways to make collaboration on SUSE Studio appliances easier. The
        first step down that road is to make your appliance's build history act live a revision
        control system. To that end, our beta users will find a few new features available to
        them:viewing an appliance's complete configuration on one page; the opportunity to branch an
        appliance by cloning a specific version; and a dynamically generated changelog between each
        version. (...)

[Adrian SchrÃ¶ter: Policy proposal for Factory: Make source of tar balls trackable](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/03/21/policy-proposal-for-factory-make-source-of-tar-balls-trackable/)

I like to suggest a general policy for openSUSE:Factory project to document from where
          a tar ball (or any other file from upstream) is comming from. Why that ? It makes it much
          easier to review version updates and it guarantees that no one can inject some mal code
          via a modifed tar ball. 

So far I added the source services â€œdownload_urlâ€ and
            â€œtar_scmâ€ to our OBS instance, which downloads the files and stores them as
          files via a commit. Some people use them already, some others donâ€™t like them because they
          store the files with _service: prefix. 

In last hackweek, I added another way to handle this, which I would like to request as
          setup and policy for openSUSE:Factory project. You can add a project wide source service,
          for example the new â€œdownload_filesâ€ service. That would mean that no needs
          to add a _service file to the sources anymore. It is enough to add an URL to the spec file
          Source: tags. The service will automatically download it from there. 

But that does mean we still have have _service:download_files:osc-0.1.tar.bz2 file
          names ? Not when we also add the newâ€œ trylocalâ€ parameter and use latest osc
          versions. This parameter will let act osc to execute the services, but name the files
          without prefix and commit them together with the other files. 

Where is the advantage then ? The server is still validating that this is an identical
          file. It downloads it again and compares it. In case it is the same file, nothing will
          happen. 

What will happen, when the file differes ? We basically have two options, either we
          can let the service mark the source as broken or we would store the file with _service:
          prefix again. 

The later mode has the advantage that you can still do version upgrades via slow
          connections and let the server download the files.

Please find some more details about new possibilities with the source services [here](http://doc.opensuse.org/products/draft/OBS/obs-reference-guide/cha.obs.source_service.html). 

An example setup for this can be tested via
          

osc bco home:adrianSuSE:FactoryTest bc

and do for example a version downgrade to 1.05 version to see how it works. Please
          note that you need the osc from openSUSE:Tools:Unstable project for this.

We can also apply the still suse-internal spec formater and validator scripts via this
          way later one. 

Another advantage of this setup would be the new â€œupdate_sourceâ€ service,
          which could run in some openSUSE:Factory:AutoUpdate project and tries automatic version
          upgrades when upstream releases a new version. They could be reviewed and just picked
          (directly or with additional manual fixes).

[Alexander Naumov: osc plugin â€“ changes](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/03/23/osc-plugin-changes/)

[OSC](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:OSC) is a console client for
            [openSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/). Itâ€™s written on
          python and easy in studying and using packagerâ€™s tool. However there are situations when
          its functionality is not enough; sometimes we need something special. In this case to us
          will help plug-in mechanism, which in osc is realised very simply.

[Plugin](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:OSC_plugins) can use all of
          the features, which already implemented osc, as well as provide an output in a convenient
          format for you. For example, if I want to check changes in kdelibs4 between openSUSE:11.3
          and openSUSE:11.4, I can do something like
          this:

> osc rdiff openSUSE:11.3 kdelibs4 openSUSE:Factory kdelibs4

After that I will receive a detailed output about all changes. Yes, thatâ€™s greatâ€¦ but
          not always itâ€™s convenient. For example, in this case output will contain more than 2000
          strings, and I need time to find, say, a *.changes file if I want quickly to understand
          that has been changed. In case if I want to transfer output to processing to another
          program (as often happens in practice), I have to shape this data. Unfortunately osc is
          not as intelligent and canâ€™t show changes from one file (from *.changes, for example)
          onlyâ€¦(...)

[FrÃ©dÃ©ric Crozat: GNOME 3 Live image, release 0.1.1](http://blog.crozat.net/2011/03/gnome-3-live-image-release-011.html)

As always, another week, another release, aka 0.1.1

<td >![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2628/3777290817_9d3513c85f_z.jpg)
</td></tr></table>

This week release is a polish release : 

  * very few package changes

  * many services are disabled when booting live CD, improving its loading
                speed

  * password is no longer asked at all in live CD for root or standard (tux)
                user

  * when installing the image on a system (add liveinstall parameter on bootloader),
                some services are enabled back (apparmor, preload, firewall), thanks to Chris
                comments

Another service announcement : my GNOME3 openSUSE 11.3 repository will soon be removed
          ; packages will be only available for openSUSE 11.4 (same [OBS
            project](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=home%3Afcrozat%3Agnome3)). Therefore, I strongly suggest to upgrading your system to openSUSE
          11.4.

This week release is version 0.2.0. It features GNOME 2.91.92, including :

  * soon to be released Network Manager 0.9 and new UI integrated in GNOME Shell and
                GNOME Control Center (be careful, it has still rough edges)

  * a11y support should be improved

If you have installed this image or if you use the [home:fcrozat:gnome3](http://draft.blogger.com/) openSUSE and want to upgrade
          to 2.91.92, you can update using zypper up (if you
          still want to keep Network Manager 0.8) or zypper dup
          (if you want to switch to NM 0.9). Some packages might be uninstalled in the
          process.

"Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been

            going to go away. The code itself isn't well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It's only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don't have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

But then I have to recompile it. Would it be possible to have a higher default time in the included xautolck rpm, I suppose there are more people who would benefit from it and it is easy to accomplish."

Iâ€™m happy to announce LibreOffice 3.3.2 bugfix
            release for openSUSE. The packages are
          available in the Build Service [LibreOffice:Stable](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/LibreOffice:/Stable/) project. They fix various crashers, usability and
          translation problems, see the [libreoffice-3.3.2.2 release news](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/build/plain/NEWS?id=libreoffice-3.3.2.2) for more details. See also some notes about
            [openSUSE LibreOffice
          build](http://en.opensuse.org/LibreOffice).

The openSUSE LO team hopes that you will be happy with this release. Though, any
          software contains bugs and we kindly ask you to [report bugs](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Bugreport_LO). It will help us
          to fix them in the future releases.

**Other information and plans:**

The 3.3.2 packages includes KDE3 support again. Thanks Lubos Lunak
          who fixed all known issues and Ilya Chernykh who helped
          with packaging.

The 3.3.2 release is in a very good shape, so we
          decided to slow down the bug fixes release cycle. You might expect the 3.3.3 bug fix release two months from now.

LO-3.4 feature freeze is pretty close and we will
          start producing test packages in the [LibreOffice:Unstable](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/LibreOffice:/Unstable/) project. Please, be patient because there are many
          interesting changes in the build framework. They are good for the future but I expect some
          problems with packaging. I hope that I will manage to provide something by the end of
          April.

[Larry Finger: Weekly News for March 26](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-testing/2011-03/msg00010.html)

The Testing Core Team will hold an IRC meeting on March 28, 2011 at 17:00 UTC. The
          time change reflects that nearly everyone is now on summer time. 

We will be finalizing our plans for the next "Open Bugs Day", which will be from 00:00
          to 23:59 UTC, Saturday April 2, 2011. As written before, the emphasis will be on
          identifying those bugs reported for 11.2 and older that are still present in 11.4. We will
          not attempt to squash these bugs, but to make sure that none have been forgotten. After
          the release of 11.5 M5, we will have a bug-squashing day. We will also be testing and
          commenting on the Web application that Bernhard Wiedermann has written to help in bug
          selection and processing. 

This will be the last Weekly News before the event. Please plan to join the bug
          identification effort. The specific Web links for "Open Bugs Day" are not available to me
          now; however, you will be able to access them from [http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Testing](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Testing).

[Jos Poortvliet: The Collaboration Imperative](http://nowwhatthe.blogspot.com/2011/03/collaboration-imperative.html)

As you might have noticed, there is a little bit of a brush-up between GNOME and
        Canonical with KDE involved from the sidelines (just read [Planet GNOME](http://planet.gnome.org)). [Dave wrote a reasonable
          summary of this](http://blogs.gnome.org/bolsh/2011/03/11/lessons-learned/) and [so did
          Jeff Waugh in his series on the relationship between Canonical and GNOME](http://bethesignal.org/blog/2011/03/12/relationship-between-canonical-gnome/). In three
        sentences:

â€œCanonical gets a lot of criticism for creating a fork of the GNOME experience
          with Unity, instead of contributing upstream to GNOME Shell. Canonical responds that Unity
          was meant to be a GNOME project and their contributions are being blocked (giving
          libindicators as example). Suddenly Aaron Seigo from KDE weighted in, saying GNOME is
          indeed hard to work with.â€

I've been reading up on it and to some extend participating in the discussion on [identi.ca](http://identi.ca/conversation/65860477#notice-66972122). As you
        know, I'm interested in the subject of collaboration and this is a case where it clearly
        didn't work out for a variety of reasons. In this blog I won't try to weight in on the topic
        itself but rather argue that the psychological construct of â€œthe fundamental
          attribution errorâ€ can explain much of the conflict and how to avoid it.

But let's start with a sample of the discussion.

**forming an opinion**

I'm not exactly the type of person who makes up his mind easily. And the stories that
        came out of this debate were highly conflicting and confusing. According to [this](http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2011/03/collaborations-demise.html?showComment=1299814706744#c1432139034199491817), Canonical discourages its employees from contributing upstream. However,
        Aaron claims [GNOME does not WANT to collaborate](http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2011/03/collaborations-demise.html?showComment=1299827142761#c4757710492378664655). And Mark [blogs](http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/661):

â€œJeff also goes on to talk about Ted and Aurelien, who were proposing the app
          indicators work in GNOME and KDE respectively. KDE apps worked smoothly, Gnome rejected
          Tedâ€™s proposal.â€

So GNOME is uncooperative? Or does Canonical not get it, as Dave claimed? Is KDE just
        pushing things without listening? Depends on your point of view - the facts are vague. Read
        for example [this thread on freedesktop.org about the StatusNotifier (systray) spec](http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xdg/2010-January/011228.html) - there is
        about a 50% chance you'll decide KDE is the uncooperative one... This thread was referenced
        several times as proof Party X was inflexible and rude - where X was sometimes GNOME and
        sometimes KDE!

Makes you wonder what is going on...

**So what is real?**

A few days ago I had a call with [Jeff
        Waugh](http://bethesignal.org/). He [offered to talk in a
          dent](http://identi.ca/notice/66923835) and I'm glad he did. Of course, as usual the whole situation is more
        complicated than what you can discuss in 140 characters on twitter. The talk was very
        enlightening and made me think of a psychological concept.

**The fundamental attribution error**

FigureÂ 9.Â Call it a family trait...

<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="15%" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" ><tr >
<td align="right" >![Call it a family trait...](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2083/1917067112_07ff936211_m.jpg)
</td></tr></table>

  


People tend to attribute what happens around us in the world to intentions. We believe
        things happen for a reason. This is quite a strong human tendency already present in very
        young children. Put a 3 year old in front of a room where stones are moved around by some
        invisible means like magnets. Ask the kid what is going on and he or she will describe the
        events in the room in terms of "the blue stone wants to talk to the reevd one". We know stones
        usually don't really want a lot - so why does the child perceive such intentions? This
        phenomenon not only forms the base of early religions (attributing 'intentions' to weather,
        trees or growth of crops) but also results in making conflicts worse. Psychologists call it
          ["the fundamental
          attribution error"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error) and it is fundamental (hence the name) to our perception of the
        world.

So the reality is, besides that stones and trees don't have 'goals' and 'intentions',
        that often things happen for other reasons than someone having the intent to do that
        specific thing. Or in English, if a specification gets critical comments - maybe the
        respondent might have had other reasons than just wanting to be a jerk. Like being busy,
        tired or having misunderstood/missed a part of the discussion.

**Reality applied**

FigureÂ 10.Â Reality?

The talk with Jeff made clear that the major reason for GNOME not supporting the
        systemtray spec was timing, not lack of interest The focus of the GNOME project right now is
        understandably narrow: get GNOME 3 out the door. Something like interoperability, no matter
        how important, is not on top of the agenda. Jeff said he expects the FD.o systray spec to be
        supported hopefully in GNOME 3.2! The lesson: sometimes things interfere with cooperation.
        And the 'other camp', blissfully unaware of the real reasons behind lack of response or rude
        behavior, attributes it to a lack of willingness and support.

As another example, take the adoption of the Galago (notification) specification [and what went wrong according to this message by John Palmieri](http://bethesignal.org/blog/2011/03/15/timeline-gnome-user-experience-hackfest-2008/#comment-6027). And about GNOME
        and Canonical having misunderstandings: [Stuart Jarvis
          blogged how hard understanding a Free Software community can be.](http://www.asinen.org/2011/03/battling-misconceptions-what-is-kde/)

Now I'm not going to attempt to unravel all the events that led to this blog as that
        would simply be impossible. Nor will I attempt to figure out 'who is to blame' as that's
        pointless (and wrong anyway, as I argued above). What I can do is ask those involved to
          **think about the fundamental attribution error: if someone looks
          funny at you, it doesn't mean they hate you**. They might have something stuck in
        their eye!

**Action**

Ok, so maybe the others don't hate you. That doesn't solve the problem - yet. We all
        need to step up and do something. What?

**Make collaboration an explicit focus**

I [wrote about
          collaboration before](http://nowwhatthe.blogspot.com/2011/01/my-way-or-highway.html) and at FOSDEM there was a [cross-distro-collaboration
          discussion](http://nowwhatthe.blogspot.com/2011/02/fosdem-2011.html). As I said there, a big blocker for more openness is that we simply
        don't think about collaboration. We need to be aware of the opportunities for and benefits
        of collaboration. The whole discussion that I started this blog with might be negative and
        things are all a bit tense right now, but it shines the spotlight on something that needs
        attention! And positive initiatives like [Appstream ](http://distributions.freedesktop.org/wiki/AppStream) are
        happening. As [Seif
          Lotfy](http://seilo.geekyogre.com/2011/03/quick-update-from-the-world-of-zeitgeist/) wrote on his blog:

â€œAnd if you havenâ€™t noticed we are working with GNOME Shell, Unity and KDE. So a
          sense of collaboration is possible ;)â€

It just needs us to take notice! So, Mark, maybe blog about Appstream? It's using Ubuntu
        Software Center for the GNOME side, after all... Let's also focus on the positive
        projects!

**Talk together face to face!**

It is important to talk about concerns and frustrations. Considering the distance
        Brazil-Australia the best Jeff and I could do was a phone call but it was certainly
        enlightening. And I bet that you'll notice the same when you finally get to talk to those
        you've been fighting with on IRC and mailing lists for so long... Even then, realize that
        one single person does not define his or her whole project. Not everyone in KDE is as jumpy
        as Aaron; not everyone in GNOME is as French as Vincent Untz. It is important to share the
        results of a chat as well - blog about it (if your blog is aggregated on your projects'
        planet), or add results to a wiki or commit logs etcetera. Make sure the positive results
        persist!

Allison [wrote he also
          wants to start a bit of a discussion](http://allisonrandal.com/2011/03/12/a-little-help/) in the cross-desktop area which I welcome and
        support. Sounds like something which could make an impact and Allison, if you want my help,
        let me know what I can do.

**Take advantage of events to meet**

Don't overlook the opportunity to meet at events. For example, there is the Linux
        Foundation's [Collaboration Summit in San Fransisco](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/collaboration-summit) in a few weeks. It is [co-located](http://dot.kde.org/2011/02/05/camp-kde-2011-announced) with [Camp KDE](http://camp.kde.org) which seems to me an excellent opportunity for
        stakeholders to get together. Go a few days before the Collaboration Summit starts so you
        can get some face to face time with desktop folks.

![Time for a group hug?](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4115/4915241275_039b049bf6_m.jpg)

  


Then of course in August, there is the [Desktop
          Summit](http://desktopsummit.org). I'm one of the organizers and while collaboration isn't always perfect,
        the team has a common goal: organize a great event! Like the previous Desktop Summit in Gran
        Canaria I hope we can make some steps forward. This Desktop Summit will have collaboration
        even higher on its agenda than the last one and I hope this will have positive
        effects.

**Doing more, moving forward**

There certainly is more we can do to solve the conflicts. With apologies for the irony
        here, more blogs trying to analyze the whole thing may simply be fueling the flames more
        than extinguish them. Talking to people works better. I don't claim there was no talk,
          [there was](http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2011/03/shoot-messenger.html?showComment=1299953909118#c4811840744876232992). However, much communication we do happens over the web. And as we are
        all aware, that can easily lead to misunderstandings. So the face to face meetings I
        suggest, as well as an awareness of biases like the fundamental attribution error, can
        contribute to solving these conflicts in a more effective manner. As long as the results get
        documented in a few (public!) places and as such don't get forgotten the results of such
        meetings can be good and long lasting!

Personally, I'll stay away from the subject now - I've dented, tweeted and now blogged
        enough about it. I'll focus on the positive - including the Desktop Summit. And making sure
        the next openSUSE conference will have as much of a collaborative atmosphere as the last
        one!

[Klaas Freitag: Chemnitzer Linuxtage 2011](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/03/23/chemnitzer-linuxtage-2011/)

Last weekend I spent on [Chemnitzer
          Linuxtage 2011](http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2011/) which is a popular linux event in Chemnitz, Germany. It was the
        first time I have been there and was very positively surprised. It is a very well organised
        event, in a building providing the perfect environment and a large amount of volunteers
        helping to make the whole weekend enjoyable and relaxed. Thanks for that, it really was fun
        to meet so many people in this all-inclusive atmosphere

</td></tr></table>

openSUSE had a booth there (thanks Fedora for the picture) and we were lucky enough to
        have brand new 11.4 promo DVDs there which were handed to interested people. openSUSE 11.4
        in general is very well received at most visitors, they were quite happy with our latest
        release. That is also true for the feelings for openSUSE all over: I heard so much positive
        feedback about what we do and how we do it, for example the OBS with the collaboration
        features, the distribution or the activity all over. People recognize our efforts.

I gave a talk about [Kraft](http://volle-kraft-voraus.de), as people
        hinted me that there might be the right audience for the topic of Linux in the small
        business. The interest was huge, the room was more than full and people seemed to like the
        way I was approaching the challenge. Unfortunately I had to fight with the notebook/beamer
        phalanx in the beginning (I apologize for that) so that I had to skip the live demo of Kraft
        in the end. But still I got a lot of interesting discussions afterwards and got some nice
        contributions already. Thanks for that. 

On saturday noon there was a â€œDistribution competitionâ€ where I was pulled
        in to show openSUSE. It went ok for all distros taking part and was fun for us presenting 

![](http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)

Booster Michal was giving a workshop about creating packages in the OBS for multiple
        distributions and a very well â€œreceived whats new in 11.4?â€ talk was given by
        Sirko in the beginners track. 

It was a great event, even though I quite exhausted arrived home late on sunday night. I
        will be there next year again.

        [Kai-Uwe Berhrmann: Oyranos on CLT 2011](http://oyranos-cms.blogspot.com/2011/03/oyranos-on-clt-2011.html)

The weekend on Chemnitzer Linux Tage happened in a very nice atmosphere at the TU
        campus. 

The Oyranos booth had this year lots of place to show ideas on the hot topics like
        desktop and print colour management. Unfortunately my long planed co exhibitor could not
        make it to Chemnitz to show openSUSE-medical. We planed to display medical images on a
        properly setup 30-bit system as is required by the DICOM specification. Sirko Kemter
        designed one artistic 2 meter banner and helped with the basic design of the other posters,
        which we used for the new space. The Oyranos posters included some schematic graphics and
        the usual "Why do we need colour management" style explanations. For the later one I
        sketched a comparison of three non colour managed monitors showing the same fashion person.
        The SVG graphics from the open clip art library was colour converted to three real world
        monitor profiles. It resembles a typical shop over web situation, where colour counts for
        selection of the right looking goods.

</td></tr></table>

Several visitors allowed me to start the actual SuseStudio created Oyranos LiveCD on
        their laptops with different success. We used the exhibited measurement devices and a camera
        target to create custom ICC profiles for use in digikam, Scribus, Inkscape and friends. The
        LiveCD is still based on openSUSE-11.3 and worked in many but not all cases. I found it
        impressive how good looked the featured KDE desktop, when the CompICC plug-in launched
        immediately. Working OpenGL, which is needed for the desktop colour server shader, was still
        not always available.

The newest openSUSE-11.4 version was demonstrated on the neighboring openSUSE booth.
        openSUSE-11.4 was released only some days ago. The [OBS ](http://software.opensuse.org/)color_management repository was updated
        with the help of Stanislav Brabec just some days before to have nearly all packages build
        for 11.4. Thus Oyranos workes flawless on 11.4 too.

All in all a great weekend with lots of good talks and meeting of old and new
        friends.

[Cornelius Schumacher: Show us your work on the free desktop](http://blog.cornelius-schumacher.de/2011/03/show-us-your-work-on-free-desktop.html)

The deadline for the [Call for
          Participation](https://desktopsummit.org/cfp) of the [Berlin Desktop
          Summit](http://www.desktopsummit.org/) is approaching. The deadline for submitting proposals for presentations and
        lightning talks is tomorrow. So you still have the chance to submit a presentation and talk
        about your work on the free desktop at the wonderful event in Berlin that the desktop summit
        promises to be. It takes place from 6th to 12th August this year and combines the annual
        conferences of the [KDE](http://www.kde.org/) and [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/) communities.

Some of you might think that your contributions to the free desktop to the event are not
        relevant enough to warrant submitting a talk. That often is not true. While we will have
        well-known speakers who have done ground-breaking things on the free desktop, we all have
        started small, and sometimes especially the small projects, which are still young, are the
        most interesting ones to hear about. So please don't hesitate to try it, submit a
        presentation, talk about the projects you are passionate about, share the love for the free
        desktop with the community. Berlin is the right place for this.

[Holger Hetterich: SMB Traffic Analyzer 1.2.3 released](http://holger123.wordpress.com/2011/03/23/smb-traffic-analyzer-1-2-3-released/)

Should you read this in a blogroll, and **think what you read is from outer space**: This article is about the
        **SMB Traffic Analyzer project**, more information is [here](http://holger123.wordpress.com/smb-traffic-analyzer/).

The team is happy to announce the release of **SMB Traffic Analyzer
        1.2.3**. It is loaded with new features and lots of bug fixes, driving SMBTA
      forward in terms of scalability, performance, and functionality. Letâ€™s dive into and begin
      with the most important news on **smbtad**, the daemon program
      collecting data. A problem identified by several users was the fact that the created database
      grows too large after a short time. Well, at this level **smbtad
      **was doing real data mining and stores any single VFS function in itâ€™s database. A
      copy of a single file that is larger than a megabyte could create more than a hundred entries
      in the database. **smbtad** now solves this issue with a reworked
      cache subsystem that is implemented as a bi-tree algorithm adding up similar VFS entries for
      up to 5 seconds, and thus creating an interpolation of the data to be stored. The result is a
      much smaller database and should make **smbtad** much faster. The
      user can change the time period while smbtad is summing up similar entries, and also force
      smbtad to do full data mining if wanted. (**bnc#669679**).

If your main target for using SMB Traffic Analyzer is to generate graphics with **rrddriver** or to run **smbtamonitor**,
      there are good news. **The database handling in smbtad can be completely
        shut down.** In this mode, smbtad only acts as a repeater, sending the data to the
      real-time clients, without the overhead of maintaining the database. The client programs have
      been adapted for this (**bnc#668193**).We have implemented a way
      to parse data from the VFS module without re-allocating the data in the systems memory. This
      makes smbtad much faster, reduces memory handling a lot, and much of the underlying code has
      been simplified (**bnc#671346**). The real time monitor code had
      problems when several smbtamonitor instances where connected, and the throughput display did
      not work in 1.2.2. As a consequence, we reworked the monitor code, simplified the code a lot,
      and removed throughput calculation from smbtad, reimplementing it in the **smbtamonitor** client (**bnc#669809**).

FigureÂ 14.Â This picture is showing the HTML output of a fuzzy search done on a SMBTA Stresstest appliance.

</td></tr></table>

  


Due to a bug in the CmakeFile of 1.2.2. both smbtad and smbtatools where unable to install
      anywhere else than /usr; the installation prefix can now be given with the
      CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable (**bnc#673767**). The **smbtatorturesrv** program, distributing unique filenames and supporting
      smbtatorture when running networked and in parallel, sometimes crashed on 32bit architectures,
      fixed in **bnc#667101**.

Two new functions have been added to smbtatools. First off, thereâ€™s now a fuzzy search
      function in **smbtaquery**, allowing to do searches over the
      whole data set and supports unix wildcards. If the given search pattern is found, the function
      is identifying the object (**bnc#599145**).

</td></tr></table>

  


Also, **smbtaquery**, now includes a throughput calculation
      function, to let the[ ](http://holger123.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/smbtamonitor-1-2-31.png) user
      quickly view the data throughput of an object over the last minutes, hours or even days
        (**bnc#668190**). As mentioned before, throughput display in
        **smbtamonitor** did not work in 1.2.2. **smbtamonitor** now does this on itâ€™s own, no longer requesting this calculation
      work from smbtad, and the interface has been slighty reworked. And finally, it now has
      keyboard handling.

The â€œtopâ€ function of smbtaquery has been reworked to display more information on the
      entries in the produced list. With every user and share, the domain is listed, and with any
      file, the corresponding share and domain is shown additionally (**bnc#668172**).

The SMBTA documentation has of course been updated to reflect the current state and is
      already uploaded [here](http://morelias.org/smbta/smbta-guide.html). [openSUSEâ€™s Buildservice](http://build.opensuse.org) already consumed SMB Traffic
      Analyzer 1.2.3, and [downloads are available](http://holger123.wordpress.com/smb-traffic-analyzer/smb-traffic-analyzer-download/). Furthermore, with version 1.2.3, **SMB
        Traffic Analyzer** debuts on [Gentoo
        Linux](http://www.gentoo.org), and shall be available in the Gentoo Software directory soon. Of course, SMB
      Traffic Analyzer should appear in **openSUSE Tumbleweed** very
      soon.

</td></tr></table>

  


In other news, SMB Traffic Analyzer recently got **print media attention with a six page long, workshop-like
        article** about it in the German [ADMIN Magazine](http://www.admin-magazin.de/). The article is very detailed and
      really good in showing what SMB Traffic Analyzer can do and how to configure it, and even
      describes the SMBTA Stresstest appliance! Good stuff, the SMBTA Development team is happy
      about this work and suggests to buy the magazine if you read German and are interested in SMB
      Traffic Analyzer. Moreover, we added a new page â€œ[Develop/Contact/Contribute](http://holger123.wordpress.com/smb-traffic-analyzer/contribute/)â€ to the homepage, to make it easier for people to get
      into SMB Traffic Analyzer development, or for users to talk about SMBTA. A new release of the
      SMBTA Stresstest appliance is ahead, including SMBTA 1.2.3, making it easy to give it a quick
      test. Stay tuned.

[Advance discontinuation notice for openSUSE 11.2](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2011-03/msg00004.html)

Dear opensuse-security-announce subscribers and openSUSE users, SUSE Security announces
      that the SUSE Security Team will **stop releasing updates for openSUSE
        11.2 soon**. Having provided security-relevant fixes for the last two releases and
      two months, we will **stop releasing updates after May 12th
        2011**. Discussions on whether a community driven extension of the maintenance like
      Evergreen for openSUSE 11.1 are ongoing. As a consequence, the openSUSE 11.2 distribution
      directory on our server download.opensuse.org will be removed from /distribution/11.2/ to free
      space on our mirror sites. The 11.2 directory in the update tree /update/11.2 will follow, as
      soon as all updates have been published. (...)

        backend, support for ipset, and the rudimentary Poulsbo graphics driver; the kernel hackers
        have now also completely eradicated the BKL. Greg Kroah-Hartman has taken up maintaining the
        series 33 kernel again because it is the basis of the real-time branch.**

Less than 24Ã½hours after releasing Linux 2.6.38 [on
        Tuesday last week](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/What-s-new-in-Linux-2-6-38-1205467.html), Linus Torvalds started merging the changes for Linux 2.6.39.
      Among the commits that have already been added is the [Xen network
        backend](http://git.kernel.org/linus/f942dc2552b8bfdee607be867b12a8971bb9cd85) for Dom0 kernels â€“ however, the storage backend also required for operating
      a meaningful Dom0 has not yet made it into the kernel.

As expected, the last remaining components that use the Big Kernel Lock (BKL) have now
      been removed, allowing the kernel hackers to completely eradicate the lock via a commit
      entitled â€œ[BKL:That's all,
          folks](http://git.kernel.org/linus/4ba8216cd90560bc402f52076f64d8546e8aefcb)â€. Among the [new
        additions](http://git.kernel.org/linus/a7b4f989a629493bb4ec4a354def784d440b32c4) is the support for the sixth generation of the [ipset](http://ipset.netfilter.org/) program for optimising certain netfilter
      policies. In the staging area, the developers also [added](http://git.kernel.org/linus/0867b42113ec4eb8646eb361b15cbcfb741ddf5b) a
        [rudimentary graphics driver](http://www.h-online.com/news/item/Rudimentary-open-source-driver-for-Intel-s-GMA500-Poulsbo-1195125.html) for the GMA500 graphics chip found in Intel's US15W

While browsing across some open-source projects, I have seen code snippets of
        type:

for (i = 0; i < n; ++ i )

The pre-increment â€œ++ iâ€ confused me as to why one should use it, as post
        increment is most commonly used. Googling told me that pre-increment is faster than post increment as the value of i need not be stored to a temporary register before the increment operation. This sounded logical to me and I believed it
        and used pre-increment in all my loops. I didn't bother to measure it though. (...)

        [Berthold Gunreben: iTunes on openSUSE 11.4](http://azouhr.wordpress.com/2011/03/22/itunes-on-opensuse-11-4/)
      

In order to use iTunes University, I had to install iTunes on my notebook that is
        running openSUSE 11.4. It is quite easy to get some old version of iTunes from [http://www.oldapps.com/itunes.php](http://www.oldapps.com/itunes.php) but
        trying to install it on a 64bit machine with wine always failed.

In the end, I could install a 32bit version by doing the following:

rm -rf ~/.wine #(don't do this if you have other wine applications installed, it basically kills any previous wine installation)
export WINEARCH=win32
wine ~/Downloads/iTunesSetup1021.exe

To start iTunes later on, it is sufficient to run the following
        command:

wine c:/Program\ Files/iTunes/iTunes.exe

Unfortunately, with most of the available courses on iTunes University, I get conversion
        errors. To circumvent this, I just download the respective courses and view them with
        mplayer:

cd ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/iTunes U/
mplayer -vo xv <course file>

This is not too nice, but at least it allows me to view iTunes U courses without the
        need for an operating system I do not own.

[Dominique Leuenberger: how to
          fix brp and rpmlint warnings â€“ today: Expression compares a char* pointer with a string
          literal](http://dominique.leuenberger.net/blog/?p=151)

After having seen this kind of question several times, I think it could be interesting
        to start creating a small â€˜series of rpmlint errors and their typical fixesâ€.

Interested in it? So welcome to part #1 (this issue). The â€œseriesâ€ is not really fledged
        out, but I will try to write post for various errors / topics, as they come along. Just drop
        me a note with an error you have seen / experienced in OBS while building a package.

So what does it mean, if OBS tells you this:

Expression compares a char* pointer with a string literal. Usually a strcmp() was
        intended by the programmer

Letâ€™s have a look at a very simple C program, to show the
        issue:

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {   
char *mytext;   
mytext = "Help";   
if (mytext == "Help") {     
printf("This should raise a warning");   
}   
return 0; 
}

Trying to compile this very simple C program, which on first sight many would probably
        say this is correct, will result in
        this:

$ gcc test1.c -Wall 
test1.c: In function â€˜mainâ€™: 
test1.c:6:14: warning: comparison with string literal results in unspecified behavior 

So, even though we had such an easy program, line 6 seems to be an issue for
        us:

if (mytext == â€œHelpâ€) {

The issue, as simple as it may sound, is the comparison of a pointer (char *) with a
        literal (â€œHelpâ€).

So how do we fix it? It involves changing the code, thus writing a patch (there are many
        good helps around for thisâ€¦ I wonâ€™t dive into patching here).. Of course, after having
        written a patch, be a good downstream, send it upstream! What you want to do here is to
        replace this comparison with strcmp (just as OBSâ€™ error message implied).

Look at this code
        now:

#include <stdio.h> 
#include <string.h>
int main() {   
char *mytext;   
mytext = "Help";   
if (strcmp(mytext,"Help")==0) {     
printf("No warning here\n");   
}
return 0; 
}

I changed â€œmytext == â€œHelpâ€ to strcmp(mtext,â€Helpâ€)==0 ([man 3 strcmp](http://linux.die.net/man/3/strcmp) will explain you whyâ€¦ 0 means
        the texts are equal, or â€™0 difference detectedâ€™ can help you remember that). As the code was
        too simple and strcmp was not yet defined (this of course can also happen in packages you
        patch), I had to add an additional #include
          <string.h>.

Not too hard, is it?

So what do you think? Such a series of â€œhow to fix my typical brp / lint warningsâ€
        useful?

        [Berthold Gunreben: Simple udev Manipulations](http://azouhr.wordpress.com/2011/03/21/simple-udev-manipulations/)
      

When discovering the /sys file system, one can find quite a number of tunables that look
        interesting and really have effect on system behavior. Especially when experimenting with
        different values of read ahead for block devices or e.g. setting the stripe_cache_size for
        raid5, the performance for my software raid was improved a lot. 

To make that settings permanent, one can try and go for /etc/init.d/boot.local. More
        elegant however is to add some udev rule that does the necessary changes for you. It turns
        out, that this is quite easy. For example, the read ahead for block devices is found in
        /sys/block/*/bdi/read_ahead_kb. To check your current read ahead of /dev/sda, you may
        use:

cat /sys/block/sda/bdi/read_ahead_kb

However you may also want to change that setting. To accomplish that, just echo the
        desired number into the read
        ahead:

echo 4100 > /sys/block/sda/bdi/read_ahead_kb

To automatically do the setting when the device appears, just add the following file to
        /etc/udev/rules.d/83-ra.rules:

cat /etc/udev/rules.d/83-ra.rules
# increase readahead for sd* devices
ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="sd*", ATTR{bdi/read_ahead_kb}="4100"

When adding a udev rule for this, one just needs to know that â€œ==â€ (two equal signs) is
        a check, and â€œ=â€ (one equal sign) is a setting. 

Note, that some devices may take the read ahead from the underlying device; noteably
        when using drbd, setting the read ahead on the underlying device will have the desired
        effect.

[OMG! SUSE! team: On release day, it is like a big dump truck](http://mschlander.wordpress.com/2011/03/12/opensuse-11-4-has-been-released/)

Shortly after the initial release of openSUSE 11.4, I posted some [giant
        BitTorrent links](http://omgsuse.com/content/rapidly-downloading-opensuse-114-bittorrent) to speed up your downloading of openSUSE. Now that the initial
      flood of downloads has come and gone, I wanted to report back with some statistics shared by
      openSUSE Contributor [Marcus
        Rueckert](http://news.opensuse.org/2008/03/01/people-of-opensuse-marcus-rueckert/).

**Note**: These numbers
      are for BitTorrent downloads only.

As of last Thursday (March 17th), the numbers broke down as follows:

  * Full DVD images downloaded: **8228**

  * Live CD images downloaded: **4009**

If you're not terrifically familiar with the way that BitTorrent works, all users are
      constantly sharing data with one another but users fall into two buckets:
        â€œleechersâ€ and â€œseedersâ€. The â€œleechersâ€ are users
      who don't yet have the complete file, while the
        â€œseedersâ€ have fully completed their download and are **only** uploading to the other users. In short, having a lot of seeders means you
      have a good healthy torrent and downloads for new folks will be fast.

As of last Thursday, both the 32-bit and the 64-bit DVD images had over **one thousand seeders**, 20% more
      seeders than leechers too! That is incredibly awesome!

Marcus went on to say:

â€œI tested on friday morning and peaked at 11.2MB/s download speed for torrent which
        is almost max speed of my line.â€

This means if you download the DVD image right now, you
      are likely going download openSUSE as fast as technically possible!

      useful tool for the average end-user, for power-users and developers it is quite an impressive
      piece of technology, built on top of openSUSE and [KIWI](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:KIWI).

For developers, imagine creating an image of the ideal
      test machine, complete with repositories from the [openSUSE Build Service](http://build.opensuse.org) already enabled and all the necessary dependencies already

For power-users, imagine having a USB stick or a Live CD with your completely
      personalized, custom version of openSUSE. All set up and ready to go, whenever you need it.
      SUSE Studio does that.

With the initial release of 11.4, [SUSE Studio announced
        support for 11.4 appliances](http://blog.susestudio.com/2011/03/opensuse-114-support.html). Which means you could create a custom openSUSE 11.4
      appliance while your [ISO was

[Open Networking Foundation Formed to Speed Network Innovation](http://www.opennetworkingfoundation.org/?p=7)

PORTLAND, Ore. â€” March 21, 2011 â€” Six companies that own and operate some of the largest networks in the world â€” Deutsche Telekom, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Verizon, and Yahoo! â€” announced today the formation of the Open Networking Foundation (ONF), a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting a new approach to networking called Software-Defined Networking (SDN). Joining these six founding companies in creating ONF are 17 member companies, including major equipment vendors, networking and virtualization software suppliers, and chip technology providers.

In the past two decades, enormous innovation has taken place on top of the Internet architecture. Email, e-commerce, search, social networks, cloud computing, and the web as we know it are all good examples. While networking technologies have also evolved in this time, the ONF believes that more rapid innovation is needed. SDN fulfills this need by enabling innovation in all kinds of networks â€” including data centers, wide area telecommunication networks, wireless networks, enterprises and in homes â€” through relatively simple software changes. SDN thus gives owners and operators of networks better control over their networks, allowing them to optimize network behavior to best serve their and their customersâ€™ needs. For instance, in data centers SDN can be used to reduce energy usage by allowing some routers to be powered down during off-peak periods. (...)

[techrepublic/Jack Wallen: Will new openSUSE with KDE 4.6 bring distro back from obscurity?](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/opensource/will-new-opensuse-with-kde-46-bring-distro-back-from-obscurity/2347)

**Takeaway**: The openSUSE
          distribution nearly faded away into obscurity. But 11.4 brings this distribution back to
          serious relevancy. See what Jack Wallen thinks about the latest from the openSUSE
          developers.

Remember when SuSE Linux was a real powerhouse? YaST was one of the finest
        administration tools available and SuSE was one of the few distributions featuring the KDE
        desktop as the default. But then Novell purchased SuSE and things changed. Ubuntu came to be
        and new users flocked to a distribution that promised Nirvana for Linux users. And with all
        of the changes happening on the Linux landscape, [openSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org/en/) continued moving ever forward, not swaying from its path, not causing
        rifts in the Linux community, and eating their own dog food.

The only problem? openSUSE seemed to be slowly disappearing. With Ubuntu taking up the
        majority of the mediaâ€™s attention and end users looking for something more compatible and
        easier to use, only the faithful few remained with openSUSE.

But now a new release for the distribution, the project that is controlled by the
        community, is poised to bring it back out of obscurityâ€¦and with good reason. Actually, I
        will give you two good reasons: KDE 4.6 and Tumbleweed/Factory. (...)

[h-online/Linux Foundation switches MeeGo TV on](http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Linux-Foundation-switches-MeeGo-TV-on-1213423.html)

The [Linux Foundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/) has [announced](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/announcements/2011/03/linux-foundation-announces-meego-tv-working-group) the creation of the MeeGo Smart TV Working Group. The working group is
        to be tasked with looking at how to use MeeGo in the new "Smart TV" market of internet
        connected TVs and set top boxes. Among the participants in the group are Intel, Nokia, MIPS,
        Telecom Italia and [Amino Communications](http://www.aminocom.com/). The
        working group will expand MeeGo's reach from it's current target devices: netbooks, tablets
        and automotive systems.

The group will have its first meeting in April and will be submitting code to produce
        twice yearly releases (in the first and third quarters of the year) as it establishes how to
        make use of the MeeGo Linux platform and it's Qt based user interface. The working group
        will also have to working out how to create a [10 foot user interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10-foot_user_interface)
        for MeeGo devices which have, to date, been focussed on touch or handheld interfaces.

[Networkworld/Jon Brodkin: Linus Torvalds: Android copyright violation claim is bogus](http://standardsandfreedom.net/index.php/2011/03/17/what-does-community-mean-part-2/)

Linux kernel creator Linus Torvalds has said new claims that [Android violates
          the Linux license](http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/031711-android-linux-gpl.html) are â€œtotally bogusâ€.

Intellectual property attorney Edward Naughton [argued last week](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/edward-j-naughton/googles-android-contains-_b_836697.html) that with Android, Google improperly took Linux code and passed
        it on in a derivative work without using the GPLv2 license. But it seems that no lawsuits
        have been filed on the issue and several open source observers have disputed Naughton's
        argument. (...)

[Unixmen/Anuradha Shukl: Open source Kimono Lanterns to the rescue](http://www.unixmen.com/news-today/1579-open-source-kimono-lanterns-to-the-rescue)

The devastation in Japan is heart rending and compels each of one of us to contribute to help improve the situation. Similar thoughts have been running through developers at [Freaklabs](http://freaklabs.org/) . At the [hackerspace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) they are involved with, a solar rechargeable lantern was designed for garden and patio use. Called the Kimono Lantern, today they are able to put it to better use. Donating the complete design to the open source hardware community, they are indeed standing true to the commitments of the Open Source community.

(...)

[Kimono lanterns](http://www.pcworld.com/article/222160/opensource_kimono_lantern_could_help_tsunami_victims.html) are basically designed for small output but with long battery life. Running on solar cells that are recharged due to exposure to sunlight will glow for 8 hours providing the quake victims much needed night light. As flashlights, and the other standard and regular artificial light sources area premium and essential for critical situations as in makeshift hospital rooms, a Kimono lantern should do the desired needful. Light the pathway and generally offer a comforting glow amid all the darkness. (...)

[Hubfolio/Matthew Casperson: Five things to do in your new OpenSuse 11.4 Installation](http://www.brighthub.com/hubfolio/matthew-casperson/articles/110077.aspx)

OpenSuse 11.4 is out, and it includes some of the latest and best software available for Linux. But there are still a few things you can do to spruce things up.

With KDE 4.6, Libre Office, the latest Linux kernel, a preview of what is to come with Gnome 3 and so much more, OpenSuse 11.4 is ready to take your [Linux desktop](http://www.brighthub.com/guides/linux-desktop.aspx) to the next level.

But while OpenSuse 11.4 does provide a rich ecosystem of Linux applications, there are still a few things every Linux user needs to make their desktop shine, and to make it functional.

Here are five steps to take after you install OpenSuse 11.4 to put the icing on the cake. (...)

[ITworld/Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols: OpenSUSE 11.4: A blast from Linux past](http://www.itworld.com/operating-systems/140885/opensuse-114-blast-linux-past)

I've liked openSUSE since before it was named openSUSE and went by the unlikely name S.u.S.E Linux 4.2 back in 1996. It's come a long, long way since then. Today, this Novell-supported community Linux distribution makes both a strong, server and desktop. For all that, though I've found in this go-around some fit and polish issues.

To test it out, I put openSUSE 11.4, on two computers. The first was a Gateway SX2802-07 desktop. This PC uses a 2.6GHZ Intel Pentium Dual-Core E5300 processor and has 6GBs of RAM and a 640GB hard-drive and was being wasted doing nothing but serving as a full-time Windows PC. The other was VirtualBox 4.04 VM (virtual machine) running on my Mint 10 desktop. Behind the VM was a Dell Inspiron 530S powered by a 2.2-GHz Intel Pentium E2200 dual-core processor with an 800-MHz front-side bus. This box has 4GBs of RAM, a 500GB SATA (Serial ATA) drive, and an Integrated Intel 3100 GMA (Graphics Media Accelerator) chip set. (...)

[Das U-Blog/Prashanth Venkataram: Review: openSUSE 11.4 KDE](http://dasublogbyprashanth.blogspot.com/2011/03/review-opensuse-114-kde.html)

This review you are about to read was originally going to be about Scientific Linux 6. However, two things changed that: one, openSUSE 11.4 got released yesterday, though I did think about doing Scientific Linux today and openSUSE in a few days, and two, Scientific Linux didn't play well with either UnetBootin or MultiSystem. In any case, that review will have to wait a bit. (...)

[Linux Journal/Susan Linton: Mingle with openSUSE-ites on connect](http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/mingle-opensuse-ites-connect)

The ever-inventive openSUSE gang have come up with another cool service to enhance user experience and promote good will. This time it is a little less technical and a little more social. Connect with other openSUSE users, developers, and groups. You can make friends, find out the latest news, and get involved.

Henne Vogelsang introduced the new service a few days ago and he said connect was the answer to "What are we really doing when we develop a new tool to handle openSUSE users and groups?" The purpose is to connect people to projects, groups and with each other; connect faces to names, nicknames and to email addresses; and, ultimately, connect all our other tools to this one so we can share the data, as Vogelsang explained. In other words, it's openSUSE's very own little social network. (...)
