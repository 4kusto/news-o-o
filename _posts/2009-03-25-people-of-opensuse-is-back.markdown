We will start new round of [People of openSUSE](http://en.opensuse.org/People_of_openSUSE) interviews with openSUSE community members. Just as before, the aim is to make you familiar with people behind openSUSE project. 

We will attempt to give fair share to each part of openSUSE activity, addresing developers, testers, document writers, translators, art creators, user support on IRC, mail lists and forums, in marketing and many more. Most of them are known names, but we will also try to reach people that are not exposed to world wide public, but have significant contributions to openSUSE. They can be active in local user groups, or in languages other than English. 

For this group we need your proposals with description of activity, some way to verify that, the way to contact person and translator if they don't use English. You can file proposals on [People of openSUSE](http://en.opensuse.org/People_of_openSUSE), or you can subscribe to opensuse-marketing@opensuse.org and post proposal there. To subscribe please use links posted on [the openSUSE wiki](http://en.opensuse.org/Communicate/Mailinglists).
