The GNOME team will hold its first public meeting this Thursday at [noon EDT/18:00 CST/1600 GMT](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=27&month=9&year=2007&hour=16&min=0&sec=0&p1=0).

In general we will follow the [meeting guidelines](http://en.opensuse.org/Meetings/About) outlined for the openSUSE project, except we will use [#opensuse-gnome](irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-gnome) as the IRC channel.  Please add agenda items and questions to the meeting page.  This particular meeting will be centered around 10.3 cleanup, 11.0 planning and the process/planning improvements for the team (ie having these meetings, and re-organizing our section of the wiki like we've done over the past couple of weeks).
