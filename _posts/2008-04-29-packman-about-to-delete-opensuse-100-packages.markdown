As SUSE Linux 10.0 [has reached](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2008-01/msg00000.html) its [end of life](http://en.opensuse.org/SUSE_Linux_Lifetime) in November last year, the [Packman](http://packman.links2linux.org/) team will be removing all SUSE Linux 10.0 packages from its repository end of this week. If you want to keep them aside, make sure to [download a copy](http://ftp.skynet.be/pub/packman/suse/10.0/) before.

And as for good news, the Packman team has started to [build its packages for openSUSE 11.0](http://packman.links2linux.org/search?q=&scope=name&luatleast=&luatmost=&sort=name&dist=29) (against Beta 1) since a few days. You can enable it by going to _YaST -> Software Management_. From there select _Repositories -> Manage Repositories_ in the menu. Then select _Add -> Community Repositories_, and from here select the _"Packman Repository"_.

The [codecs one-click-install](http://opensuse-community.org/Restricted_Formats/10.3) for 11.0 should be updated and available next week.
