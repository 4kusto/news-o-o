As quickies we combine news not worthy of an own story: Next week, [a public openSUSE 10.3 Alpha 7](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2007-07/msg00280.html) will be released which previously was planned as internal Alpha 6+. SUSE veteran [Markus Rex has been appointed chief technology officer](http://www.linux-watch.com/news/NS6593319451.html) of [The Linux Foundation](http://www.linux-foundation.org/). As second site after openSUSE News, [www.opensuse.org](http://www.opensuse.org/) shines in our new design; all three sites it links to will see new functionality and/or design going live within the next days.
