Thanks to[ KIWI-LTSP](http://wiki.opensuse.org/LTSP), we also have the most advanced and easiest [LTSP](http://ltsp.org) implementation on this DVD, with Easy-LTSP GUI andÂ  [iTALC](http://wiki.opensuse.org/SDB:KIWI-LTSP_iTALC) integration with LTSP, managing classroom has never been this easy. LTSP allows schools to run multiple diskless PCs as "thin clients", no special hardware required, any PC with 256MB RAM with onboard NIC capable of PXE booting is sufficient to run this latest operating system.

Of course what good would a computer be if it cannot play games,  music and movies, right? We have all of those in this DVD too. Apart  from Linux games, wine is bundled to run some Windows applications, so  few games might work on that too, you can maybe play your old DOS games  in DOS Box too.
