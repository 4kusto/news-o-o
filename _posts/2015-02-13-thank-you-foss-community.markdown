February 14 is a day to express your love for others and in keeping with that theme, openSUSE extends its gratitude toward the organizations and people who make Free and Open Source Software a reality.

Every year, the [Free Software Foundation Europe](http://fsfe.org/index.en.html) asks all FOSS users to think about the hard-working people in the Free Software community and to show them their appreciation individually on this ["I love Free Software"-Day](http://fsfe.org/campaigns/ilovefs/ilovefs.en.html).

<!-- more -->As users and distributors of FOSS, we are thankful for the contributors who dedicate their time and efforts to enable people from around the world to use, study, share and improve free software.

FSFE has done a great thing in raising awareness of contributions made by dedicated coders, developers and hackers through the "I love Free Software"-Day.
