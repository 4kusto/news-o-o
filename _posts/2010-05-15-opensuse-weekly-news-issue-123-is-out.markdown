I'm going to keep my  views on the matter quiet until we get some dialogue going, so if you  want to hear my thoughts (and let's face it who doesn't?Â ;-) ) best you  start airing your opinions. 

     So what is the topic? That of Community Manager.  As many are  aware, Novell have started interviewing for a replacement.  Some were  not happy with how the role was done in the past and some and some were,  but the key part of that statement is PAST!  Let's move on and look to  the future, and as part of that looking forward to the future I would  like to hear what YOU would like from the new Community Manager?"

### From Ambassadors





#### [Sirko Kemter: Linuxwochen Vienna](http://karl-tux-stadt.de/ktuxs/?p=2312)




     "Last week I was with Pavol Rusnak and Michal Hrusecky in  Vienna at the Linuxwochen, so we boosted openSUSE on this event.  Linuxwochen is a interesting idea there are some events in the whole  country its a kind of Linux roadshow. But they are not all on the same  day and if you like u can visit every event. There was events in Krems,  Graz, Eisenberg and Linz. This weekend take the event place in  Eisenberg. Not all events there are the same, some of them have special  interests so in Linz they are on the art akedemy and they are  concentrated to doing artwork with free software. There is 4 days long  every day a workshop for it. The organizers called me last year and  asked if I can make one of them." 



#### [Pavol Rusnak: LinuxWochen Vienna 2010](http://stick.gk2.sk/blog/2010/05/linuxwochen-vienna-2010/)




    "From Thursday to Saturday there was an event in Vienna held as a  part of longer Austrian tour called LinuxWochen. This opportunity could  not have been missed by openSUSE, so we formed a team consisting of me,  Michal and Sirko. 
     All three days were packed with more than 70 talks and  workshops. We had a stand directly next to Fedora™s one, handled by  Fabian and Zoltan, so we also had an opportunity to talk about our  distros and also to make fun about each other.Â :-)"

#### [h-online/Thorsten Leemhuis: Kernel Log: New stable kernels and drivers](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-New-stable-kernels-and-drivers-995820.html)




     "While new stable kernel releases seem to have become somewhat  less frequent, they now include more changes. Although the most recent  version of AMD's proprietary graphics drivers finally work with X Server  1.7, NVIDIA's drivers already work with version 1.8. Videos of the  Linux Audio Conference and the Collaboration Summit provide insights  into audio and kernel topics..." 



#### [h-online/Thorsten Leemhuis: Kernel Log: Coming in 2.6.34 (Part 4) - Architecture and virtualisation](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-2-6-34-Part-4-Architecture-and-virtualisation-998583.html)




     "Faster suspend and resume, better utilisation of power saving  mechanisms for I/O devices and a range of performance enhancements are  just some of the kernel infrastructure changes in Linux 2.6.34." 



#### [h-online/Thorsten Leemhuis:Kernel Log: Coming in 2.6.34 (Part 5) - Drivers](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-2-6-34-Part-5-Drivers-999566.html)




    "In his release email for Linux 2.6.34-rc7 last weekend, Linus  Torvalds indicated that version 2.6.34 of the Linux kernel will be  released soon. The following article describes the advancements in terms  of drivers and their infrastructure and concludes our "Coming in  2.6.34" mini series about the most important new features of Linux  2.6.34. The most important changes in the areas of network support, file  systems, storage subsystem, graphics hardware and architecture as well  as virtualisation were discussed in parts one, two, three and four of  the series, along with the drivers associated with these kernel areas."

### For Desktop Users





#### [Petr Baudis: pulseaudio “ quick™n'dirty playback over the network](http://log.or.cz/?p=86)




     "The joyful lives of many Linux desktop users are clouded by  many packages and frameworks that are well-intentioned and try to solve  real and painful problems, but which are immature, not designed in the  UNIX spirit, poorly documented and most importantly, do not really have a  working implementation. Oh well. I have taken the stance of patience  and ascetic acceptance of the new burdens “ instead of trying to purge  my systems of all that is unholy and evil, I spend that time trying to  debug and fix up the problems they incur (often in vain). Sometimes I  even file bugs, but that can be rather¦ unrewarding experience “ more  about that at another time." 



### For Commandline/Script Newbies





#### [The Geek Stuff/Sasikala: Bash Positional Parameters Explained with 2 Example Shell Scripts](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/05/bash-shell-positional-parameters/)




     "A parameter is an entity that stores values. It can be a name,  a number or some special characters. A variable is a parameter denoted  by a name. Some variables are set for you already, and most of these  cannot have values assigned to them. 
     These variables contain useful information, which can be used  by a shell script to know about the environment in which it is running." 



#### [Gabriel Stein: Problems with Grub?](http://gabrielstein.org/blog/?p=536)




     "Well, I posted a tutorial about clones, and who never forget  some steps making a clone? After the end of the cloning process, grub  just say no way for you. Important: just for cases which grub its  installed on MBR. 
There are many websites talking about specific errors, but I will give some hints which helped me sometimes.



     Frequent Error: its the Error 2³ on the stage 1.5 of grub  loading.  When this error occurs, please check your HDD configuration on  FSTAB and MTAB. Normally when we change some old machines which use  PATA HDDs to new SATA HDDs, Grub get confused with these devices. After  check FSTAB(/etc/fstab) and MTAB(/etc/mtab) after a successful clone  process, please pay attention on file device.map, usually at  /boot/grub." 



### For Developers and Programmers





#### [Tuxradar: Python + PyGTK + WebKit in 20 minutes](http://www.tuxradar.com/content/python-pygtk-webkit-20-minutes)




     "In season 2 episode 7 of our podcast we laid down the simple  challenge for each of the four podcasters - Andrew, Graham, Paul and  Mike - to produce something original for the website. Paul - eager to  show the world how much he, er, loves Python - has now finished his  entry, and you'll find it below: a video talking you through how to get  started with Python, PyGTK and WebKit. It's easier than you think!" 



### For System Administrators





#### [JiÅ™Ã­ Suchomel: Your own OEM configuration: YaST Firstboot](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/05/13/your-own-oem-configuration-yast-firstboot/)




     "Have you ever thought how users should configure their  systems, deployed by AutoYaST or kiwi? One of possible answers is called  YaST Firstboot. 
The YaST firstboot utility is a special kind of configuration  workflow that can be run after the basic system is installed. It is  started on the first boot of the system and guides a user through a  series of steps that allow for easier configuration of their desktops.  YaST firstboot does not run by default and has to be configured to run  by the user or the system administrator. It is useful for image  deployments where the system in the image is already configured (read:  AutoYaST, SUSE_Studio, KIWI), and end-user should do only the last few  steps, like setting the root password."

     "In this post I would like to show what openSUSE has to offer to ruby enthusiasts. 
     The latest openSUSE version ships with ruby 1.8.7, rubygems  1.3.1 and rails 2.3.2. The latest two being not so recent, here is where  the openSUSE project shines. Say hello to devel:languages:ruby and  devel:languages:ruby:extensions build service projects. 
     The first is a project containing a more recent 1.87 ruby  (p249 vs p72 in 11.2). However, as a build service project, it is built  on top of multiple targets so you can add this repository not only to  11.2 but also to SLE and older openSUSE releases."

We had the first round of API  review of new methods in KDEPIMLIBS for 4.5, and already cleaned up  quite a bit. Having multiple eyes look at the API is a nice way to  improve the overall quality of the API. We met with Andrey Moiseenko and  Alvaro Manera of Nokia, who work on calendaring for the next Meego  phone from Nokia. They use our KCal library, which they have  forked/extended for some special requirements they have. We™re now  making plans with them to integrate their changes back to our version of  KCal, so that both sides will profit from changes and have a single  point of maintenance"

S2Games made GNU/Linux clients for their Savage series and HoN is no exceptionÂ ! It runs pretty good on GNU/Linux and offer a native 64-bit client.



     Although the Savage series is free to play (with an option to  buy premium stuff) HoN will require one fee of $30 in order to play.  (SEA residents can still play for free at the moment). 
For an online game one payment for life is not much at all, some online games demand a monthly payment."
