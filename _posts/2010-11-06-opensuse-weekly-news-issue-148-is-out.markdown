 Deliver many optimal compiled openSUSE cores aiming to outperform any individualy (gentoo) compiled system!"

"There are not any good solution for non-experienced users to set up X. Please bring sax2 back again."

 Purpose: 




  1. Make it easy for developers to release an application 


  2. Make it easy for developers to market and for users to learn about that application 


  3. Make it easy for users to install the application (...)" 




####  [#310779: gtk2: cups printbackend does not provide a commandline](https://features.opensuse.org/310779)




"gtk2's lpr printerbackend provides a commandline useful for testing, using uncommon options or printing to available but unconfigured printers.  

  

 e.g. user configured printers close to his office, but needs to print once to a printer in a different building. lpr -PFar_away_printer could do this, but this is not available in e.g. Firefox printing dialog when the cups printbackend is active. The cups printerbackend lacks this functionality and the lpr backend is said to go away." 




####  [#310780: Provide python 3 bindings when supported](https://features.opensuse.org/310780)




"The new version of python, python 3, has been out for several years now. A lot of python bindings now support python 3. However, although openSUSE has provided python 3 for a while, it provides few, if any, python 3 versions of packages.  

  

 My suggestion is that python 2 be kept the default, but for python packages and bindings that support it, python 3 versions should be made available as well. I think the python in the name would be replaced by python3, so in additiona to python-numpy there would be python3-numpy, for example." 




####  [#310787: Intel(R) Trusted Execution Technology (Intel(R) TXT) Support](https://features.opensuse.org/310787)




"Intel(R) Trusted Execution Technology (Intel(R) TXT) provides a hardware dynamic root of trust for measurement (D-RTM). Intel TXT can be used to reduce the trusted computing base (TCB) of system SW such as an OS kernel or hypervisor/VMM. TXT provides platform configuration protection such as memory aliasing checks, register locking, etc. It also provides reset protection via a hardware memory lock and memory scrubbing. In multi-processor systems, Intel TXT strengthens the RAS capability through CPU-rooted measurement of the BIOS and hardware-enforced protections of RAS events. Finally, TXT provides for a platform owner -controlled launch control policy. (...)"

"Music loving Linux users take note: Though Amazon hasn't updated its Linux downloader for Amazon MP3 in ages, you can still get your MP3 fix off Amazon using clamz.  

  

 Amazon MP3 offers a really good selection of DRM-free music, including a fairly hefty selection of free songs and sampler albums. But Linux users have been getting the short end of the stick from Amazon lately, because the retail giant rarely updates the MP3 download client for Linux. That's not a big deal if you're just buying a single song, but it's a prerequisite for downloading Amazon albums. (...)"

####  [Brandon Philips: ghar: managing your $HOME in git](http://ifup.org/2010/10/31/ghar-managing-your-home-in-git/)




"For awhile I have struggled with rsyncing dotfiles between my development machines, laptop and workstation. As a Kernel developer I usually have one or more machines in a half broken state so being able to continue work in a familiar environment on one of the working ones is important.  

  

 A year ago Gavin, Graham and I worked up a plan to manage and sync home directory dotfiles with git. But, unlike other solutions we didn't want everything in one big git repo. Why? For example on a remote build machine I don't want my abook synced over but I do want my git and vimrc. Our original implementation didn't work out, as I explain below, but my new rewrite of our idea is working great. (...)"

Samba is configured as a standalone server, not as a domain controller. In the resulting setup, every user has his own home directory accessible via the SMB protocol and all users have a shared directory with read-/write access. (...)" 




####  [Linux.com/Robert Haas: Using Replication in PostgreSQL 9.0 ](http://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/377071:using-replication-in-postgresql-90)




"The recent PostgreSQL 9.0 release offers several significant improvements to PostgreSQL's built-in replication solution. Ready to add replication to your PostgreSQL install? It's easier than you might think.  

  

 Replication is a key technology for any database offering, because databases are typically mission-critical systems. Downtime ” or, worse yet, data loss ” can result not only in inconvenience to employees and customers but also in lost productivity and lost revenue. By replicating from a primary server, or master, to one or more secondary servers, sometimes called standbys, the probability of data loss or extended downtime can be greatly reduced. (...)"

"Adding files to a SVN server is usually a task done in seconds. However, having several independent SVN repositories and wanting to combine them, this is not trivial”especially if you want to preserve the history.  

  

 The doc team had had three different, independent repositories on BerliOS (opensuse-ha-doc, opensuse-docmaker, and opensuse-lfl) all holding separate information. This was a bit silly, so my task was to consolidate them into [opensuse-doc](https://developer.berlios.de/projects/opensuse-doc/) by _keeping_ all history. (...)"

 What is not so good are some comments that oppose need for [DKMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Kernel_Module_Support).   

  

 Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) ideals are nice, and very special word in that name is Free, like freedom. Creating obstacles that will limit users ability to use what works for them will not help us, nor FOSS. We can recommend opensource software and install it by default, but we can't make sure that it works for everyone, in which case giving that as the only choice is forcing users to give up on Linux, or go elsewhere. Does that help to build user base? (...)"

 First of all, last Tuesday I endured the ritual stabbing that seems to be required for travel to Brazil (I'm going to Lationware). I'm rather proud of the fact that I didn't feint or anything (I did last time I had an injection) - less happy with the fact that I still have two sour arms and am expected to get flu-like symptoms over the weekend. Which have already started - I feel worse and worse by the hour. Yay. Expect delays in communication with me this weekend, sorry... (...)"

 I'm not some guy writing Linux articles on a Windows box or a Mac. I "live Linux" exclusively, every-single-day. And I have done this for years.  

  

 That said, I™ve put myself into the position of those who are new to desktop Linux or simply overwhelmed by something within the platform.

"Koobface is a trojan that has been going around in social networking sites like “ Facebook, Twitter, MySpace etc. It originally started as a Windows only trojan. But a few days ago, a new variant emerged which can infect both Mac OS X and Linux.  

  

 Infecting a Mac or a Linux system with Koobface is quite tedious. Unlike in Windows, users need to manually download a java applet and give it the permission to run “ that should stop the trojan right there for most users. In Linux, it gets even better “ even if the applet has been allowed to run and the system has been infected, all that is needed to stop it is a simple reboot. (...)"
