The next openSUSE Board Elections have been started on December 2010 its phase 0 from three main  phases and will end with the announcement of the results on January 26, 2011.

In this election we will have 2 seats to get elected, as the election period of Pascal Bleser and Henne Vogelsang ends. Because the recent announcement of Alan Clark is the new openSUSE Board chairman! So this election the openSUSE community elects just two new members.

With the existing company affiliations in the board (Pavol Prusnak- Novell, Bryen - none, Rupert - openSLX) the restraint is that at most one of the additional elected persons can be affiliated with Novell and one with openSLX.

This time we have seven contributors and prominent candidates with different experiences and backgrounds you can check the user pages, blogs and the platform for their vision and plans:



	
  * Chuck "PUP" Payne, ambassador from the US (blog)  Platform



	
  * Sebastian â€œsebasâ€KÃ¼gler, open-slx user experience expert (blog)  Platform



	
  * Kostas Koudaras, ambassador from greece (blog)  Platform



	
  * Peter Linnell, OSS It consultant  Platform



	
  * Henne Vogelsang, Booster, Board Member, Novell (blog)  Platform



	
  * Sankar P, Programmer, Hacker, FOSS Enthusiast, Novell (blog)  Platform



	
  * Nelson Marques, Contributor (blog)  Platform


The openSUSE board was setup to lead the overall project. The main tasks for members of the board are:

Act as a central point of contact

	
  * Help resolve conflicts



	
  * Communicate community interests to Novell



	
  * Facilitate communication with all areas of the community



	
  * Facilitate decision making processes where needed.


The board should provide guidance and support existing governance structures, but shouldn't direct or control development, since community mechanisms exist to accomplish the goals of the project. The board should document decisions and policies.

The board members are elected according to some rules by the community and the chair person is appointed by Novell.

[_I think we can add Below some challenge samples or specific facts to stress the statements]_

Our actual Board  have overcome several challenges all around this period and have been set the foundations for the new openSUSE dawn in 2011. And the next Board will need some experience and willingness to help drawing the openSUSE Foundation and to facilitate the channels to take the community to the next upper levels.

At this moment, as this article is written, the elections time line shows we are on phase 1 (Campaign) [2]  During the campaign-phase there should be

plenty of blog entries on the upcoming election by the candidates

interviews with all candidates by the openSUSE news team

a moderated Q&A session on IRC #opensuse-project possibly during one of the regular Project meetings or a separate meeting

This Campaign-phase week will supersede on next January 12th to phase 2 (Election) [3]. Ballots open and all persons with voting right (every openSUSE member whose membership is valid is eligible to vote. Please verify if your email address is valid and that you are able to read emails sent to this address )  will be able to cast their votes using an comfortable frontend. The ballots will be done via web on connect.opensuse.org and will be announced on opensuse-project ( IRC channel and/or Mailing List ) and also individual mails to all members. Once a vote has been submitted it may not be changed afterwards. All votes are stored anonymously in the electronic system

And finally,the phase 2 will end on January 26th, 2011 [4] with the Ballots close (end of phase 2) with the Announcement of the results of who are to fulfill the two seats.

All phases start and end on the given dates at 12:00 UTC. For an overview what time this is in different timezones use the links above.
