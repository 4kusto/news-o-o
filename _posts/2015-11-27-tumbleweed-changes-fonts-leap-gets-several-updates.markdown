[![Tumbleweed-black-green]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Tumbleweed-black-green-300x127.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Tumbleweed-black-green.png)Tumbleweed had one snapshot so far this week that brought more appeal to users of openSUSE.

[Snapshot 20151123](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2015-11/msg00654.html) changed fonts for openSUSE. The terminal font changed to Adobe Code Pro and Roboto was also added as the default font.

The fonts are not only available in Tumbleweed; users of Leap can update the fonts as an option. The reason for the change was to provide a more appealing, complete font.

[Wireshark upgraded to 2.0](https://www.wireshark.org/news/20151118.html) in Tumbleweed and the new features are a new user interface. The legacy interface is expected to be removed in Wireshark 2.2. Wireshark’s RPM-based package definition provides the new interface in the “wireshark-qt” package and the old interface in the “wireshark-gtk” package.

Fixes were made for[ Boost version 1.59](http://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_59_0.html) and [GStreamer 1.6](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/releases/1.6/) and these two are expected to make it into a Tumbleweed snapshot soon.<!-- more -->

More updated versions are available in the snapshot and there are three new packages that were added to the reliably rolling distribution.

The three new packages added to Tumbleweed were bundle-lang-common-ca, libpoppler57 and libqpdf17.

**Leap**

Users of openSUSE [Leap 42.1](https://en.opensuse.org/Features) who update will notice several updates are available. Maintenance updates for SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 Service Pack provided updates to Samba libraries, systemd, GNOME and Java. Community fixes were also added and the Machinery Project updated to version  1.16.2.

**openSUSE Asia.Summit**

openSUSE is coming to Asia. The openSUSE Asia.Summit is Dec. 4 -6 at the National Taipei University of Education. The [schedule looks great](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/summitasia15/schedule#program) for this event. There are 46 hours worth of talks at this event. There will be 15 long-talks and 7 workshops. 

From customizing openSUSE with SUSE Studio to building laaS Cloud with openSUSE and OpenStack, this summit is something you don’t want to miss. Admission is free and you can still sign up for the event.
