Moreover, the many SUSE engineers who participate in the openSUSE community in a variety of ways will be presenting technologies they work on with the community like the Open Build Service or packaging in Factory. Finally, SUSE's openSUSE Boosters team will present some of the work they do to support the openSUSE infrastructure like [openSUSE connect](http://connect.opensuse.org) and [feature tracking tool openFATE](http://features.opensuse.org).


## Gold Sponsor NETWAYS

### Presenting "Scale-Out Datacenter Architecture"


Many changes made to modern IT infrastructure are related to scaling and increasing capacity or adjusting to specific load requirements. As many of you are probably aware, simply assigning more raw computing resources to a service rarely results in the desired increase in performance. And those attempting to tune systems to quickly changing requirements at short intervals encounter many components, complex relationships and conflicting demands making their job even more challenging. On Monday the 12th at 15:00, Bernd Erk, Head of Operations at [NETWAYS](http://www.netways.de/) will [deal with these issues and concerns in detail](http://conference.opensuse.org/indico//contributionDisplay.py?contribId=151&confId=2). Taking all involved system levels into account, he will suggest best practices and strategies for the prevention and elimination of bottlenecks. He will also present an overview of the current solutions and strategies at the network, application framework and database level. Pros and cons of each solution will be covered in evaluating their potential in the modern data center. Bernd's technical expertise stretches across Systems Management, Manged Services and Software Development. He frequently publishes and presents on topics ranging from Nagios monitoring, XEN virtualization, MySQL database monitoring to performance tuning.

Being Gold sponsor means NETWAYS plays a big role in making the conference possible and they are a major reason why we were able to do the [Conference travel support program](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/07/23/travel-sponsorship-program/)!


### OpenStack Cloud Computing and kernel debugging with Bronze sponsor B1 Systems

[B1 Systems'](www.b1-systems.de) founder Ralph Dehner will talk about [using the cluster tool Pacemaker to create Virtual System Clusters](http://conference.opensuse.org/indico//contributionDisplay.py?contribId=53&sessionId=3&confId=2). He'll describe how you can then use Xen or KVM to create a high availability solution.

Christian Baumann will [discuss Open Stack based Cloud solutions](http://conference.opensuse.org/indico//contributionDisplay.py?contribId=51&confId=2). B1 Systems has extensive experience implementing OpenStack and wrote the first whitepaper on setting it up on SLES 11 SP1. Daniel Gollub and Stefan Seyfried will present on how to [employ Systemtap for kernel debugging and instrumentation](http://conference.opensuse.org/indico//contributionDisplay.py?contribId=49&sessionId=7&confId=2) and Stefan will go onstage again with Michel Rode to explain us [how to analyze kernel crash dumps](http://conference.opensuse.org/indico//contributionDisplay.py?contribId=50&sessionId=7&confId=2). Finally, in a session on [how to survive openSUSE Factory](http://conference.opensuse.org/indico//contributionDisplay.py?contribId=48&sessionId=6&confId=2), Stefan will give tips and hints on how to run a relatively stable system on the bleeding edge Factory repository.

B1 likes to have a lot of fun and will be sponsoring [**the Geek Saloon and Dance Hall**](http://conference.opensuse.org/social-event/) at oSC!

You can expect some on-the-spot organized sessions as well.
