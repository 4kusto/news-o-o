The [openSUSE Project](https://www.opensuse.org/) has a lot going on lately. The project  just released [Leap 15.3](https://get.opensuse.org/leap), had 24-hour release party in the [openSUSE Bar](https://meet.opensuse.org/bar) and opened a [survey](https://survey.opensuse.org/) to get feedback on the release of the new Leap version.

There are many other things happening and one of those is an [online open house](https://more.suse.com/openhousecz). Members of the community will have two sessions discussing openSUSE topics during [SUSE Open House CZ 2021](https://more.suse.com/openhousecz)

The event will take place on June 15 from 13:00 UTC to 17:00 UTC. Leap release manager Lubos Kocman will give a talk about how openSUSE Leap 15.3 is made and community member Jason Evans will discuss how to contribute to openSUSE. 

Participants must register for the event. 

The project also has the [openSUSE Conference](https://events.opensuse.org/) coming up from June 18 - 19. There are several talks for the conference with topics about the community, open source, new technologies, cloud computing, containers, embedded software and much more. 

Kocman will also give a talk at the conference about the [survey](https://survey.opensuse.org/) results, which is open until June 16.
