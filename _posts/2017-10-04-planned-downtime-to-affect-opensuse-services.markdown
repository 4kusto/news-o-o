![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Failgeeko-300x300.png)A scheduled power outage in the Nuremberg office will effect a number of openSUSE services from Oct. 13 at 4 p.m. (16:00 UTC) to Oct. 14Â  at 4 p.m. (16:00 UTC).

The scheduled maintenance on the building's electricity will affect most services. The only services that will be normally operating are:
- [status.opensuse.org](https://status.opensuse.org/)
- [download.opensuse.org](http://download.opensuse.org/)
- [static.opensuse.org](https://static.opensuse.org/)
- [conncheck.opensuse.org](http://conncheck.opensuse.org/)

The rest of the services will be fully online on Oct. 15. The Heroes team will try to keep you updated on the situation, and will also send a few reminders (on the [opensuse-announce mailing list](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-announce/)) before the incident.

Due to technical constraints, the above services will not be available through IPv6 during the outage.

Thank you for your understanding.
On behalf of the [openSUSE Heroes Team](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Heroes) and the SUSE-IT team.
