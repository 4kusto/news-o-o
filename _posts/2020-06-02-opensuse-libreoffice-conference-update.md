Organizers of the [openSUSE + LibreOffice Conference](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSLO) have been slightly adjusted the conference dates from the original dates of  Oct. 13 â€“ 16 to the new dates of Oct. 15. - 17.

The new dates are a Thursday through a Saturday. Participants can submit talks for the live conference until July 21 when the Call for Papers is expected to close. 

The length of the talks for the conference have also been changed. There will be a 15-minute short talk, a 30-minute normal talk and a 60-minute work group sessions to select. Organizers felt that shortening the talks were necessary to keep attendees engaged during the online conference. The change will also help with the scheduling of breaks, social video sessions and extra segments for Questions and Answers after each talk.

The live platform that will be used will allow presenters with limited bandwidth to play a talk they record should they wish not to present a live talk. The presenter will have the possibility to control the video as well as pause, rewind, fast-forward,  etc., which is built into the system. 

Organizers have online, live conference sponsorship packages available. Interested parties should contact ddemaio (at) opensuse.org for more information.
