From [openFATE's](//features.opensuse.org) launch in January '09 the addition of a new feature was limited to [openSUSE members](https://users.opensuse.org/membership/list). Due and thanks to several requests out of the openSUSE community we changed this and are happy to announce today that openFATE now allows feature requests for non-members as well. This will lower the bar again to participate directly in the project and in the development of openSUSE, openSUSE Build Service and openFATE itself. 
We're looking forward to receive more qualified feature requests to make our openSUSE distribution and the project itself fit your needs better from day to day. To use openFATE please check first  [here](//en.opensuse.org/OpenFATE/Documentation)

Have a lot of fun!
