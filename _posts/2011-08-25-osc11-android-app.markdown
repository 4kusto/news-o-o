As we continue to work towards making this years [conference](/category/project/events/osc/) the best ever, there's one cool new thing we've never done before: Introducing the [openSUSE Conference App](https://market.android.com/details?id=org.opensuse.conference.osc11) for your Android phone. With this app you'll be able to:



	
  * Look at the daily timetable of sessions

	
  * Read the abstracts for each session

	
  * Mark the ones you want to attend and/or set an alarm to remind you

	
  * Get a refreshed version of the schedule whenever you want

![OSC11 App QR Code](/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/conf_app_qr.png)With a small space footprint this app won't make a dent on your phone but it will make a great impact on your conference experience!  And with free wi-fi at the venue, you'll be able to sync your app even when you're too far away from your home calling area.

Some user experience tips for you:



	
  * Swipe left and right to see different room schedules

	
  * Long-hold down on a session to mark the session and/or set your alarm notification

	
  * Hit the refresh button at least once a day to get any updated schedule changes


Hope you'll find the application useful, get it from the market!
