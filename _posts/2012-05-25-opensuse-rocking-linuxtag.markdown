LinuxTag in Berlin is still going and openSUSE is _having a lot of fun_ at the event. At our booth we feature daily talks about ownCloud (13:00-14:00), AppArmor (15:00-16:00) and if you were there Thursday a talk about color management and related tools.

You can also come by for our [Old Toad beer](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Beer) and of course for openSUSE DVD's, flyers, stickers and all the answers to your questions. We sorry to not have t-shirts this year but we promise to do better next year. So, come by the booth and talk to us!

Last but not least, if you are **not at LinuxTag**, either because it's a long walk from where you are or you can't make it due to other responsibilities - openSUSE has a nice treat for you. A team of Geeko's is busily recording talks at LinuxTag, encoding them and putting them on our blip and youtube channels! That's right, you can watch a selection of LinuxTag talks on [blip.tv](http://blip.tv/opensuse) and on our [openSUSE TV channel on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/opensusetv). Enjoy!
