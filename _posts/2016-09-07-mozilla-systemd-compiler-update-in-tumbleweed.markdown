![vector chameleon]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/vector-chameleon-213x300.png)[QtCon](https://qtcon.org/), [Akademy](https://akademy.kde.org/) and [VideoLAN Dev Days](https://www.videolan.org/videolan/events/vdd16/index.html) in Berlin this past week kept many developers busy, but [openSUSEâ€™s rolling release](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) kept going forward.

Tumbleweed had one new snapshot since that [last article](https://news.opensuse.org/2016/09/02/tumbleweed-enhances-encryption-updates-virtualbox-plasma/) was published and more is expected this week.

Snapshot [20160901](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-09/msg00131.html) provided Mozilla updates for both Firefox and Thunderbird in the repositories. [Firefox updated to version 48.0.2](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/48.0.2/releasenotes/) and [Thunderbird to version 45.3.0.](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/releases/)

The [GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/) updated to version 6.2.1, [systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) added some subpackages and [python-setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools) updated from version 23.1.0 to 26.1.1. Python provided the most updates for the snapshot. The snapshot was a complete rebuild of the distro, so there several package updates needed to be install.

For Tumbleweed users anticipating gblibc 2.24, the package is working its way through staging phases, may be in the next snapshot.

[GNOME 3.22](https://wiki.gnome.org/ThreePointTwentyone/ReleaseNotes) is being Integrated into openSUSE Factory this week; the integration process into Tumbleweed is uncertain. Three weeks of staged testing for 3.22 is expect.
