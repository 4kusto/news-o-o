      [openSUSE Conference CfP deadline extended](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/07/11/opensuse-conference-cfp-deadline-extended/)
    

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/rwx3b-300x123.png)

Over the last month the conference team has received a large number of proposed sessions
      for the openSUSE conference. However, we also realize we have not entirely capitalized on the
      potential for especially the ˜interactive™ sessions we wanted. So we extend the deadline with
      two weeks to allow more BoF, Workshop and Hack sessions to be submitted. And we™ll release
      some more articles to explain what we want!

**Interactive**

As we wrote in the initial [call for papers](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/05/16/opensuse-conference-2011-to-be-creative-and-open/), it is our ambition to make the openSUSE conference about community
      and getting things done. Two-way communication, not one-way! Interactivity, creativity, fun.
      The awesome [Zentrifuge](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_Location_Zentrifuge) location is there to inspire us and we choose the subtitle of **rwxÃ½**, commonly known as the UNIX acronym for Read, Write, Execute for our conference.

More importantly, we asked for ˜interactive session proposals™. And that is also where we
      failed a bit. Not everyone in openSUSE is familiar with workshops, BoFs or Hack sessions. We
      introduced [the
        BoF in an article](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/06/14/opensuse-conference-and-rw-sessions-the-bof/) but the other sessions have not seen any explanation besides what
      can be found on the [speaker guideline page](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_Planning_2011_guidelines_for_speakers).

**So more time and explanation**

In short, the four sessions explained:

  * **BoF** “ Birds of a Feather. Basically means ˜members
          of a team. Can be best described as an informal team meeting to discuss a variety of
          things and make decisons. ([article desribing the BoF](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/06/14/opensuse-conference-and-rw-sessions-the-bof/))

  * **Workshop** “ teaching session. In a workshop, a number
          of participants sit down to learn in a hands-on manner (via exercises) a particular skill
          like packaging or testing an application and submitting a bugreport.

  * **Hack Session** “ coding session. A group of
          developers/packagers/artist/writers/etc gets together to get a particular job done. For
          example to get certain packages build, a feature integrated or a document written.

In the coming two weeks we will release articles on giving a workshop and leading a hack
      session. We hope that this will inspire you all to come up with good ideas and help you
      organize, plan and [send in a session
        for the openSUSE conference](http://conference.opensuse.org/indico//conferenceDisplay.py?confId=2)!

Watch this space for the write-ups on workshops and hack sessions and read [this
        article about the BoF](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/06/14/opensuse-conference-and-rw-sessions-the-bof/) to find out how to best organize a team meeting!

**Send your Proposals**

Once you™ve identified what you™d like to do at the conference, [send in a
        proposal](http://conference.opensuse.org/indico//conferenceDisplay.py?confId=2). Don™t worry about your skills and if you™re good enough, nor about if you
      can finance the trip. If you WANT to do it, that™s enough! We™ll provide support at the
      conference in leading the sessions and we also will have travel sponsorship available for
      those tight on mony, watch this space for news on that soon.

**Helping Out**

On a sidenote, the conference team is still looking for help! If you want to get involved
      and help us make the openSUSE conference possible, please subscribe to the team mailinglist:
        [opensuse-conference@opensuse.org](mailto:opensuse-conference@opensuse.org) and checkout the planning page.

      [openSUSE and RW Sessions ” The Workshop](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/07/13/opensuse-and-rw-sessions-the-workshop/)
    

In our last article focusing on openSUSE Conference sessions,Â [we
        discussed the BoF](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/06/14/opensuse-conference-and-rw-sessions-the-bof/). In today™s article, we™ll explore the why, what and how of a
      workshop.

**Teach Them To Fish**

Remember how it is better to teach a man to fish than to bring him food? This is exactly
      what a workshop is all about. You can choose to be a one-man show doing all the work yourself,
      or you can teach others to join in with you and make your particular software project even
      stronger. And with our RWXÂ³ theme, the openSUSE Conference is the perfect host for your
      workshop.

**What happens in a workshop?**

![](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3629/3380846039_2f6eb6ca5e.jpg)

Unlike the BoF, which is a free-form event focusing on a specific topic or set of topics,
      a workshop is more rigid and provides a specific roadmap and expected goals upon the
      completion of the session. 

For example, at the openSUSE conference a series of workshops on packaging on OBS will be
      done by Lars Mueller, Pascal Bleser and several other packaging masters. At the end,
      participants know how to build a package properly on OBS and how to submit it to a devel
      project.

Commonly, a workshop at a FOSS event usually is a hands-on lab environment providing
      step-by-step instructions and exercises. You may even have a series of workshops targeting
      specific levels of expertise. However, you shouldn™t assume that all workshops are hands-on
      lab style. They can be discussion-type or training, such as a workshop that goes through a
      series of exercises on how to be an effective presentation speaker.

If you™re a developer, project manager, or team lead, there™s a good chance that a
      workshop can fit exactly what you need in order to expand the effectiveness of your
      project.

**Designing Your Workshop**

**Planning:**

You need to plan ahead and have a clear vision of what you want your audience to know by
      the time your workshop is completed. The most important factor to keep in mind is the
      available time needed to accomplish your goal. You may be tempted to dump a lot of knowledge
      onto your audience within a short time-frame, but that usually backfires in the long
      run.

In the Virtualization workshop at the openSUSE conference, Bruno Friedman has decided to
      focus on just one of the major VM technologies: KVM. Explaining them all simply doesn™t work
      in one hour.

Things to consider in relation to time are: Amount of actual time, presentation time (how
      much time it takes for you to lecture), exercise time (how much time it takes for your
      audience to complete exercises), Q&A time, and preparing for the unexpected (egads!
      There™s no network connectivity in this room?!?).

**Identify Your Audience**

Make sure you are clear about what audience you wish to have in your workshop. Do you want
      to teach users how to use your software? Do you want to teach developers how to code and
      submit patches for your software? Do you want to teach packagers tips and tricks for good
      packaging methods?

**Be Clear**

![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2612/3692413196_3f0c97c1bf_m.jpg)

Once you™ve identified your time frame, audience, and goals, it is important to be clear
      about what you can do within those constraints. It can be very tempting to cram a lot of
      information into such a short period of time, but usually your audience won™t be able to
      retain all those details. In fact, if you really need to give lots of information, consider
      breaking it up into a series of workshops where your audience can gradually learn at
      increasing levels.

Depending on your time frame, consider the top most important things your audience should
      learn. If it is a one-hour workshop, try to limit this to three things. If it is a two-hour
      workshop, consider maybe 5 things to learn. If four hours¦ well you get the drift here.

For the packaging workshop the focus is on three things: how to get a basic package
      building for openSUSE, how to create a merge request for a devel project, and how to manage
      and guide that request so the merge is successful.

If you want to provide more information than you have time for, consider giving handouts
      that explain information in depth, point to articles or resources on the web, or create
      take-home exercises that your audience can do in their own time.

**Identify Resources**

![](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4002/4589560952_c3fcc4b575_m.jpg)

Once you have determined what you want to do in these workshops, you need to identify the
      resources required to make the workshop effective. Are computers needed? If so, should the
      audience bring their own laptops or will you provide them? If you provide them, what do you
      need to do to prepare those machines? If your audience brings a laptop, what do they need to
      have on their machines?

For the VM workshop you will need to have a KVM capable kernel and a virtual image (made
      in SUSE Studio) will be provided. The team for the packaging workshop has prepared source
      tarballs and links to git repositories to be build on OBS.

Another question is what you, giving a workshop, need to bring. Are handouts required?
      What kind of information is required in those handouts? Will you be able to print them in time
      for the event? Will you be giving a slide presentation throughout your workshop? Is a
      projector needed?

Finally, think about access to the network or internet during your workshop and if you
      should provide necessary software by passing around USB keys? This is something the conference
      organization can help you with, of course! But you will have to let us know in time¦

### Tip

Use SUSE Studio to create a fully set-up development environment and add a link to the
          image in your workshop description. The conference team would be happy to have this as
          addition once the workshop is approved.

Clearly identifying all your resource needs ahead of time will make the workshop run
      much more smoothly.

**Clarity**

In your abstract, be very clear about what your workshop will achieve. If the abstract
      does not match the actual workshop as closely as possible, your audience may end up being
      disappointed, no matter what they learn. Set forth the goals and expected outcome of your
      workshop and make sure they know what they need to bring, if anything, to the workshop. Here™s
      an example of an abstract.



In this workshop, you will learn techniques for creating
            awesome videos using professional-grade software available on your Linux desktop.
            Together, we will use footage provided by the lecturer to edit and join scenes together
            to create dazzling montages worthy of a Cannes Film Festival.
        

Students must bring their own laptop and be able to connect to
            the internet through a browser. Also, the following software should be installed on your
            machine prior to the workshop: Cinelerra, foo-x, foo-y, foo-z.
        

Prerequisite: A basic knowledge of video
          editing.



**Practice Makes Perfect**

![](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/5409916350_3d88a8acab_m.jpg)

There is nothing worse than an unprepared workshop. You should practice your workshop
      lectures and exercises before beginning your session. Sit down through the exercise steps and
      make sure they are clear to your audience.

Make sure your entire workshop fits within your allotted time-frame. Chances are, you™ll
      need to make some adjustments before you arrive at your session. Review all materials and ask
      colleagues to review with you. Consider utilizing the resources of the openSUSE Conference
      Team. We have volunteers willing to help with reviewing your workshop!

**Benefits**

As you can see, designing a workshop does require a bit of preparation. But the rewards of
      your workshop will far outweigh the time you put into the design. If you™re teaching users how
      to make the best of your software, you can ensure long-term popularity for your project. If
      you™re teaching developers, you can expand your contributor base, thus improving the potential
      for your software. And most importantly, we™ll do our best to promote your workshop at our
      Conference.

So, consider submitting a proposal for a workshop at the openSUSE Conference. Even if you
      have an idea but aren™t sure how to plan for a workshop, submit your proposal. Our Conference
      Team will be more than happy to advise, assist, review or provide any other resources you
      need. After all, every good proposal starts with an idea. :-)

      [openSUSE Conference registration open!](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/07/14/opensuse-conference-registration-open/)
    

The organization team is excited to announce the registration for the openSUSE Conference,
      from September 11 to 14 in Nürnberg, is now open. Head over toÂ cur registration formÂ and
      register to help us plan for a great event.

It is time to start preparing your trip to Nuremberg!

**Preparations**

Two months from now the openSUSE and SUSE Labs Conference will kick off in Nuremberg,
      Germany. That means, as flights don™t get cheaper, you have to start planning! Ask your boss
      for some days off, start telling your professor you won™t be there from September 11-14. Start
      looking for a reasonable flight or train fare,Â [book a hotel](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_hotels)and then you™re
      ready toÂ [register
        for the conference](http://conference.opensuse.org/indico/confRegistrationFormDisplay.py?confId=2). Of course, be sure you haveÂ [submitted a session](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/07/14/opensuse-conference-registration-open/news.opensuse.org/2011/05/16/opensuse-conference-2011-to-be-creative-and-open/)Â if you want to give a talk, organize a BoF (team meeting), lead
      a hack session or give a workshop.

**Hotel**

The openSUSE conference team has madeÂ [a list of hotels](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_hotels)Â where you
      can book your stay for the duration of the conference. It is recommended to use these hotels
      as they will not only have fellow geekos in them but are also reasonably priced (special
      conference prices!) and not too far from our location,Â [Zentrifuge](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_Location_Zentrifuge).

**Travel Support**

For some of you, the trip to Nuremberg is financially not easy. You might be a student, or
      have to fly in all the way from India. We know that very well and it is the main reason why
        weÂ [are
        looking very hard for sponsors](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/06/08/opensuse-conference-looking-for-sponsors/)! Within a week, you can count on an announcement of
      the what and how of travel subsidy, but rest assured that we will do everything we can to
      ensure our community members from far away or on low budget are also able to come and join
      us!

**Visa**

Another important thing to think of in time is access to Europe/Germany. We have a
      standard invitation letter you can get from us on request. For that, send a mail with some
      personal details (who you are, what you do for openSUSE, what you will do at the conf, that
      stuff) toÂ [opensuse-conference@opensuse.org](mailto:opensuse-conference@opensuse.org)Â and the team will send you one.

**Registration**

Registering makes sure there™s a badge for you at the conference, you won™t have to wait
      in line for us to create one for you on the spot. It™ll also make sure you are able to go on
      the wifi and we have a place for you at the party. And of course it allows us to plan better
      so it matters a lot that you register as soon as possible if you intend to come!

Please note that for the registration, you don™t have to create an account. And you will
      have to book a hotel yourself, seeÂ [this page](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_hotels)!

Last but not least, there is an option betweenÂ [two different
      tickets](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Professional_conf_ticket). Entrance is free for all but those who want to support the conference and can
      afford it can buy a professional ticket. For $350 or â‚¬250 you get, besides access to the
      conference, a networking dinner with the speakers and other professional ticket holders as
      well as a session with SUSE Product Management.

**Helping out**

Meanwhile, the conference team is welcomes all the help it can get! If you want to get
      involved and help us make the openSUSE conference the best ever, please subscribe to the team
          mailinglist:Â `<[[opensuse-conference@opensuse.org](mailto:opensuse-conference+subscribe@opensuse.org)](mailto:opensuse-conference@opensuse.org)>`Â and checkout theÂ [planning page](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_Planning_2011).

This is my mid-term report for my GSoC project for the openSUSE project. As for now, I
      have a basic working web service, using Python and MongoDB. I have implemented the JSON device
      properties specification by the OpenICC group. The web service still needs improvements on
      look, and to improve error handling.

The code is available onÂ [gitorious.org/gsoc-2011/gsoc-2011\](https://gitorious.org/gsoc-2011/gsoc-2011)

The objectives are now:

  * Creating a Gnome/GTK, and a KDE client to submit and retrieve profiles
            automatically

  * Performance profiling

  * Improving look and feel

  * Improving the search algorithm

  * 100% test coverage and more testing

  * Clearing up requirements to apply for infrastructure support on the openSUSE project
            (including creating an snazzy project nameÂ

after the windows program running and exit, there will be an install entry inwindows
            boot menu, the automatic installation would follow that entry.

Work to do:

  * patch the init program so that it could recognize virtual disks which areregular
            files under widows.

  * create customized autoyast control file to support automatic installation.

Current Ptoblem:

  * the "init" program in initrd is a single binary program (in Ubuntu it's a shell
            script), which is hard to patch on the fly.

if you have any suggestion or comment, please do not hesitate to send me:)

Tasks completed:

  * Framework for the command line client including argument parser andhandlers for the
            various accessible "objects"(repos, packages, files,templates) in Suse Studio.

  * Directory management utilities: The app requires the creation andmanagement of an
            appliance directory for local caching of changesuntil ready to be pushed to
            Studio.

  * Test suite for those actions that are independent of the web API

Tasks to be completed:

  * The update, status and commit commands: These would be the commandsthat make use of
            the locally cached information from the appliancedirectory. This is the last remaining
            feature in the app.

  * Integration tests: Tests that include requests to the web API.Without tests of this
            nature it is not possible to affectively testlarge portions of the app.

  * Documentation: code level and sample use cases.

Please do [checkout the code](http://gitourious.org/ssc/ssc) and do a '$

            the appropriate repo

  * Getting familiar with the Augeas procedures,api etc

  * created a find lens procedure and created my first patch :)

  * Created the tree traversal and tree matching functions

  * Modified the augtool of Augeas, in order to be able to carry the above
            actionsÂ 

  * Created some other utility functions necessary for the above

So what is to do till the end of the GSoC:

  * Finish the matching procedures.

  * Test and work on the sysconfig lens used by Augeas.

  * Integrate the utility in opensuse

  * Finish the documentation

This is all i can think at the moment, you can find more information in the previous
      messages i sent in this list as well as in my blogÂ [http://cbounta.wordpress.com/](http://cbounta.wordpress.com/)Â I am back to work cause time is ticking and there are
      many things to be done :)Â

        Rysev: Archlinux backend for Open Build Service midterm reports](http://lists.opensuse.org/archive/opensuse-project/2011-07/msg00061.html)
    

Sorry for the long silence, I had some problems with my health, butnow all is ok.This mail
      is brief midterm report for Â«Archlinux backend for OBSÂ».

What is done:

  * Arch module for build which can:

    * parse PKGBUILDs and extract dependencies

    * parse .PKGINFO files from .pkg.tar.?z pakages and get info about it

  * Helper script, which gets repository metadata and prints informationabout packages
            in build corresponding format (package metadata parsingfunctions are also in arch
            module, so anyone can use them if needed)

What is needed now for ability to build packages:

  * Setup build environment in init_buildsystem

  * Support for calling makepkg in build script

What is also to be done:

  * Integration into OBS

  * Documentation

You can find the code in my [repository on
        gitorious](https://gitorious.org/~madgnu/opensuse/madgnu-archlinux-build).If you have any questions or suggestions ” welcome!

      [David
        Williams: Entomologist UI Changes - Midterm Reporter](http://lists.opensuse.org/archive/opensuse-project/2011-07/msg00067.html)
    

You can find my midterm report at [http://redache.wordpress.com/2011/07/14/midterm-report-things-completed-so-far/](http://redache.wordpress.com/2011/07/14/midterm-report-things-completed-so-far/) and
      the text below. I really recommendÂ reading the blog post as it has screenshots of everything
      :).

This report is a summary of all the work that I've completed so far for myÂ Summer of Code
      and what is to come :).

Porting Entomologist to Windows and Mac OS X:Entomologist works mostly flawlessly on Mac
      OS X. Windows was an awkwardÂ platform to port for and it still doesn't function as well as it
      could but onceÂ we hit version 1.0 a lot of the problems can be addressed.

Tabbed Interface for selecting Trackers:

This took a few weeks to complete as it was awkward to get everything to workÂ correctly, I
      also had the learning curve/understanding new code slowing me downÂ whilst doing it. Overall
      I'm pretty happy with how it looks and how it works.

New Comments Dialog:

Next on the list was creating a New Comments Dialog. The goal was to make itÂ easier to
      select a bug and see the comments and add new comments for thatÂ specific bug. The dialog works
      by either highlighting a bug in the table andÂ hitting Ctrl + Shift + N(Cmd + Shift + N on a
      Mac) or by clicking the newÂ comments button in the expanded comments dialog. If no bug is
      highlighted itÂ defaults to opening the first bug in the list.

ToDo Lists:

This is probably the most helpful feature I've worked on throughout theÂ project. It has
      been a bit of a learning curve and I think I'm starting toÂ 'Get' QT and I can definitely see
      why QT is usually classed as better than GTK.Â This feature still isn't finished but it is
      nearly all there and I'm currentlyÂ working on the mechanism to add new ToDoLists. Once that's
      completed the firstÂ basic iteration will be there and it should be useful in that
      state.

Post Midterm Plans:

Post midterm I want to add cloud sync to the ToDoLists so you can sync theÂ items to
      whichever tracker you feel is appropriate. This should help in organising data and
      recordingÂ milestones through bugs :). I think I'll start by having it export to
      calendarÂ formats that can be read by normal desktop viewers and they can handle theÂ sync. But
      the plan is to add that service integration to entomologist itself.

After that work is completed I will look at how we can integrate QML intoÂ Entomologist so
      the trackers that it supports can be extended by using QML.Â This would take a lot of work away
      from Matt as he won't have to add newÂ trackers, the users that want them can use QML to define
      them and they canÂ submit them as an extension :). I think this is the best way to manage most
      bugÂ trackers as there are a lot of different ones out there.

So that's it for the work completed so far. Hopefully at the end we'll reachÂ version 1.0
      of Entomologist and move on with adding shiny new things :).

        [Michal Marek: Improved Kernel Package Retention in 12.1](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/07/14/improved-kernel-package-retention-in-12-1/)
      

A long awaited feature of the openSUSE update stack is finally here!Since some time, it
        has been possible to tell libzypp to not delete oldkernels on update:


        

multiversion = provides:multiversion(kernel)


      

inÂ /etc/zypp/zypp.conf. That way, you don™t have to
        worry that abrand new -rc kernel from Factory makes your system unbootable. This
        howeversolves one problem and brings another one “ you have to manually delete theold kernel
        so that your /boot partition does not fill up. openSUSE 12.1 willprovide a solution to this,
        you will be able to tell what kernels you want tokeep after an update, other kernels will be
        deleted. The configuration is thesame file,Â /etc/zypp/zypp.conf:


        

## Comma separated list of kernel packages to keep installed in parallel, if the
## above multiversion variable is set. Packages can be specified as
## 2.6.32.12-0.7 - Exact version to keep
## latest        - Keep kernel with the highest version number
## latest-N      - Keep kernel with the Nth highest version number
## running       - Keep the running kernel
## oldest        - Keep kernel with the lowest version number (the GA kernel)
## oldest+N      - Keep kernel with the Nth lowest version number
##
## Default: Do not delete any kernels if multiversion = provides:multiversion(kernel) is set
multiversion.kernels = latest,running



      

If you configure this and the above multiversion variable, then after eachkernel update,
        during a subsequent reboot, a script will compare the list ofinstalled kernels with the
        multiversion.kernels setting and delete those thatare no longer needed. (...)

            really makes me think we should go this way.

Ray's comment starting with "Every flicker and mode change in the boot

An easy way to remove Software! For example: you installed an application with "1-click install" (which will install all the packages that you need), there should be an easy way (also with 1 click) to remove what you have installed with that 1-click operation... in another words: an "1-click Uninstall" to remove installed software (dependencies and packages included).

Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn't
            going to go away. The code itself isn't well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It's only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don't have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

Some might remember my hackweek project Zippl. IÂ [blogged aboutÂ it](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/06/11/zippl-a-lightweigth-presentation-tool/) more than a year ago. Zippl is a lightweigt presentation
            tool, a bit likeÂ prezi, a hipp tool for that purpose, where all ˜slides™ sit on one
            large canvas and during the presentation a kind of camera moves over the canvas.

I liked the idea and did Zippl as I wanted to play with Qt™s QGraphicsView. It takes a
            simple xml file as input which describes the presentation and animates it as shown in
            the video in myÂ [older blog](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/06/11/zippl-a-lightweigth-presentation-tool/).

First I thought it doesn™t make sense to continue that project. But recently, somebody
            asked if I have built in the featureÂ back to the previous spotÂ as I promised almost a
            year ago, as he wanted to do a presentation with Zippl. I couldn™t believe, and so I
            spent an evening in the weekend to polish Zippl a bit. And because its easy with OBS, I
            quickly built an rpm package for various openSUSEs.

Now that I worked on it a bit again I found it could also make sense on tablet
            devices, for example to run coolÂ Hello New UserÂ animations or small presentations for
            ant Tilly to get some sponsorship for the new bike. Could be fun.If you want to check

      [Linux Journal/Michael
        Reed: Linux Gaming: OpenClonk](http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/linux-gaming-openclonk)
    

Until recently, I had presumed that a Clonk was the sound that my hard drive made just
      before I realized that I hadn't backed it up properly. However, in this case, a Clonk is a
      tiny chap who can jump, climb and fire weapons in the service of reaching his
      goal.Â OpenClonkÂ runs on Linux and is the latest in a series of side-view platform games that
      started life as a DOS shareware series.

![](http://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/ufiles/u1013687/openclonk2_resize.jpg)

Although, superficially, [OpenClonk](http://www.openclonk.org/) could be
      classified as a platform game, the pace is thoughtful rather than breakneck. It borrows its
      control system from first person shooters, and the familiar WASD key cluster is teamed with
      mouse control for movement and aiming respectively.

The graphics make use of 3D hardware rendering even though the view is strictly side-on
      and 2D. Although it makes use of 3D acceleration, it doesn't need a powerhouse graphics card
      to run, and it rendered perfectly well on my Core Duo with integrated Intel graphics chipset.
      I suspect it would have run even more smoothly with a lesser processor and a more powerful,
      dedicated graphics card.

**Along with better support for new chipsets and graphics cores from
        AMD and Intel, not to mention drivers for Microsoft's Kinect and DVB-T2, Linux 3.0 once
        again offers a number of workarounds for a wide range of hardware
      problems.**

In the opening minutes of Tuesday morning, Linus Torvalds released another pre-release
      version of Linux 3.0. In hisÂ release mail, Linus says that "Things have been pretty quiet, but
      there's enough new stuff here that I wanted to do another -rc". The developer had previously
      said that the sixth release candidate might perhaps have been the last.

Should Torvalds not issue another rc, Linux 3.0 could appear later this week or early next
      week. As Linux 3.0 slowly nears completion, the kernel log finishes the "Coming in 3.0"
      mini-series with a description of changes to drivers, including those for audio, graphics,

[Linus Torvalds: Linux
      3.0-rc7](https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/7/11/427)

I think I said -rc6 might be the last -rc. I lied.

Things have been pretty quiet, but there's enough new stuff here thatI wanted to do
      another -rc, and we still have some issues with the RCUchanges causing problems when RCU
      events happen before the schedulerhas been fully initialized etc. So -rc7 is out there,
      although itmight not have mirrored out to the public sites quite yet.

I also ended up re-generating the -rc6 files (fat-fingered the releasescript), so the -rc6
      patches and tar-balls look all brand spanking newtoo! Two releases for the price of
      one!

There's not a whole lot to say about it - the appended shortlog givesa reasonable
      overview. Random drivers (we're back to the usual "twothirds drivers" statistics), some media
      and cifs updates, and somevmscan corner case improvements. Linus

One of digiKam™s lesser known features is the ability to link scripts to notifications. At first sight, this may seem like a rather obscure functionality, but it can be put to some clever uses. Say, you want to keep a portfolio of selected photos on a mobile device. Resizing multiple photos to a specified size to make it easier to view them on the mobile device and transferring the processed photos from digiKam to the mobile device manually is not very practical. And this is where the ability to trigger scripts via notifications can come in handy. You can attach a simple Bash script to the Batch queue completed notification, so it™s triggered automatically when the Batch Queue Manager tool is done processing photos. (...)

SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., July 13 2011 “ The Linux Foundation, the nonprofit organization
        dedicated to accelerating the growth of Linux, today announced that four new members are
        joining the organization: basysKom, Codero, Gluster and Nixu Open.

These four companies represent the diverse environments in which Linux is accelerating

As usual I ran into a couple more issues this past week that prevented me from
        completing many of the items on my Todo list. I also forgot to finish a couple of things
        like copying files, because it isn™t part of the web frontend.

First, I™d like to take some time responding to Lukas™sÂ commentÂ to last week™s post.
        I™ve spent a while debating whether or not to store all file records in the database or
        continue with the current solution with only recording folders and any files that differ
        compared to their parent folder. I™ve decided that it is best to stick with current solution
        because ownCloud isn™t designed nor wants to support a large number of users, but only small
        groups. Lukas also suggested some additional permissions or rules instead of the current
        read or write. Well, protected files are what every user has in their own directory. Private
        files with links are what the public link app can already do using a token for the link.
        Eventually this will be part of sharing files and offer the same functionality in one
        interface. Shared files right now are pulled directly out of the owner™s file system, but
        you have limited power when dealing with those files and can™t physically delete them, only
        unshare the files from yourself. Creating copies of the files would require a huge rewrite
        and it doesn™t seem to be worth the effort. If you™re still confused about how sharing files
        work and where your files are going please continue to ask questions. (...)

Though netbooks have waned a bit in favor of tablet devices, there's still a lot of
        demand for netbooks and netbook-friendly Linux distros in certain circles. Whether you're
        looking for a brand-new netbook or to keep an older device current, there's plenty of
        options for the Linux crowd. Let's take a look at the top five netbook Linux distros.

A lot has happened in the last year for netbook distributions, and there have been quite
        a few changes in our selection for 2011 compared toÂ [the 2010 line-up of best Linux netbooks.](http://www.linux.com/news/embedded-mobile/netbooks/308465-five-best-linux-netbook-oses-for-now)

What happened? Well, a couple of releases that weren't quite ready for release yet
        finally hit the shelves. On top of that, a few releases sort of disappeared. TheÂ [gOS release](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOS_%28operating_system%29)Â went
        offline and is now considered discontinued. Puppy Linux is still going strong, but with the
        current crop of netbook releases, it didn't look quite as attractive this year as one of the
        suggestions.

Ready for this year's list? Let's get started with the most likely suspect, Ubuntu.
