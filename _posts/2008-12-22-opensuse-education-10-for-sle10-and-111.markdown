The first version of the openSUSE-Education Add-on is drawing to a close. By releasing the [final version](http://www.opensuse-education.org/download/repo/1.0/SLE10/) for SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 and the first Release Candidate for 11.1, we hopefully have the **first community Add-On media which is available for each (open)SUSE Release**, soon!

The only thing left to reach this great goal: fix the [last bugs](http://devzilla.novell.com/education/buglist.cgi?query_format=specific&order=relevance+desc&bug_status=__open__&product=openSUSE-Education+1.0+for+11.1&content=) for the openSUSE 11.1 release!

So please help us releasing a bugfree openSUSE-Education release 1.0 for 11.1 in the next days by [testing and reporting bugs](http://devzilla.novell.com/education/enter_bug.cgi?classification=All&product=openSUSE-Education+1.0+for+11.1&submit=submit) in our bugzilla. (Note: The next release should be the final one for 11.1 - and the completion of our 1.0 version.)

You can either use our [Online-Repository](http://www.opensuse-education.org/download/repo/1.0/11.1/) by adding it via the "Community-Repositories" Section in YaST or via the "Add-on"-YaST module - or use the [ISO-Image](ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/education/openSUSE-Education-1.0-for-11.1.iso) (2.6GB) as "non online" version. Both contain the same packages.

The RC1 release contains a lot of package updates (and fixes) - a complete [Changelog for all packages](http://www.opensuse-education.org/download/repo/1.0/11.1/ChangeLog) is available in the root-directory of our installation source. There are still 10 packages left in the Build ServiceÂ  which needs fixes to build for 11.1 - hopefully we get them fixed soon enough for the final release.
