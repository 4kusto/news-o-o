[![13.1-Milestone1](//news.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/13.1-Milestone1.png)](//news.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/13.1-Milestone1.png)
openSUSE is pleased to announce that the newest Milestone for the upcoming version of openSUSE 13.1. is available for testing. As early version, it is expected that this Milestone is not fully functional or very stable and we welcome bug reports and fixes for the issues. This is the first in a series of upcoming updates to the distribution that will end with the final release of 13.1 projected by November of 2013.Â As usual with an alpha release, the most prominent changes in openSUSE 13.1 Milestone 1 come from the upgrades that packages are going through.

## Most Annoying Bugs


The list of [most annoying bugs](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Most_annoying_bugs_13.1_dev) is still short. We're looking towards _you_ to help us make that list bigger! We need to find out what's wrong so we can fix it. You can [report bugs with this link](https://bugzilla.novell.com/enter_bug.cgi?&product=openSUSE%2012.3&cf_foundby=Beta-Customer). The process of reporting bugs involves a couple of steps that you can take in order to contribute with the distribution. Reporting bugs and problems with the packages is essential for openSUSE to retain its stability. Please review our sections on [how to contribute to factory](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:How_to_contribute_to_Factory), and [submitting bug reports](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Submitting_bug_reports).

You're more than welcome to organize some bug-finding-and-squashing sessions! Take a look at previous efforts in our last [beta-pizza-party!](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/09/06/opensuse-celebrates-beta-1-with-pizzabeta-parties/)


## Planned Changes


Some time ago, the team posted a suggested list of changes for openSUSE 13.1. The idea behind this is to accept the changes provided by the community and at the same time meet specific team goals. Please keep in mind that this list is subject to change but it helps when understanding where the next release of openSUSE would like to go.

For the base system, planned changes include updating GCC to version 4.8 and working on the latest integrations for the Linux Kernel. On booting there was a discussion looking to completely move to SYSTEMD and dropping SYSVINIT. Replacing MKINITRD with [Dracut](http://www.techradar.com/us/news/software/operating-systems/what-on-earth-is-dracut-1078647).

On the KDE environment the planned list includes making PHONON support GSTREAMER 1.0 and replacing Kopete, largely unmaintained now, to KDE Telepathy. Gnome is also looking to change a few things in 13.1 starting by adding Gnome 3.10, cleaning out some outdated libraries and changing its default theme to a greener one.

On security the list is simple so far, AppArmor will be promoted further as a preferred security suite and updating SELinux.


### Get involved!


This list of possible changes can also be altered by your participation. If you are a developer looking to learn and participate of the openSUSE project through coding, packaging or coordinating efforts to include certain software on the distribution, go to our [factory page](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Factory) and learn more about how to contribute code. The process of working packages into the factory release is also documented in an article for the release of openSUSE 12.3. If you are interested in making contributions for packages, please go [here](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/09/27/get-your-package-in-factory-for-12-1/) and get packaging! Although the link is for 12.3, keep in mind that the packaging process done on 13.1 is the same. If your are familiar with branching projects through GIT, making contributions to the factory development should be easy for you. In simple words, you access the openSUSE repository, branch the specific part you would like to work on, make the appropriate updates and then you make requests to our team to include your changes.

However, the work on openSUSE is not only belonging or limited to packaging. There is far more that can be done here. Marketing, team coordination, translation, artwork, etc. These are simple examples of what more of you could be doing for the team. If you are willing to participate, take a look at this [page](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:How_to_participate) and choose!
