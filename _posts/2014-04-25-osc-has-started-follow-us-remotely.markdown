The openSUSE Conference 2014 in Dubrovnik was kicked off just an hour ago by the board, sharing some practical information with those in attendance, a call for help as well as a number of community announcements. Talks will be available via streaming during the event, make sure to check it out!

The board brought up the state of openSUSE, including the release cycle (what comes after 13.1 is not clear yet), the changes to our processes (staging projects, openQA testing integration) and so on. This conference is a great time and place to discuss these things.


## Announcements






	
    * The openSUSE Conference 2015 will take place in The Hague, Netherlands!



Under leadership of Hans de Raadt, a local team will take care of us in the international city of peace and justice. More details on Sunday!




	
    * Reimbursement of production of local materials is back!



A process is being set up, led by a committee under Jim Henderson. More info will follow soon!

And the Board urged everybody to have fun and learn a lot!

## Practical


For those at the event: don't forget to return the food card and pay so you get something to eat today, tomorrow and on Sunday!

And a reminder: the conference party on Sunday evening starts at 7:00 P.M. (19:00) at the [EastWest Pub](http://ew-dubrovnik.com/), which is located right at the beach at Frana Supila 4. The pub is just south of the old town and it takes about 15 to 20 minutes to walk there from the venue. [On the way](http://goo.gl/maps/yUoGN) you will pass Sesame where everything starts on Thursday evening.
