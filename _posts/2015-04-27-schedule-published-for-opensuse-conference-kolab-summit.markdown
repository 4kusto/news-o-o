In just a few days, Geekos will kick off the [openSUSE Conference](http://bit.ly/OSCingit) in The Hague, Netherlands.

There is much to be excited about for this year’s annual conference. [Markus Feilner](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/osc15/proposal/648), a seasoned Linux expert, will open up the conference with a keynote speech in the morning on May 1.

[Richard Brown](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/osc15/proposal/610) will follow that with a presentation titled “Super Secret SUSE Project”; that’s presentation you’re not going to want to miss.

Later that afternoon, [Aaron Seigo](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/osc15/proposal/600) will have his keynote speech, which is bound to be equally intriguing.

‎There will be four rooms used during the event and system administrators will have a chance in one of those rooms try out a new systems management toolkit for Linux from [Project Machinery](http://bit.ly/1IeH3As).

<!-- more -->The four-day event can be viewed at [https://events.opensuse.org/conference/osc15/schedule](http://bit.ly/1FFdKaz), but that is not the only schedule for oSC15.

The Kolab Summit will coincide on Saturday and Sunday with oSC15 and Kolab’s Chief Executive Officer [Georg Greve](https://conference.kolab.org/kolab-summit/sessions/keynote-road-ahead-kolaboration) will be providing the summit’s keynote speech on May 2.

The schedule for the summit can be viewed at [https://conference.kolab.org/kolab-summit/program/schedule](http://bit.ly/1DPGMxv).

Having oSC15 together with the Kolab Summit provides a great opportunity for attendees to collaborate and strengthen its existing developers relationship.

There will be a social event on Saturday and Sunday and a good sources tells me there will be some openSUSE Beer at the event.

For those who are unable to make it to the event, the presenations will be viewable at [https://www.youtube.com/user/opensusetv](https://www.youtube.com/user/opensusetv). Follow us on [Facebook](http://on.fb.me/1PLITL6), [Google +](http://bit.ly/1QzT9Yp) and [Twitter](http://bit.ly/1sKeOgJ).
