[The Green
        Planet](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/11/07/the-green-planet/)

The last few days those of you linked to the planet by [http://planetsuse.org/](http://planetsuse.org/) are experiencing connection problems. This is not because
      openSUSE Planet is down but as Pascal Bleser announced a few days ago into the openSUSE
      Project ML because this domain name is not under the Project™s control but by and individual
      who left the openSUSE Project some years ago. 

The only way to go to the openSUSE planet is now by typing http://planet.opensuse.org/ and
      the correct way to connect your RSS is by adding [that](http://planet.opensuse.org/global/rss20.xml) .xml . 

In case you are experiencing troubles with your aggregator please contact
      admin@opensuse.org there is someone there to help you solve any problem you might have.

[Geekos go on
      G+](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/11/08/geekos-go-on-g/)

The IT world moves fast and along with it does social networking. It™s been only a few
      days since Google [announced](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/11/google-pages-connect-with-all-things.html) the limited availability of Google+ pages and already thousands of
      Google-plussers have created a Google+ page. Of course, we™re social too and thus the openSUSE
      project now has an official Google+ page!

If you are created a page for an openSUSE community, like Kostas for the Greece
      community, then don™t forget to add your page to [openSUSE Social
        media contacts](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Social_media_contacts#Social_networks) so that openSUSE enthusiasts can easily [find the official pages and add it](http://gpc.fm/l/opensuseusers) to their
      circles. That page is also a reference for other social media activities that openSUSE is
      involved in like Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn.

Also, if you like to get involved promoting openSUSE on social media and networks, please
      talk with the openSUSE marketing team.

I™d like to thank Roger Luedecke for taking care of the new openSUSE Google + page and
      invite everybody to share contents on it, promote it and follow what we do!

      [Continuous Integration testing for openSUSE available!](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/11/10/continuous-integration-testing-for-opensuse-available/)
    

The development process of the Open Build Service (OBS) code base as well as it™s
      accompanying tools is largely test-driven. Major parts of the OBS source code are covered by a
      comprehensive test-suite. Traditionally, after each new code submission, these tests have been
      run by a custom shell-script on a local machine that wasn™t publicly available for several
      reasons. Even though this setup served us well for a long time, but we needed more. We want to
      provide a more transparent solution that allows the community to participate and maybe take
      over some responsibilities. Thus, your hard-working OBS-team hereby kindly introduces
      ci.opensuse.org, our new public interface for continuous integration (CI) testing!

First of all i would like to apologise for all this period of time that i didnt
          respond to the mails . I have just return back from the "Libre Software World Conference"
            ([http://www.libresoftwareworldconference.com/](http://www.libresoftwareworldconference.com/)) and i'm a bit tired. 

Secondly , Stathis thanks for your wish. It's a very interesting idea that you want to
          lead the project. 

Furthermore , Eric i think that you are able to take part in one or more sections of
          the Project. As well in the traslation and also in the "other piece of stuff" available. 

I would like to thank as well for the article that you posted in the mailing list the
          last days, it's really interesting. 

Stathis : From now on you can Lead the Project and you are the new openSUSE Medical
          Leader!! Congratulations! I think that you will do the best!! Go ahead!!! 

I would like to say that i give up from the project but i will try to contribute in
          translation and maybe in packaging. Thanks a lot guys!

I wanted to open a fate feature about this when I first heard of plymouth, but
            reading
            http://fedoramagazine.wordpress.com/2008/10/21/interview-fedora-10s-better-startup/
            really makes me think we should go this way.

Ray's comment starting with "Every flicker and mode change in the boot
            process takes away from the whole experience." is especially interesting. Is it
            okay to track the "don't show grub by default" here?






            [1-click uninstall (Score: 173)](https://features.opensuse.org/305305)
          

An easy way to remove Software! For example: you installed an application with "1-click install" (which will install all the packages that you need), there should be an easy way (also with 1 click) to remove what you have installed with that 1-click operation... in another words: an "1-click Uninstall" to remove installed software (dependencies and packages included).

            [Update to GRUB v2 (Score: 170)](https://features.opensuse.org/308497)
          

Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn't
            going to go away. The code itself isn't well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It's only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don't have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

We need a feedback about packages that are preferred by users and actively used. Debian already has a tool named Popularity contest (popcon)
            
          

* reusing popcon will give us results that are directly comparable with Debian and Ubuntu
          

* packagers team can take care of the package
          

* we need a configuration dialog in YaST that is visible enough
          

* we need a server infrastructure on opensuse.org. (There are certain privacy issues, see Debian FAQ for details)

            [Mate repo for openSUSE](https://features.opensuse.org/312946)
          

Around the world users still like the Gnome 2 DE. Gnome2 has forked now in to Mate DE [https://github.com/Perberos/Mate-Desktop-Environment](https://github.com/Perberos/Mate-Desktop-Environment) , so i think that beside a kde3 repo, a Mate repo for Gnome2 users of openSUSE is needed.

            [Port Kablink to openSUSE please?](https://features.opensuse.org/312957)
          

We should port and package Kablink for openSUSE.
Kablink is the opensource version of Novell Vibe OnPrem.

[http://kablink.org/](http://kablink.org/)






            [Make the best working desktop default](https://features.opensuse.org/312959)
          

For every distribution, make the best working desktop default.
Right now, KDE is default even though it is obviously broken.
Let's decide for each release, which desktop is the best working and give that one the honor of being the default.

Which metrics to apply to decide which desktop is good working and which one is not is open to debate, we could go for things like "open bug count" for example.
Maybe we should limit the selection to "general purpose desktops" and leave out the more esoteric ones like awesome, larswm and such, but decide at least among

  * KDE

  * GNOME

  * LXDE

  * XFCE

Which are all full featured desktops ready for end users.






            [Create a repository containing security tools](https://features.opensuse.org/312960)
          

Many people are interested or working on security projects and pen testing. It would be useful to have a repository with security tools. The fedora project has already a security spin for a while, opensuse could also make a similar effort.






            [Timezone aware cron](https://features.opensuse.org/312961)
          

(...) OpenSolaris finally contains a version of cron that understands and correctly handles having different timezones. You can also specify a different home directory (useful when you don't want NFS to get involved in your cron job for any reason) and shell to run jobs in. It should be in build 106 of OpenSolaris & Nevada. (...)

            [Include acpi_osi=Linux pcie_aspm=force by default for Grub boot parameters](https://features.opensuse.org/312962)
          

acpi_osi=Linux identifies the OS to the BIOS helping fix power and other issues.

pcie_aspm=force fixes power regression issue shown here; [http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=linux_2638_aspm&num=1](http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=linux_2638_aspm&amp;num=1)






            [Netinstall from update repo](https://features.opensuse.org/312964)
          

When installing a openSUSE system from an netinstall CD it justs takes all data just out of the OSS repo so it needs an upgrade just after installation.

It would be nicer if it would take the data out of the update repo, to have an installed system which is up-to-date.






            [[autoyast] Support for priorities in addon product list](https://features.opensuse.org/312967)
          

currently you can not specify the priority for entries in the addon products list. so in a normal installation yast will then always use the latest package even though you might prefer the original distro package instead of a 3rd party repository. for this I propose a <priority> sub element in the <listentry> element.

of course it would be nice that packages could still be installed from a lower prioritized repository. for that it would be required that the package element in the packages list would have a repositories attribute that references the source repository. you could use the product or name tag as identifier.

<package repository="dlre">rubygems</package>






            [[autoyast] Option to ignore weak dependencies in packages and patterns](https://features.opensuse.org/312968)
          

zypper/zypp have an option solver.onlyRequires (see /etc/zypp/zypp.conf). it would be nice to have an equivalent option in the autoyast xml file so you can avoid getting recommended packages installed. currently you have to put all those packages into the remove-packages list, which is a bit tedious and can easily run out of sync with the distro.






            [[autoyast] more control over the naming of the /etc/zypp/repos/*repo files](https://features.opensuse.org/312969)
          

atm if you add additional repositories/products in your autoyast xml file, the resulting .repo files get named like
proto-host-somehash.repo. If you want to integrate with e.g. puppet this becomes a but cumbersome.
It would be nice if you could have an alias subelement for the listentry element which would define the name of the repo file. (using alias as term as this is what matches zypper is using in zypper lr) (...)

            Finger: Weekly News for November 12](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-testing/2011-11/msg00030.html)
        

The next meeting of the Testing Core Team will be November 28, 2011 at 18:00 UTC on
          Channel #opensuse-testing on the Freenode IRC Network
          (irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-testing). Our preliminary agenda includes an analysis of
          the 12.1 testing cycle. We hope to answer questions such as "What worked?", "What did
          not?", and "How can we improve for 12.2?". 

In our last meeting help on November 7, we discussed our experiences with 12.1 RC2,
          and what bugs we had encountered. The full meeting log is available at [http://community.opensuse.org/meetings/opensuse-testing/2011/opensuse-testing.2011-11-07-18.00.log.html](http://community.opensuse.org/meetings/opensuse-testing/2011/opensuse-testing.2011-11-07-18.00.log.html). 

As oppenSUSE 12.1 will be released before my next communication, I wish everyone a
          good installation. Three of my machines have been updated to 12.1 GM, and all are working
          quite well.

            [Klaas Freitag: Kraft 0.44
                released](http://kfreitag.tumblr.com/post/12463194435)
        

around fife month after the last release I am happy to annouce [version 0.44](http://volle-kraft-voraus.de/Main/Releases) of [Kraft](http://volle-kraft-voraus.de/), the [KDE](http://www.kde.org) software to manage business documents like
            offers and invoices in the small enterprise.

This development cycle was very much affected by work around the integration of the
                [Akonadi](http://userbase.kde.org/Akonadi) based address book. I
            have gone through a lot of cycles of tries and tests, with various combinations of KDE-
            and PIM libraries and Akonadi and Nepomuk setups. Not always the stack was transparent
            to me nor the integration of the various parts perfect. But we™re KDE with our welknown
            community, and so I finally had the pleasure to go through my and other code and fix it
            togehter with Kevin and Tobias on Desktop Summit this summer. That brought back
            motivation, thanks :-)

So now one of the strengthes of the KDE platform from the application developers POV,
            which is the availability of powerful software building blocks such as an easy
            integratable address book, is now back to Kraft and users can again fully benefit from
            it.

Apart from that I did a lot of small and larger bugfixes, for example 0.44 contains a
            full rewrite of the text template management for head- and footer texts. It contains a
            more clear UI and context sensitive help now for the users benefit.

Kraft now also comes with localized PDF templates for documents. It was possible to
            use custom templates before and there were localized ones around, but it was an
            administrative task to use them. Now Kraft picks automatically the right one depending
            on the language settings which should be a nice improvement for new users evaluating
            Kraft.

As usual I am happy to get feedback. Kraft is also very open to contributions, as in
            code, documentation, marketing bug reporting and such. Please check the [Contribution Page](http://volle-kraft-voraus.de/Main/Contribution) on
            the project website for details.





[Klaas Freitag:
            Kraft 0.45 released](http://kfreitag.tumblr.com/post/12527150375/kraft045)

A couple of days after the [release of Kraft
            0.44](http://kfreitag.tumblr.com/post/12463194435/kraft044) with new features I had to prepare a bugfix release. It™s labeled 0.45
            and was released today. It fixes a bug that prints wrong decimal places on the PDF
            documents which results in wrong calculations on the document.Ã½

That is a very severe and not acceptable bug, as the wrong documents could make it to
            a customer of a Kraft user and as a result harm the business. I apologize for any
            inconvenience.

Please skip Kraft 0.44 and use version 0.45 instead.

[Stefan
                Schubert: WebYaST 0.3 is out](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/11/07/webyast-0-3-is-out/)


            **We have doubled the speed and have halved the memory
                usage**
        

![](http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/WebYaST2_screenshot2.png)

The latest version of WebYaST has many improvements regarding speed, memory usage,
            usability and developing environment:

  * **Speed**

Due a new caching mechanism the startup time of each module has been
                        decreased to a maximum of 1-2 seconds. So the user is able now to click
                        through WebYaST without any notable waiting time. We have made a video which
                        shows the speed improvement:[ WebYaST Comparison Video](http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/webyast-comparison.swf)For more technical information have a
                        look to: [
                            WebYaST Caching Howto](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:WebYaST_Caching)

  * **Memory Usage**

Former versions of WebYaST were split into a service and into an UI part.
                        Each part has run in a own HTTP server. We have decided to bring these parts
                        together in order to save one HTTP server which halves the memory usage. One
                        additional benefit is that the architecture of WebYaST has simplified a
                        lot:

  * 
                        **Simplifying WebYaST architecture**
                    

Due the use of one HTTP WebYaST server only the development environment
                        has been simplified very much:

[Pascal Bleser: gpodder 2 vs 3 in Packman](http://dev-loki.blogspot.com/2011/11/gpodder-2-vs-3-in-packman.html)

The [gpodder](http://gpodder.berlios.de) project [introduced its
                new major release 3.0.0 today](http://blog.gpodder.org/2011/11/gpodder-300-397d-released.html) and, unfortunately, it seems like I didn't pay
            attention to the complete change announcement, as I just bumped the [gpodder package in
                Packman](http://packman.links2linux.org/package/gpodder) to 3.0.0 (from 2.18).

Now, gpodder 3.0.0 does introduce a lot of changes, notably in the UI but also
            regarding its database format and requires migrating the database from 2 to 3. It
            doesn't seem to have all of the features of 2.20 either. So what happens is that when
            you just upgrade the gpodder package, you end up with something you don't necessarily
            want to use. At least as of now. (...)

So it's been two weeks since 3.1, and you know how it works by now.

I have to say, this wasn't my favorite merge window ever. I really
wanted to take only things that had been in -next, but verifying it
was fairly painful, since a lot of the trees had been rebased, and the
ones that hadn't been rebased often had some extra patches that still
showed up when I did my "git log linux-next..FETCH_HEAD" thing.

On the whole, most of it was all good, and I didn't really end up
complaining to people. I'm pretty sure that there were trees I
shouldn't have let through, but the majority really had been in -next. (...)

        [Linux Journal/Adrian Hannah: man make: a Primer on the Make Utility](http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/man-make-primer-make-utility)
      

In a compiled language, the makefile is arguably the most important part of any programming project. To compile your project, you first have to compile each source file into an object file, which in turn needs to be linked with system libraries into the final executable file. Each command can have a considerable number of arguments added in. That's a lot of typing and a lot of potential for mistakes. The more source files you have, the more complex the compilation process becomes, unless you use makefiles. Most Linux users have at least a cursory knowledge of make and makefiles (because that's how we build software packages for our systems), but not much more than that. Most developers probably don't have too much in-depth experience with makefiles, because most Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) have the capability of managing makefiles for them. Although this is convenient most of the time, knowing more about how make works and what goes into makefiles can help you troubleshoot compilation errors down the road. (...)

        [Pavol Rusnak: Getting SSH fingerprints for machines in your network](http://stick.gk2.sk/blog/2011/11/getting-ssh-fingerprints-for-machines-in-your-network/)
      

Some time ago we were trying to get SSH fingerprints for all machines in our local
        network. Solution is not that straightforward, but it™s not a rocket science either:
        


#!/bin/bash
tmpfile=$(mktemp)
for i in $(seq 2 254); do
    ssh-keyscan -t rsa,dsa,ecdsa 192.168.1.$i > > $tmpfile
    done
ssh-keygen -l -f $tmpfile
rm -f $tmpfile
        


        


#!/bin/bash
tmpfile=$(mktemp)
for i in $(seq 2 254); do
    ssh-keyscan -t rsa,dsa,ecdsa 192.168.1.$i >> $tmpfile
done
ssh-keygen -l -f $tmpfile
rm -f $tmpfile
        


      

First, we retrieve the keys using ssh-keyscan, store them into temporary file and
        compute fingerprints afterwards using ssh-keygen. Or is there a less complex and more
        elegant solution?

      fixed](http://jaegerandi.blogspot.com/2011/11/opensuse-121-on-road-to-goldmaster-and.html)

Several people have reported in the past that during installation the system hangs
      "forever" (see bug bnc#722858) starting udev. The problem was that this did not appear
      reproduceable. It appeared once on my machine and when I brought the machine to Steffen to
      help debugging, I couldn't reproduce it. After some more tries, it was reproduceable but not
      everytime. Steffen initially thought it was a kernel race with module loading and thus we
      added "maxcpus=1" to the kernel command line. This made the bug less likely but it still
      happened. But now Christian, Coolo and myself had each a machine for reproduction and figured
      out that udevadm was waiting for some events and timing out after 10 minutes as that was the
      timeout in the installation system. So, one idea was to use the normal 30s as timeout so that
      fewer people noticed. In the end Coolo found the culprit: A bug in udev that got fixed in
      upstream udev a month ago that we got with a udev update a couple of months ago. Coolo fixed
      this with a new udev package that has been updated for 12.1 now. So, these hangs might have
      not only happened during installation but also at normal booting and I'm glad that Coolo
      decided to hunt down this bug. (...)

      new Plasma Desktop. Overall, the difference between Tumbleweed and 12.1 are minimal. As
      expected, considering [Tumbleweed](http://opensuse.org/Tumbleweed)
      (openSUSE's cool rolling release repository) was a hair away from 12.1, the biggest
      differences are probably artwork and of course Plasma 4.7 instead of 4.6...

As reported on Thursday, [GNOME Shell / Mutter no longer requires OpenGL-accelerated hardware drivers](http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTAxMTI). It's possible to run this GNOME3 desktop with a software back-end via Gallium3D's [LLVMpipe](http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=search&q=LLVMpipe).

Reaching this milestone can be attributed to Red Hat, Google's Chrome/Chromium OS developers, and others working on the Mesa / Gallium3D software stack. Just recently [LLVMpipe gained support for GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap](http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTAwNTg), the GLX extension that's required by many Linux compositing window managers.

Years ago I hung out with a friend who had a prosthetic hand. It was a stiff plastic hand, like a store mannequin hand, that could open and close in a simple grip.

It would be hard to overstate the contribution of [Richard Stallman](http://www.stallman.org/) to the digital world. The founding of the [GNU project](http://www.gnu.org/) and the creation of the [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) laid the foundations for a wide range of free software that permeates computing from smartphones to supercomputers. Free software has also directly inspired like-minded movements based around sharing, such as open access and open content (Wikipedia, notably).

At the heart of everything Stallman does lies a desire to promote freedom, specifically the freedom of the software user, by constraining the freedom of the developer in the way the code is distributed. That's in contrast to [BSD-style licenses](http://www.linfo.org/bsdlicense.html), say, where the developer is free to place additional restrictions on the code, thus reducing the freedom of the user.

"When we look to hire Linux system administrators, there are a few key aspects that get our attention," says Peter Baer Galvin, Chief Technologist for Corporate Technologies. "Natural curiosity is one. Is the candidate interested in technology, finding solutions to problems, inventing new solutions, and experimenting? We find those attributes to be a good indicator of whether the admin will be able to improvise, learn, and determine the best course of action."

Obviously, no Linux admin can have all the skills every employer will want. But as Galvin says, natural curiosity can help make you stand out as a job candidate. (...)
