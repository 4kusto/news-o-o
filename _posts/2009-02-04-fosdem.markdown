Preparing stuff for [FOSDEM](//fosdem.org), call me Sir Printalot. So we have nametags (if you didn't added you to the [list](//en.opensuse.org/FOSDEM2009) you have to live with a handwritten one), schedules and posters. I also preparing the demo systems, collecting merchandise and writing blogs about it :-) See you on Friday in Bruxelles ...

(psst, there is an obvious error in one of the printouts, if you find it (and it's the one i mean), post a comment, the first one will get a free T-Shirt at FOSDEM. Post only if you are going to Brussels and you are not working for Novell/SUSE :-) ) [https://schreib-essay.com](https://schreib-essay.com/)
