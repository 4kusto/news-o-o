Hello Geekos,

You may be aware the Linux Foundation recently launched two
Certification programs

- Linux Foundation Certified Sysadmin (LFCS) covering basic system
administration
- Linux Foundation Certified Engineers (LFCE) covering advanced
system administration and engineering skills

Full details on the programs is at [http://bit.ly/1yKRjxp](http://bit.ly/1yKRjxp)

Unlike other Linux Certification programs the exams for these are
offered on several community distributions, Ubuntu, CentOS, and our
very own openSUSE 13.1!

The Linux Foundation would like to offer openSUSE users a special $100
discount off the price of LFCS or LFCE examinations (33% off the usual
$300 price)

To get your discount, all you need to do is visit this URL
[http://bit.ly/1yKRjxp](http://bit.ly/1yKRjxp) and register for an Exam using the Coupon code:
LFopenSUSE100

This Coupon code expires on 7th November and is limited to the first
500 registrations, so I'd recommend registering quickly if you're
interested.

After registering for the exam, you have 12 months schedule and
actually take the exam, so your can register your discount and worry
about taking the exam after you've had some time to study.

Have a lot of fun!
