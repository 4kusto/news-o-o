The openSUSE release is not only available for free download but also as separate [boxed product](http://en.opensuse.org/Buy_openSUSE) to buy from retail shops and internet shops. The box product contains two DVDs for 32-bit x86 and 64-bit x86-64 systems which have the complete ftp tree of the openSUSE 10.3 distribution.  Additionally, it comes with a printed start up manual and free installation support.

As with every openSUSE release -- and also previously with SUSE Linux releases -- we have sent out during the last week to upstream package maintainers, the openSUSE translation teams and to active bug reporters an openSUSE 10.3 box for free to say thank you!
