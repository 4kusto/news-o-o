![Hack Week Logo](http://en.opensuse.org/images/thumb/3/32/Hackweek-mug.png/270px-Hackweek-mug.png)**Hackweek VI** will take place _January 24th - 28th, 2011_.

Hackweek is one of Novell's biggest ways of giving back to the openSUSE community - by providing developers the opportunity to spend their paid work week contributing to free and open source software instead of their assigned projects. Â Hackweek V produced an amazing variety of projects, including [froxlor](http://www.froxlor.org/) (server management panel), a [donor management app](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYER9WaPXg0) for [Shelterbox](http://www.shelterbox.org/), a [GUI client](http://blog.cornelius-schumacher.de/2010/06/hackweek-v-graphical-suse-studio-client.html) for [SUSE Studio](http://susestudio.com), and [hundreds ](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Hackweek_V)[more](http://www.youtube.com/user/opensusetv#p/c/ACE6F324915B8230). Prior Hackweeks have spawned projects that are now desktop Linux mainstays, like [Tasque](http://live.gnome.org/Tasque) and [Giver](http://code.google.com/p/giver/).

**Hackweek VI** features the theme "Engineering Cloud" and allows developers to get their hands on related projects. In order to support that approach, we are providing access to a few select cloud providers and a setup where you can deploy cloud infrastructure software (e.g. Eucalyptus). Your favorite hack-project may or may not relate to that theme, it may well be experimental, as long as it is Linux- or SUSE-related.

As in previous years, we will be using [openFATE](https://features.opensuse.org) to track your ideas and coordinate with others that might want to join a project. Make sure to check out all ideas listed in the [**Hack Week VI**](https://features.opensuse.org/query/run?search_products[]=hackweek_6&type=find) product category.

We also plan to nominate the 3 best projects that relate to the "Engineering Cloud" theme and hand out Amazon gift vouchers. For your project to be considered we ask you to:


<blockquote>

> 
> 
	
>   1. submit your idea until Friday Jan 21st at openFATE (opens Jan, 13)
> 
	
>   2. provide a introductory video of your project on Monday, Jan, 24th
> 
	
>   3. wrap up and do a final video submission no later than Friday, Feb 4th
> 

</blockquote>


As usual, Novell extends the invitation to openSUSE Community contributors. Â Participating Novell locations also try to provide a "hackspace", some comfy place to meet, work together and snack.

Finally, we are trying to spread the word via [#hackweek6 on twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23hackweek6) and look forward to hear about your updates there. Â For more information, follow up on the [Hackweek Portal](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Hackweek) atÂ [http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Hackweek](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Hackweek), and have fun!
