Dear openSUSE Community,

As you might be aware, SUSE's parent entity, the Attachmate Group has entered into an agreement to merge intoÂ Micro Focus, a UK-based enterprise software company. As the primary sponsor of the openSUSE Project, SUSE's President and General Manager, Nils Brauckmann has contacted the openSUSE Board to share the following key points



	
  * 


<blockquote>**Business as Usual**: There are no changes planned for the SUSE business structure and leadership. There is no need for any action by the openSUSE Project as a result of this announcement.</blockquote>




	
  * 


<blockquote>**Commitment to Open Source**: SUSE remains passionately committed to innovation through Open Source. This has always been the foundation of our business and that will continue as we grow and innovate in new areas.</blockquote>




	
  * 


<blockquote>**Commitment to openSUSE**: SUSE is also fully committed to being a sponsor and supporter of an open, highly independent and dynamic openSUSE community and project. We are proud of openSUSE and greatly value the collaborative relationship between SUSE and the openSUSE community.</blockquote>







<blockquote>The combination of the Attachmate Group and Micro Focus creates a larger, global enterprise software entity, operating at a greater global scale. This provides an even stronger foundation for the continued investment in SUSE and our continued innovation through Open Source.</blockquote>


The openSUSE Board would like to thank Nils and SUSE for this reassuring statement. The Board is enthusiastic about the benefits the merger may bring to SUSE and ultimately also to our openSUSE Project.

If anyone has any questions, there will be an opportunity to raise them at todays (Wednesday 17th Sept) regular openSUSE Project Meeting at 15:00 UTC in #opensuse-project on the Freenode IRC network.

Regards,

The openSUSE Board
