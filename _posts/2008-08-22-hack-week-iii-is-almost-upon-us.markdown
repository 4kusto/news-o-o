Hack Week III is almost upon us! Novell is once again sponsoring Hack Week, from August 25th through August 29th, and we want the openSUSE community to be in on it!

What’s Hack Week? Hack Week is a chance for Novell’s developers to work on Innovation Time Off (ITO) projects, uninterrupted by normal hacking duties. This helps provide an opportunity for Novell’s developers to work on innovative new projects they might not normally be able to work on. Since most of the projects developed during Hack Week are open source, this also benefits the community by providing new code.

During Hack Week, developers can work on any project of interest. So far Hack Week has spawned a number of impressive projects and improvements, such as Debian package support in the openSUSE Build Service, Tasque, Giver, and many others.

For HW3, we’re encouraging members of the openSUSE community to get involved as well, either by working on their own Hack Week projects, or by collaborating with Novell developers to create or enhance open source projects. To post your ideas or see what others are working on, visit [ideas.opensuse.org](//ideas.opensuse.org/). We'll have awards for several Hack Week projects, including best overall project, and the coveted First Penguin Award.

As part of the effort to expand Hack Week outside of Novell, we're bringing several community members to Novell offices to work with Novell developers on HW3 projects, and we'll be hosting a Hack Week room at the [Utah Open Source Conference](//2008.utosc.com/pages/home/) next week, August 28 through August 30. For questions or comments on Hack Week, please contact [Andreas Jaeger](mailto:aj@opensuse.org).
