The highlights of this week's status mails, for your convenience as a news article! 




	
  * We are working on a new LiveCD with updated packages (beta version [here](ftp://beta.suse.com/private/10.3-livecd)). 

	
  * Unfortunately the online update last weekend caused some problems, so we are thinking about how to avoid this next time. More information on this soon.

	
  * [FOSDEM](http://www.fosdem.org/2008/) 2008 planing started, join the discussion later this week on the opensuse-project mailinglist. Great news from the [OBS](http://opensuse.org/Build_Service) team: [Klaas](http://en.opensuse.org/User:Kfreitag) wrote a 6 page article for the German Linux Magazine about the Build Service!



More information is available in the specific mailing list posts; if you are not subscribed to the mailinglists you can also read them in the [archive](http://lists.opensuse.org/). Here are the direct links to the mails:
