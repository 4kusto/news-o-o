#### **Logo**


The logo for this year’s openSUSE Conference was selected by the Organizing Team to encourage a more consistent logo use regarding openSUSE events so they can be more easily identifiable. The logo is modified from the original, which comes from Kukuh Syafaat after being selected as[ the logo for the openSUSE.Asia Summit](https://news.opensuse.org/2015/10/02/we-have-a-logo-for-opensuse-asia-summit-2015/).


#### **Z-Bau**


The Z building is a historical relic. Hackers will occupy the cultural center that was previously known as [Merrell Barracks](http://www.nbg-mil-com.de/Merrell/me.html). Prior to World War II, it was a former [SS barracks](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS-Kaserne_%28N%C3%BCrnberg%29) that was captured and occupied by the U.S. Army's [45th Infantry Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/45th_Infantry_Division_%28United_States%29). It was used by the U.S. Army from April 18, 1945, to July 1, 1991.


#### **The openSUSE Conference**


The openSUSE Conference is the annual community event that brings people from around the world together to meet and collaborate on Free Open Source Software (FOSS) development.

#### **About Nuremberg**


[Nuremberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg) is a German town located in [Bavaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavaria). It is the second most populated city in Bavaria behind [Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich). Nuremberg is located 170km north of Munich and 224km southeast of Frankfurt. Nuremberg is distinguished by its medieval architecture, including the fortifications and stone towers of its [Altstadt (Old Town)](http://wikitravel.org/en/Nuremberg). At the northern edge of the Altstadt, surrounded by red-roofed buildings, stands [Kaiserburg Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Castle), which is used in this year's logo. The [Hauptmarkt](http://tourismus.nuernberg.de/en/sightseeing/places-of-interest/further-places-of-interest/d/nuernberger-hauptmarkt.html) (central square) contains the [Schöner Brunnen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6ner_Brunnen), the gilded “beautiful fountain” with tiers of figures, and [Frauenkirche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frauenkirche,_Nuremberg), a 14th-century Gothic church. Because of the city's relevance to the [Holy Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire) and its position in the center of Germany, the [Nazi Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Party) chose the city to be the site of huge Nazi Party conventions – the [Nuremberg rallies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Rally).
