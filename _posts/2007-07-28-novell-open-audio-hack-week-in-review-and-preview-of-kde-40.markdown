[Novell Open Audio](//www.novell.com/feeds/openaudio/) in its [current episode](//www.novell.com/feeds/openaudio/?p=170) features a retrospection of [Hack Week](//idea.opensuse.org/content/) including development site visit reports, awarded and other selected projects including this site. :-) In the second part, [Will Stephenson](//en.opensuse.org/User:Wstephenson) of the [KDE Team](//en.opensuse.org/KDE_Team) gets interviewed about the changes and architecture of the upcoming KDE 4.0. Seitdem schaue ich, was es so alles an podcasts [hausarbeithilfe.com/doktorarbeit-schreiben-lassen/](https://hausarbeithilfe.com/doktorarbeit-schreiben-lassen/) gibt
