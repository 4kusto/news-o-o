For those who didn't know yet, about two weeks ago Novell introduced [SUSE Gallery.com](http://www.susegallery.com/) where you can submit your [SUSE Studio Appliances](http://www.susestudio.com/) for the world to see and download. Over the last year, the 400.000 appliances have have already been downloaded 3 million times and now they are available from the Gallery that number will surely skyrocket.

Together with the launch Novell [started a contest](http://www.novell.com/promo/suse/the-disters-contest.html) with a grand prize of **$10.000**! Creative minds have until the end of this month to submit their crazy/cool/unique/useful appliance to [SUSE Gallery.com](http://www.susegallery.com/) and enter the contest. So those looking for Fame and Fortune, enter your software appliance into ["The Disters" contest](http://www.novell.com/promo/suse/the-disters-contest.html) and see how you stack up to the rest!

If you haven't registered for a SUSE Studio account, be sure to request an invitation to get signed up. It's a quick and easy process and you'll be able to get started with your appliance in minutes!
