Contributors of openSUSE that are not currently members can now [apply for membership](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Membership_officials#Process) during a three-week window and can be a part of the changes to come in the project.

Three seats are open for this yearâ€™s [openSUSE board elections](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election) and only members will elect representatives to serve on the openSUSE Board for a 24 months term.

openSUSE board members influence the future direction of the project, so if any openSUSE member knows a member they would like to serve on the board, they should contact the election officials to propose the candidate.

The three seats that currently held by Andrew Wafaa, Bruno Friedman and Robert Schweikert are available.

Richard Brown, the openSUSE Board chairman, the current board and the openSUSE Election Committee extended all current board member terms by one month due to scheduling, but the process for electing openSUSE representatives to serve on the board has officially begun.


#### Election Committee


The committee for this election is Andrew Wafaa and Martin Pluskal.

Only openSUSE members have the right to run for a board seat, except if they are on the Election Committee. To stand for a position on the openSUSE board, please send a mail to[ opensuse-project@opensuse.org](https://imap.suse.de/horde/imp/message.php?mailbox=INBOX&index=1383#) and [election-officials@opensuse.org](mailto:election-officials@opensuse.org).
