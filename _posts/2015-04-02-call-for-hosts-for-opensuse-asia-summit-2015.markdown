({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Logo.png) Submit proposals for the openSUSE Asia Summit 2015

The openSUSE.Asia organization committee is inviting proposals to host the openSUSE.Asia Summit during the later half of 2015. The openSUSE.Asia Summit is the featured annual openSUSE conference in Asia.

The event focuses primarily on the openSUSE distribution, and also covers desktop environments, applications and the development platform tools. It brings together the openSUSE community in Asia to provide a forum for users, developers, foundation leaders, governments and businesses to discuss both the present technology and future developments.


### Last Summit


The first openSUSE.Asia Summit was held in Beijing in 2014. The Summit's preference is to find new locations each year as we spread openSUSE throughout Asia, and we are looking for local organizers to rise to the challenge of organizing an excellent openSUSE event. The openSUSE.Asia organization committee will assist in the process, but there is a definitive need for individuals to be actively involved and committed to the planning and delivery of the event.

You can learn more about openSUSE.Asia Summit at our official website: [https://events.opensuse.org/conference/summitasia14](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/summitasia14)

<!-- more -->For those of you who are interested in hosting the next openSUSE.Asia Summit in 2015, you are invited to submit a formal proposal to the openSUSE.Asia organization committee.

We might invite you to present your proposal in more details over our regular IRC meetings, or send you additional questions and requests. Results will be announced by the last week of May, 2015.

The conference will require availability of facilities for around one week, including a weekend, during the later half of 2015.
