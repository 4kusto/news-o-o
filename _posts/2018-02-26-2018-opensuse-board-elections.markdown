[![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/drawing1-212x300.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/drawing1.png)[Elections](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election) to fill three seats on the [openSUSE Board](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board) are set to begin in the coming weeks and candidates are needed to fill these three positions.

Individuals who apply for an [openSUSE Membership](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Members) will be able to vote during elections and run for candidacy

Candidates elected to the position will serve a 24-month term. The terms of Gertjan Lettink, Bryan Lunduke and Tomas Chvatal will expire and this is a great opportunity for any member who is interested in helping the project from a seat like this to run and be elected

Members of the openSUSE board help to influence the future direction of the project. Members are encouraged to learn the [election process](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Membership_officials#Process), run for the board or propose a candidate.
