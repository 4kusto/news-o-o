![Tumbleweed-black-green]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Tumbleweed-black-green-300x127.png)Since the release of [Linux Kernel 4.7](https://www.kernel.org/) in the [20160730 snapshot](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-08/msg00053.html), which brought lengthy email discussions about out-of-tree and third-party drivers on the [Factory mailing list](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/), [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) produced three snapshots.

[Snapshot 20160803](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-08/msg00101.html) made a small update to the repositories for [Mozilla Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/) and [k3b](http://www.k3b.org/). The snapshot updated libzypp to version 16.2.1, gnome-online-accounts to 3.20.3 and obs-service-source_validator. In [20160803](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-08/msg00101.html), virt-viewer had the most changes.

[Snapshot 20160805](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-08/msg00116.html) brought more package changes and one major uninstall. [LXDM](http://wiki.lxde.org/en/LXDM) was dropped from openSUSE Tumbleweed and uninstalled in this snapshot. [LightDM](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/LightDM/) is being used in the environment instead and is auto-installed with a change configuration for those who are using LXDM. This snapshot provided several repository updates, and NetworkManager-gnome, [Libreoffice 5.2.0.4](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/?version=5.2.0) and [WireShark 2.0.5](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/relnotes/wireshark-2.0.5.html) were a few of the many changes found is [20160805](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-08/msg00116.html).

The most recent snapshot, [20160806](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-08/msg00164.html), updated [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/), which provides more extensions. [Wayland-protocols](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols) updated to a new upstream release of 1.5 and [btrfsprogs](https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Changelog) has new options to run in the background with version 4.7.

Tumbleweed users will likely get Plasma 5.72 in the next snapshot, which should be released soon.


### openSUSE Leap


In two weeks is the submission deadline to get packages in the next version of openSUSE Leap 42.2. The Beta 1 is scheduled for release at the end of this month, according to the [roadmap](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Roadmap).

The current development version, [Alpha 3](https://software.opensuse.org/developer/en?release=developer), needs more people to test the version and file bugs. Download Alpha 3 and test it out at [software.opensuse.org](https://software.opensuse.org/developer/en?release=developer).
