﻿﻿﻿The Ohio Linux Fest will be on September 10-12, 2010 in Columbus, Ohio.  There is now a one-week extension for Call for Partiicipation.

If any of you are in the Ohio area and would like to give a talk about openSUSE, we encourage you to register your talk proposal [here.](http://http://www.ohiolinux.org/node/674)

From the website:


<blockquote>We're looking for speakers who can address a wide range of topics related to Linux and open source. Talks suited for beginners or experts, or in-between, are welcome. We're particularly interested in talks on current topics like Android, MeeGo, KVM, Python for System Administration, WordPress, GNOME, KDE, Ruby on Rails, Django, Linux distributions, and more.e:</blockquote>


So let's get openSUSE noticed there and spread the word about our newest release, openSUSE 11.3!  And if you're going, let us know.  I know of a couple of people, including myself that will try to make it there.  It would be great if we have our own little mini-Meet & Greet while at OLF.  Not to mention it's always great to meet and interact with other projects in our FOSS community.

Thanks,
