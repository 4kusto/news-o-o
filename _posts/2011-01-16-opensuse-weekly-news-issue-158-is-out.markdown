      [Reviewing
        the Trademark Guidelines](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/01/11/reviewing-the-trademark-guidelines/)
    **

In 2009, a set of [trademark guidelines](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Trademark_guidelines) were created to help define how the community and beyond could
      use the openSUSE logo and related trademarks in their own products and services. Along with
      this, Novell granted powers to the openSUSE Board to be the guardians of the openSUSE
      trademarks. This included ensuring that proper usage followed the guidelines as well as giving
      the Board the ability to review special use cases.

It also helped those who wanted written permission from the Board authorizing the use of
      trademarks on their products and services. Formal requests for such permissions were sent to
        `<[permission@novell.com](mailto:permission@novell.com)>`, and Novell would forward the request to the Board for
      review. 

As you know, trademark protection is important because it represents the identity of an
      organization. Trademark usage also provides an important tool for the community that wishes to
      promote openSUSE. The use of the trademarks makes it easier to share and spread openSUSE
      works. Of course, regulating the appropriate usage of the trademarks is also a necessary evil
      to prevent abuse. 

As with anything in life, time gives perspective. There has been sufficient time since the
      implementation of the first guidelines to observe real use cases where the guidelines were
      either effective or ineffective. And for the Board, this includes identifying a more
      responsive workflow to addressing requests for authorization of usage, as we, and others,
      recognize the current process as being perfectible. 

The Board, along with others in the community, would like to begin a review of the current
      state of our trademark guidelines and identify where it can be strengthened and be more
      effective. To this end, our first step is to open an [openFATE Feature request](https://features.opensuse.org/311039) for comments. We
      invite the community and beyond to review the current guidelines and offer their input on
      language and past use case experiences. 

While we would like comments submitted on openFATE, if you prefer, you can post your
      comments here or send your thoughts directly to `<[board@opensuse.org](mailto:board@opensuse.org)>`. A specific
      timeline for completion of this process has not been determined yet, but it is the intention
      of the Board to move forward on this topic in order to help the community at large move
      forward on their own projects.

**[The
        openSUSE Board election 2010](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/01/12/the-opensuse-board-election-2010/)**

The openSUSE Board Election process, started in December 2010, is heading full-speed for
      the planned announcement of the results on January 26, 2011. Today the voting begins and itâ€™s
      time to take a closer look at the candidates and [make up our minds](https://connect.opensuse.org/pg/polls/read/digitaltomm/10769/opensuse-board-election-2011)!

<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="25%" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" ><tr >
<td align="center" >![](/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/vote.jpeg)
</td></tr></table>

In this election we will have 2 seats to be voted upon as the board periods of Pascal
      Bleser and Henne Vogelsang expire. With the existing company affiliations in the board (Pavol
      Prusnak- Novell, Bryen Yunashko â€“ none, Rupert HorstkÃ¶tter â€“ openSLX) the restraint is that at
      most one of the to be elected members can be affiliated with Novell and at most one with
      openSLX. According to the [election
        rules](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election#Company_affiliation), no single organization or company can control more than 40 percent of the
      electable Board seats. That means, in this election, that if two candidates from either Novell
      or openSLX score a first and second place, only the one with most votes will have a seat. The
      other seat will to go to the third candidate in line (provided of course that person is not
      also affiliated with the same company). This time we have seven candidates, all contributors
      with different experiences and backgrounds.

The openSUSE board was set up to lead the overall project. The main tasks for members of
      the board are:

  * Act as a central point of contact

  * Help resolve conflicts

  * Communicate community interests to Novell

  * Facilitate communication with all areas of the community

  * Facilitate decision making processes where needed

The board should provide guidance to and support for existing governance structures, but
      shouldnâ€™t direct or control development, since community mechanisms exist to accomplish the
      goals of the project. The board does however document decisions and policies, as well as
      mediate when issues arise. The board decides on usage of the trademarks of openSUSE, deals
      with conflicts, works with the Novell openSUSE community manager on funding decisions, works
      with the community on the organization of events and in general does a lot of â€˜small thingsâ€™
      often only visible when they are not handled. The board members are elected according to
        [Board Election rules](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election) by
      the members of the community whoâ€™ve been accepted as official â€˜openSUSE Membersâ€™ and the chair
      person is appointed by Novell. Current chair is Alan Clark. 

Our current Board has had a busy time in the last year, setting up the foundations for a
      great 2011 for openSUSE. And the new Board members will need to put in some hard work to bring
      openSUSE to this new level. This includes the work on setting up the Foundation and the new
      responsibilities waiting for the board once that work has completed. Moreover challenges that
      might come up related to the Attachmate takeover of Novell have to be handled but also the
      usual day to day work in the community must continue. 

Ballots have just been opened and all openSUSE members whose membership is in good
      standing are eligible to vote. Please verify if your email address is valid and that you are
      able to read emails sent to your openSUSE address! The ballots are being done via the web on
        [connect.opensuse.org](https://connect.opensuse.org/pg/polls/read/digitaltomm/10769/opensuse-board-election-2011) and have been announced on [opensuse-project IRC
        channel and Mailing Lists](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2011-01/msg00048.html). Once a vote has been submitted it may not be changed
      afterwards. Finally, voting will end on [January 26th,
        2011](http://bit.ly/gkQypN) when the ballots close. Shortly thereafter, you can expect the announcement of
      our two new board members!

          [Nelson
            Marques: Wallpaper Community Pack #1](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/01/13/wallpaper-community-pack-1/)
        **

Iâ€™ve received some emails and some positive feedback about one wallpaper I used for a
          couple of screenshotâ€™s Iâ€™ve used in the past, including also information requests about
          where that very same wallpaper could be found. Iâ€™m happy people liked my choice. 

The wallpaper is question is the following, which can be found at [gnome-look [dot] org](http://gnome-look.org): Green Snake HD - by Kmurat @
          gnome-art.org

<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="25%" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" ><tr >

</td></tr></table>

It is clear to me at this stage that Artwork has good demand and itâ€™s a â€˜value +â€™
          recognized by many users. Understanding this, Iâ€™ve decided two things: 

  1. GNOME:Ayatana will have a small Artwork Package by the Community, Iâ€™m currently
                contacting Kmurat to check if he can change the licence on this artwork piece (with
                over 20.000 downloads on gnome-art) so I can use it for distribution. Currently itâ€™s
                licensed as CC BY-NC-ND, in which the NC can be probably a problem. Letâ€™s wait a
                couple of days and seeâ€¦ Either way for those who asked for the source of this
                wallpaper, click on the image above.

  2. I will create a small package with wallpapers from the community and make it
                available (for GNOME, KDE, etc) users.

My intentions are to include a set of wallpapers (4/3, 16/9 and 16/10) of
          around 5/7 wallpapers from several artists and community contributors. The first person
          Iâ€™ve contacted regarding this was Javier Llorente, a openSUSE Artwork Team and KDE
          contributor, which donated and pointed some artwork. Iâ€™ve also sent a small email to
            [MarÃ­a â€˜Taticaâ€™ Leandro](http://tatica.org), a contributor of Fedora
          Design Team from South America asking if she had something that she could share with us
          for this community package (I did loved some of her submissions into Fedora Art).
          Additionally, Iâ€™m also going to nag [Sirko Kemter
            (gnokii)](http://karl-tux-stadt.de) for a contributionâ€¦ 

Once this is assembled (already have 5 wallpapers) Iâ€™m going to package it, run a
          sanity check and prepare it for distributionâ€¦ 

**UPDATE**: MarÃ­a â€˜Taticaâ€™ Leandro has answered positive
          to my email requesting for a donation, Sirko Kemter also answered positive.

            really makes me think we should go this way.

Ray's comment starting with "Every flicker and mode change in the boot
            process takes away from the whole experience." is especially interesting. Is it
            okay to track the "don't show grub by default" here?"

##### Recently requested features

**Features newly requested last week. Please vote and/or comment
            if you get interested.**

**
            [Ensure opensuse displays properly on a
              1024x576 netbook screen](https://features.opensuse.org/311048)
          **

I currently run opensuse 11.2 on a lenovo S10e netbook with a kde desktop.

As it not uncommon in the netbook world the screen resolution is 1024x576 (16:9)
            rather the the 1024x600 (16:10) which may be more familiar.

The problem is that menus for critical functionality such as NetworkManager are too
            tall for the display even if resized, so it is physically impossible to
            "apply" settings as this button is always at the bottom of the dialogue
            box.

Can effort be made to ensure that opensuse 11.4 does not have menus for critical
            system components such as NetworkManager which will not display at typical netbook
            screen resolutions?

**

            [Kernel: Update README.SUSE](https://features.opensuse.org/311057)
          **

README.SUSE lacks documentation for stuff like patches.addon and mkspec as also
            hinted at

http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-kernel/2010-07/msg00014.html

**
            [Better support for Garmin GPS](https://features.opensuse.org/311058)
          **

Garmin peripherals seem not to be automatically recognised under openSuse.

At least for my e-trex, I need to do some manual configuration in order for it to be
            recognised. For this I follow the procedure indicated on the GPSbabel website.

Can the situation be improved at the distribution level?

**
            [Installer like Fedora](https://features.opensuse.org/311059)
          **

Maybe you know the Fedora installer. You've got four options:

- Use all Disk space

- Update the existent Linux system

- Use free disk place

- Do your own partition table

This would be a nice and easy to use feature for openSUSE too. Maybe as a additional
            installation-option, that you can choose. By the way, Fedora-users have it easy to
            change to openSUSE.

What do you think?

**
            [Scanner buttons configuration](https://features.opensuse.org/311061)
          **

Please, add the ability to configure the scanner buttons via Yast. Configure=assign
            an action, like one-button scan. Currently, this can be done with scanbuttond daemon,
            but its configuration is far from straightforward, let alone convenient.

            [A radio button "stay login
              in"](https://features.opensuse.org/311065)
          **

A radio button "stay login in" in authorization form (like this
            http://img.flashtux.org/img132db222350dx1203e659.png ) in openSUSE sites.

              Fingerprint](https://features.opensuse.org/311067)
          **

Some Lenovo laptops use the UPEK driver for fingerprint. Using the latest version of
            fingerprint-gui (which also ships the UPEK drivers) gives me a perfect functionality of
            my device. However, Yast does still not recognize my device. Could it be easily
            implemented?

Maybe provide packages for fingerprint-gui, too, and Fedora's
            system-config-authentication:

**[openSUSE 11.1 has reached end of Novell support - 11.1 Evergreen goes on](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2011-01/msg00005.html)**

With the release of an opensc security fix on Thursday 13th
        January Novell has released the last update for openSUSE 11.1.

openSUSE 11.1 is now officially discontinued and out of support
        by Novell.

However, a community effort has been started to continue 11.1 maintenance under the
      codename of "Evergreen".

The overview page of this project, how to activate and use it, and other details, is on:
        [http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen)

The Evergreen project is lead by openSUSE community member **Wolfgang
        Rosenauer**.

Here are some statistics:

openSUSE 11.1 was released on December 18th 2008, making it 2 years and 1 month of
      security and bugfix support.

Some statistics on the released patches (compared to 11.0) can shown [there](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2011-01/msg00005.html).

    **

**For Linux 2.6.38, the kernel developers have integrated the
        much-discussed patch which considerably improves the response time of Linux desktops in
        certain situations. The AMD developers have extended their open source graphics drivers to
        support various Radeon HD 6000 graphics chips. A discussion was sparked by the tricky
        situation surrounding the graphics drivers for Intel's new processors. **

After the [release
        of Linux 2.6.37](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/What-s-new-in-Linux-2-6-37-1163376.html) on Wednesday morning, the first patches for kernel version 2.6.38
      appeared in the Linux main development branch late on Thursday night. Among Torvalds' first
      2,769 commits were the almost 600 patches for the network subsystem that had been [submitted](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.network/183011) by its
      maintainer, David Miller. As expected, these patches have added the [rtl8192ce
        driver](http://git.kernel.org/linus/0c8173385e549f95cd80c3fff5aab87b4f881d8d) for Realtek's RTL8192CE and RTL8188CE 802.11n Wi-Fi chips to the kernel. 

The first changes made for Linux 2.6.38 also include [the patch](http://git.kernel.org/linus/5091faa449ee0b7d73bc296a93bca9540fc51d0a)
      that considerably improves the interactivity of desktop applications in situations where the
      CPU is fully utilised. This patch became known through such articles as [â€œThe ~200 Line Linux Kernel Patch That Does
        Wondersâ€](http://bit.ly/fI6LyR) on the Phoronix web site; details of the patch's functionality as

The maintainer of the process scheduler, Ingo Molnar, [explicitly pointed out](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1084129) this

Thereâ€™s a reason theyâ€™re called â€œmovies.â€ Theyâ€™re supposed to move. Your eyes are keyed
        to follow motion, and the constant revelation of new information in a moving shot holds your
        interest longer. Thus, while four seconds might be about the maximum comfortable length for
        a static shot, shots in which the camera or subject are moving extensively can often last
        more than a minute without feeling slow at all. Storyboards made entirely from static images
        make it hard to judge active shots. Itâ€™s useful, therefore, to be able to insert some
        movement at the storyboard phase by panning and zooming a drawing. Here Iâ€™m going to
        demonstrate such an animated storyboard using Inkscape and Blender. (...)

          P: Download all youtube videos of a user](http://psankar.blogspot.com/2011/01/download-all-youtube-videos-of-user.html)**

Recently I got addicted to watching Nigella Lawson Cooking videos on youtube. As much as
        I like youtube, I prefer to watch videos offline as well. One user has uploaded a lot of
        those videos and I wanted to download all the videos by that user. 

I tried a few firefox plugins, youtube-dl python script, etc. for doing this but none
        seemed to be fit for the job. Good old Shell-script came for rescue. I saved the user's
        youtube homepage in .html, grepped through the file for links, ran uniq and then fed them
        all to youtube-dl and bulk-downloaded all the videos. If you want parallel downloads, you
        can easily do that also by tweaking the script.

The commands
        are:
    
    grep -E 'http://www.youtube.com/watch\?v=[[:alnum:]-]{11}' dump.html -o | uniq > vdos
    for i in `cat vdos`; do youtube-dl -t $i; done; rm vdos;

HTH someone. 

If you know of a better solution (some firefox/chrome addon, Greasmonkey, etc.) which
        will work in Linux, please let me know.

The Linux kernel allows drivers and features to be compiled as modules rather than as
        part of the kernel itself. This means that users can often change features in the kernel or
        add drivers without recompiling, and that the Linux kernel doesn't have to carry a lot
        of unnecessary baggage. Want to learn how to manage your modules? It's easy to do, just
        keep reading.

        [Chuck Payne: System Administrator 101 â€” A
          Basic Bash Loop â€” Part 1 â€œforâ€](http://opensuse.terrorpup.net/?p=196)
      **

Being a System Administrator you will find that you need to do a lot of repetitive
        tasks. Moving files, grepping files, and creating users. You could spend all your time type
        the same commands over and over, but why? 

You can save a lot of time by looping commands. There are three ways you can do that, by
        using one of the following; for, while or until. We will first focus on for, it my favorite
        of the three. 

The thing to remember with a â€˜for loopâ€™ is the following
        syntax:
    
    for variable in x y z ; do command $variable ; done

Variable is what ever you want to call it. Most people use i as a variable, but again it
        can be anything you want. The x y x is the information that you want to pass to the command.
        The last thing to remember with a loop is when it passed everything to the command that if
        finish, that is why you need the done. 

Here is an example of a simple count down that you can do with for a â€˜for
        loopâ€™.
    
    for i in 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 ; do echo $i ; done

As you can see, we have set our variable to be i, in that variable we are going to pass
        10 to 1 to the command echo. By the way, you can do this another way if you are using Bash
        4.0, by changing the number to {10â€¦1} , this because of inbuilt support for setting up a
        step value use {START..END..INCREMENT} . 

Here is another example, we are going fun and make the computer count out load to 100 by
        5â€²sâ€¦
    
    for x in {5..100..5} ; do echo  | festival --tts ; done

In this loop we set our variable to x, and we told it to start with 5 go to 100 by
        increments of 5. We then passed that on to echo that is piped into festival to read it out
        load, once it had reach 100, it stops. 

Here are some real world examples of how System Administrator use a â€˜for loopâ€™. Let say
        you have a text file that you keep a list of Linux servers that you take care and you need
        to push a rpm or a file to
        them.
    
     linux01 192.168.1.1
     linux05 192.168.1.5
     linux10 192.168.1.10
     linux20 192.168.1.20

With a â€˜for loopâ€™ it is very simple and fast. We are going to cat the file so that we
        know what server to access. We are also going to use awk so that we get the ip from the
        second coloumn. To get the information we will need to pipe â€˜ | â€œ the loop into the awk
        command to get it, because we are run commands to get the information for the loop we will
        need to use ` ` in order to run the
        statement.
    
    for f in `cat linux_server | awk '{ print $2}'` ; do scp somefile user@$f:/dir ; done

This loop tell that our variable f is going to pass the four ip so that we can scp the
        file to those boxes.

### Note

If you are not sure about what the output going to look like, it always best to use
            the following to see what the output going to beâ€¦.
    
    echo $f

Now lets say that file you pushed to the server is rpm that you need to update your
        server. You can do â€˜for loopâ€™, using ssh and pass the command to the boxes to update that
        rpm
    
    for r in `cat linux_server | awk '{ print $2 }` ; do ssh user@$r rpm -Uvh /dir/myfile ; 
    
    done

To ensure that the file was updated, you can do another â€˜for loopâ€™ check the rpm
        database to see if there by doing rpm -qa and pipe into a grep with the file
        name.
    
    for r in `cat linux_server | awk '{ print $2 }` ; do ssh user@$r rpm -qa | grep myfile ; 
    
    done

By the way you can use all of these commands together in one script to save even more
        time.
    
    #!/bin/bash
     servers=â€linux_serverâ€
     files=â€files_to_pushâ€
     
    # Here we are going push files 
    for f in `cat $servers | awk '{ print $2}'` ; do scp $files user@$f:/dir ; done
    # Here we are going to install the files 
    for r in `cat $servers | awk '{ print $2 }` ; do ssh user@$r rpm -Uvh /dir/$files ; done
    # Here we are going to check if it got installed 
    for x in `cat $servers | awk '{ print $2 }` ; do ssh user@ rpm-qa | grep $files ; done
    exit 0

As great System Administrator, finding the simplest ways to do recurring tasks frees up
        your time for tackling more complex problems . A â€˜for loopâ€™ is a great way to help. Next
        time I will go over while. **License**: 3

      **

Iâ€™ve had some problems in the past with openSUSE Factory and ATI supportâ€¦ even the
        normal radeon driver wasnâ€™t worked properly. After the last updates, the radeon driver
        started working properly and Iâ€™ve decided to install the ATI FireGL driver which is actually
        something I need to continue testing and debug Unity implementation on openSUSE. 

IT WORKS! 

Hereâ€™s what you need (64 bit users):

  * Install the required dependencies to compile the kernel module (currently on
              ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿2.6.37-rc5-12-desktop). 64bit users will require the
              following:
    
    zypper in kernel-source compat-32bit qt3-32bit libstdc++ libgcc xorg-x11-libs-32bit \
    
    xorg-x11-devel-32bit Mesa-devel-32bit \
    
    fontconfig-32bit expat-32bit freetype2-32bit zlib-32bit gcc make

  * Download ATI FireGL driver (version 10.12) from ATI website (http://ati.amd.com).
            

  * Extract the files using the
              command:
    
    sh ati-driver-installer-10-12-x86.x86_64.run --extract

This will create a small folder which starts with fglrx. Change directory into
              that folderâ€¦ 

  * Download the following patches:

    * [sema_init.patch](http://aur.archlinux.org/packages/catalyst/catalyst/sema_init.patch)

    * [fglrx-2.6.36.patch](http://aur.archlinux.org/packages/catalyst/catalyst/fglrx-2.6.36.patch)

    * [makefile_compat.patch](http://aur.archlinux.org/packages/catalyst/catalyst/makefile_compat.patch)

  * Apply the patches (patch -p1 < file.patch).

  * Run the following
              command:
    
    sh ati-installer.sh 8.801 --install

  * Follow the installer instructions. Finally check /usr/share/ati/fglrx-install.log
              to check if everything is coolâ€¦

  * Restart using your favorite methodâ€¦ mine is â€˜shutdown now -frnâ€™.

Enjoy FireGL on openSUSE Factory!

In mid-October we wrote about [openSUSE 11.1 being put out to pasture](http://omgsuse.com/content/adios-opensuse-111) and the openSUSE team's decision to rapidly
      end-of-life the release. In the world of open source, what does "end of life" actually mean
      for users? As resident security expert [Marcus
        Meissner](http://twitter.com/msmeissn) stated in the original announcement: 

â€œSUSE Security announces that the SUSE Security Team will
          stop releasing updates for openSUSE 11.1 soon. Having provided security-relevant fixes for
          the last two years, we will stop releasing updates after December 31st
        2010.â€
    

Before the deadline of December 31st came, there [was already talk](http://www.rosenauer.org/blog/2010/11/30/community-powered-long-term-support-for-opensuse/) about extending support for openSUSE 11.1 by the openSUSE
      community. Shortly after the new year, openSUSE [project Evergreen
        was born](http://www.rosenauer.org/blog/2011/01/03/opensuse-project-evergreen/), a community-powered attempt at extending long-term support for 11.1. 

Currently Evergreen is still very much an experiment but community member [Wolfgang Rosenauer](http://www.rosenauer.org/blog/), who originally proposed the
      project, is actively working with a few other contributors to get all the infrastructural and

  * Update [liquidwar6](http://www.gnu.org/software/liquidwar6/), the
            particle simulation game, to 0.0.9beta in games

  * Update [maxima](http://maxima.sourceforge.net/), the Computer
            Algebra system, in science to 5.23.0

  * Update [unshield](http://www.synce.org), the .CAB file extractor
            from the SynCE project, in Archiving (and eventually
            Factory) to 0.6

  * Fix build of [denyhosts](http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/), the

      This has kept the Forums Team busy for a bit. With the new forums template effective, we've looked for further improvement of the accessibility of the forums. We hope help, info and the community have come a couple of clicks closer for our members and guests. Another aspect is the improved visibility of the non-english forums. This thread gets a lot of reponse. Don't forget to check the new home page layout.

      We use an open source OS, open source programs, now what if we actually want to take a look at the source of a program to see, like in this thread, where it takes it's icons from. The replies point to the ins and outs of this.

      When files, like photos get copied from a CD they keep their read-only permissions. This member supports his parents in using linux, he knows how to change the permissions himself, but he does not want his parents to have to do that. Yet they would need write permissions to their photos to do some basic photo editing, like rotation and removing red eyes. Read how it can be done.

        [OSTatic/Lisa Hoover: Black Duck Software Buys Olliance Consulting Group](http://ostatic.com/blog/black-duck-software-buys-olliance-consulting-group)
      **

In its continued march across the open source industry landscape, [Black Duck Software](http://www.blackducksoftware.com), a Boston-based company
        which services managed and secure implementations of open source software, announced today
        the purchase of [Olliance Group](http://www.olliancegroup.com/), an open
        source enterprise consulting firm. After [acquiring open source search engine
          Koders](http://ostatic.com/blog/black-duck-buys-koders) in 2008, Black Duck got quiet for a while then slurped up three more
        companies in the last three months -- [Oholoh](http://www.ohloh.net/),
          [SpikeSource](http://ostatic.com/blog/black-duck-extends-its-string-of-open-source-acquisitions), and now Olliance. We caught up wtih Peter Vescuso, Executive Vice
        President of Black Duck Software to find out more about this acquisition and what the future
        holds for the company.

According to Vescuso, the decision to purchase Olliance was a natural evolution in
        response to the changing needs of Black Ducks' customer base. â€œOver the last few years
          as our business has grown weâ€™ve encountered more and more customers that not only needed a
          software platform to manage their use of open source components, but wanted help with
          business strategy around their use of open source, policy development, etc. Last year we
          formalized a partnership with Olliance to address this need which has been successful
          beyond our expectations. So much so that we realized for Black Duck to achieve its vision
          of being the company that organizations trust for all their FOSS-enablement needs, we
          needed to acquire Olliance, the leading consultancy in this areaâ€, says
        Vescuso.

Although Black Duck already offers some consulting services to clients, they are mainly
        focused on pre- and post-deployment support. Olliance's consulting services, on the other
        hand, help businesses map out how open source fits into a their overall business strategy
          â€œBlack Duckâ€™s services have been mostly focused on process integration and
          implementation, roll out, with some services for policy developmentâ€, says Vescuso.
          â€œOllianceâ€™s strength and deep knowledge developed over hundreds of customer
          engagements is in business strategy, policy and process, which is highly complementary to
          what we were offering, hence the motivation to acquire Ollianceâ€. (...) **License**: 5

        [ EweekEurope/Tom Jowitt: Novell: Community Wants OpenSUSE Foundation ](http://www.eweekeurope.co.uk/interview/novell-community-wants-opensuse-foundation-17980)
      **

Open source commentators were suspicious when news emerged that [openSUSE will move to an independent foundation](http://www.eweekeurope.co.uk/news/concerns-raised-over-opensuse-spin-off-17723), during the acquisition of
        Novell, which currently supports openSUSE development. 

But the move is in line with the wishes of the openSUSE community, will be properly
        funded, and does not represent any fading of Novellâ€™s interest in the Linux version â€“ or any
        lack of involvement by [Novellâ€™s prospective owner, Attachmate](http://www.eweekeurope.co.uk/news/microsoft-gets-novell-ip-in-2-65-billion-carve-up-13995). 

That is the view of Jos Poortvliet, Jos Poortvliet, openSUSE Community Manager at
        Novell, who contacted us to give some background to the move, which he says dates back well
        before the Attachmate deal was announced. (...) **License**:
