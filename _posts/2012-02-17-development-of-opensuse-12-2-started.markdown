With the release of [Milestone 1,](http://software.opensuse.org/developer) the development of openSUSE 12.2 has started! We're pleased to announce that Milestone 1 contains many minor updates, like a new Firefox version but also major things like new artwork and KDE 4.8.

Our release manager, Stephan "Coolo" Kulow said:


<blockquote>There have been enough weeks without another release,
so I started now with uploading Milestone1 of 12.2
(build151)

The main purpose of this release is to find all the
places that need to be changed from 12.1 to 12.2 - the
branding already made a great start. Milestone1 sure
looks great - and different to 12.1 already at this
early stage. Great work, artwork team.</blockquote>


Please keep in mind that Milestone 1 is only the beginning of the 12.2 development cycle and that some things might not work as they should. Please stay patient. We would appreciate if you would test the development release and report bugs and problems to us.



Have a lot of fun...
