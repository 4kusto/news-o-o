![](http://www.storch-bleckmar.de/pictures/photo/2017.04/thumbnail/2017.04.14-16:30:55.jpeg)Creating cool projects is what makes [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) so much fun and a recent project by an openSUSE member highlights just how creative and fun one can be using openSUSE.

Adrian Schröter took a [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org) using openSUSE to create a [3D-printed foldable tripod](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1460181) and took the idea even further by using the Raspberry Pi 3 used to build the tripod to take interval photographs of a Storch and it’s nest with a Sony A5100 camera.

The nest appeared in 2016 and Schröter has been taking pictures of the Storch and it’s nest for a few months.

![](http://www.storch-bleckmar.de/blog/images/DSC_0112.JPG)To print the foldable tripod, Schröter made the design using [FreeCAD](https://software.opensuse.org/package/FreeCAD), which is a general purpose 3D Computer-Aided Design program that he packages for openSUSE’s distributions. Sony A5100 support for [Gphoto ](https://software.opensuse.org/package/gphoto)from another community member, Marcus Meissner, helped to get the camera functioning to take photos roughly every 30 seconds.

Schröter has a blog about that updates pictures about the Storch and it’s nest at [http://www.storch-bleckmar.de](http://www.storch-bleckmar.de). The blog is in German, so brush up on your Deutsch or just enjoy the photos.
