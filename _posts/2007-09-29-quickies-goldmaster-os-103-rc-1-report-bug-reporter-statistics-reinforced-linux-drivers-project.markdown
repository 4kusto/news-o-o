openSUSE 10.3 [has been declared Gold](//andreasjaeger.blogspot.com/2007/09/opensuse-103-goldmaster.html) and will now be uploaded to the mirrors and available for download on October 4th - the [boxed version can be pre-ordered](//en.opensuse.org/Buy_openSUSE) for delivery shortly after. tuxmachines.org has a late [report on openSUSE 10.3 RC 1](//www.tuxmachines.org/node/20446) with [lots of new screenshots](//www.tuxmachines.org/gallery/v/suse103r1/). Francis has created [statistics about the openSUSE 10.3 bug reporters](//lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2007-09/msg00774.html) - half of the bug reports were done by non-Novell community members. Novell is [now putting more resources](//www.kroah.com/log/linux/linux_driver_project_kickoff.html) into the [Linux Driver Project](//www.linuxdriverproject.org/twiki/bin/view) which offers to write drivers for companies, for free.
