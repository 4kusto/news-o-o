For the past few months we, the openSUSE [Board](http://en.opensuse.org/Board), together with the great help from [Kurt Garloff](http://en.opensuse.org/User:Garloff), [Jan Weber](http://en.opensuse.org/User:Japa83) and [Andreas Jaeger](http://en.opensuse.org/User:A_jaeger), held a series of strategy sessions to address the future of openSUSE. We discussed the role of openSUSE as a community and project and looked at data from a variety of sources, including the recent openSUSE 2010 [Survey](http://en.opensuse.org/UX/openSUSE_Survey_2010) to identify and build a strategy of strength and empowerment within our community, with a goal of establishing a common unified ground for answering the question to ourselves and to the world... "Why openSUSE?" and openSUSE's role in the operating system market, both today and in the future.

After much discussion, we're finally ready to bring together these important bits of information into a cohesive statement that everyone can unify around. As such, we, the members of the Strategy Team, will be meeting in Nuremberg the weekend of May 28th to formalize a draft of our strategy that will be available publicly for open discussion and comment.

The weekend strategy retreat will be preceded by a General Board Meeting Friday morning and a Meet & Greet for the general public Friday evening. If you are in the Nuremberg area or are willing to travel to Nuremberg, we invite you for a sociable evening of chat and drinks at the SUSE-Nuremberg offices at 6:00 p.m, SUSE Linux Products GmbH, Ground Floor/Erdgeschoß,
Maxfeldstraße 5, 90409 Nürnberg. Meet the Board, members of the openSUSE Boosters team and other SUSE guys there. We'll do a few short presentations but the focus lays clearly on communication and having fun.
