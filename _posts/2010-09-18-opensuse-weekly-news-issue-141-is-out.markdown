####  [Forum Users Benefit from openSUSE KDE Repository](http://news.opensuse.org/2010/09/12/forum-users-benefit-from-opensuse-kde-repository/)


"Without question, users who frequent the openSUSE forums are very appreciative of all the work being done by ALL the various development teams. The progressive nature of KDE4 continues to spark a great deal of interest generally, though especially do users want options to try the latest and greatest, yet at the same time maintain a level of stability. With KDE development moving so quickly between distribution releases, users donâ€™t want to be stuck with the distro release version of KDE. The much requested 4.5.* stable repo has now been provided for openSUSE 11.3 users. Those currently using the Factory repo will now be able to switch to:  [http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/KDE:/Release:/45/openSUSE_11.3/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/KDE:/Release:/45/openSUSE_11.3/)"  


####  [openSUSE Conference 2010 â€“ Collaborate Across Borders](http://news.opensuse.org/2010/09/13/collaborate-across-borders/)


"The openSUSE Conference brings together users, contributors and friends of the openSUSE project from 20th to 23rd October in Nuremberg, Germany. Over four days, more than seventy talks and workshops explore the theme of â€˜Collaboration Across Bordersâ€˜ in Free and Open Source software communities, administration and development. The conference is the yearly get-together of the openSUSE project to give its people a chance to meet face to face, talk to and inspire each other. It takes place in the BerufsfÃ¶rderungswerk Nuremberg in the beautiful surroundings of the Franconian metropole. Everybody interested is welcome to join and enjoy the program which starts each day at 9am, the admission is free."

####  [openSUSE: Finding The Target](http://news.opensuse.org/2010/09/16/opensuse_finding_target/)


"Hi all, Your strategy team has been working hard, as promised, to incorporate the comments you have all given over the last few months into a new document. That document aims to describe where openSUSE stands right now, what users we target, what we are doing. Who we are has been covered pretty decently in the current community statement and now we would like to present you with what users we target.  While you can all give us your input in the usual way (commenting down here, replying on the openSUSE mailinglists, on the forums and in private mail or IM), we have decided to make use of another commenting platform which is much more suited for a discussion like the one we are having. This is called co-ment, a pretty awesome commenting tool under the GNU Affero GPL. We would like to ask you to give your input on the document there instead of in the other channels so the discussion will be more structured and easier for everyone to follow. Select some text you want to comment on (a word, a few words, a sentence) and choose the little yellow + sign on the top-left to add your comment. If you click a colored section of the text, you can see the comments which have been made on it and add your own. Easy peasy!  You can find the document here. And for reference here the openSUSE Strategy portal on the wiki. Please have fun!"

"â€˜merc retroâ€™ is a small project I started on SUSE Studio and aims to deploy a minimalist install of openSUSE 11.3 with GNOME and some applications. â€˜merc retroâ€™ is intended to run from a self bootable USB stick and comes packing some handpicked applications:..."  


####  [Jos Poortvliet: directions - openSUSE and Fedora](http://nowwhatthe.blogspot.com/2010/09/directions-opensuse-and-fedora.html)


"Interestingly enough, in parallel to our discussion about where we're going, Fedora is also discussing strategy. One particularly good blog post by MÃ¡irÃ­n Duffy about target users of Fedora offers some interesting insights.  **Situation** On Fedora, there are basically four repositories:  * Stable - end user product  * Testing - stabilisation tree  * Rawhide - development tree (our factory)  * Kopers - personal repositories (bit like our Build Service home projects)  As you might know, Fedora Stable does currently receive quite some package updates over it's lifecycle - catering to users who want the latest software. The downside of this is that it sacrifices stability - you can't have your cake and eat it too. And for some users - even that isn't enough. They want the latest Banshee when it is released right away - not wait for it to mature in Testing. So they have to enable Rawhide repositories - often bringing in far more unstable software than just Banshee or whatever they're after. And that software is build against a whole different stack - Rawhide has moved beyond stable of course, adding things like a newer glib or other base libraries and building against a newer GCC. All this creates a significant risk for instability."

####  [Andreas Jaeger: Build Service Cheat Sheet](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/09/13/build-service-cheat-sheet/)


"Last week I had some discussions with colleagues about the build service and Berthold and Darix suggested to create some kind of reference card for the build service.  So, Iâ€™ve sat down, learned how others do sheat cheets, e.g. via XML or in OpenOffice.org and then decided to go the easy route with columns using an OpenOffice.org text document.  The first version is now available for download. It describes building packages for Factory, reviewing of package submissions, maintenance, package editing, miscellaneous commands and osc installation. The file is supposed to be printed on two sides of a paper â€“ and then cut the paper to A5."

"My flatmates and I are moving to another place. Actually, it's a place that is very close to the previous one, so we will still live in the center of Madrid. Basically the place is a bit better, with less traffic noise, and we now have a big terrace to enjoy the summer better!  However, the move is turning a bit irritating because it has coincided with the Q1 timeline of our project and I'm becoming crazy trying to give my best with both things. This move was planned even before I joined Novell; if I had joined before, maybe I would have preferred to stay in the previous place because now it's very likely that I move to Cambridge (MA) on October of this year."

####  [#310516: YaST2 DNSSEC](https://features.opensuse.org/310516)


"With the root zone now being signed, DNSSEC is finally seeing adoption. It would be really nice for YaST to be able to generate a signed zone."  


####  [#310517: DKIM and DomainKeys support](https://features.opensuse.org/310517)


"DKIM is now widely adopted by all major E-Mail providers and is considered a key check in anit-spam systems. While many people and organizations deploy one of the big integrated mail solutions or use a hosted solution, some just want good, old, plain SMTP. We should help these people, to get highest level of security directly with their operating system of choice."  


####  [#310518: Make openSUSE 11.4 12.0](https://features.opensuse.org/310518)


"Since going from SUSE 9 to 10, going to the next major version happened after xx.3. openSUSE 11.4 will come after 11.3, so it should follow this pattern. If this became permanent, then with the release cycle one could always predict what release and when."  


####  [#310530: 4 Options for better SUSE install and backup flexibility](https://features.opensuse.org/310530)


"I would like to see the same installation flexibility for SUSE as is available for Ubuntu and Fedora.  SUSE uses a wonderfully polished installer, however, the following features are either missing or I am not informed on how to use the following, which I think would be a great addition to SUSE distro and suse studio for the average or even small business user. (...)"  


####  [#310532: Using the torrent protocol in package manager](https://features.opensuse.org/310532)


"I believe talk about the benefits of the torrent protocol is not necessary.  Integrating the torrent in yast (or directly in libzypp), will also reduce the bandwidth consumption of servers, improving the speed of many users.It would be possible to use all of the servers contained in metalink and add them as seed. (...)"  


####  [#310560: Server Download Option for 11.4+](https://features.opensuse.org/310560)


"I am sure this may have been proposed before, but just in case I think it is a good move if the SUSE project would consider the following...  #Proposal Break 11.4+ distributions into the following downloadable images from the opensuse.org site..."  


####  [#310563: Dashboard Install GUI](https://features.opensuse.org/310563)


"Create a dashboard install on the DVD at the installation screen to help new users better understand the install options available to them. By this I mean where the selections come up to install Gnome, KDE, etc. that a dashboard listing replace it showing the Gnome, KDE, LXDE, XCFE, JeOS, Server, and Server/Server GUI as separate icons rather than a drop down list to select. Additionally, as the user scrolls across the icon it would give them a a summary description of the type of system it will install and possibly a screenshot or two to see if they will like it visually. Then as the install proceeds the user can customize the package selection later as is currently part of the system."

####  [Bryen Yunashko: A Great Weekend in Columbus at the Ohio Linux Fest](http://feedproxy.google.com/%7Er/Bryen/%7E3/S6MLBhvOYCE/)


"The weekend has come and gone and Iâ€™ve had a great weekend at the Ohio Linux Fest in Columbus, Ohio. A bit busy and intense at times as I was wearing my two hatsâ€¦ both representing openSUSE and representing GNOME-A11y.  So, I got there on Friday morning and checked out the only two sessions I could make time to see for the whole weekend. Unfortunately, ASL interpreters I had arranged for to assist me over the weekend had backed out so I was very lost communication-wise for the most part during the weekend. But I perseveredâ€¦.  I checked out the sessions led by Mel Chua (Red Hatâ€™s Community Education Engineer) and Robyn Bergeron (Fedora Marketing lead). I had befriended both of them just a couple of months earlier at the Community Leadership Summit. Even though I wasnâ€™t going to have an interpreter present, I went to see both sessions because Iâ€™m always supportive of those whom I know and go to their sessions as a show of support whenever I can."

####  [TWUUG: Linux File Structure](http://www.twuug.org/mediawiki/index.php/Linux_File_Structure)


"There are many differences between Linux and a MS-Windows system, but the most noticeable and beneficial is the file system. In Linux we do not use drive letters to symbolize different partitions or drives. Under Linux, there is one main directory the / or root directory. You can relate this to the C: drive under MS-Windows. Each directory can be a directory or a mounted partition.  The main directory is called the root directory, and it's denoted with a single slash (/). This concept may seem strange, but it actually makes life easy for you when you want to add more space. As an example, lets say you are running out of space in your home directory, in Linux you can hook a new hard drive up to your computer, copy the files from your home directory to it and mount it as your /home directory. This functionality allows a lot less modification and trouble when expanding your system." 


  







###  For Developers and Programmers





####  [HowtoForge/Falko Timme: Installing PHP5 Debugger On OpenSUSE 11.3](http://www.howtoforge.com/installing-php5-debugger-on-opensuse-11.3)


"This tutorial shows how to install php5 debugger (xdebug) on OpenSUSE 11.3.  I suppose you have installed Apache2 and PHP5 packages through zypper or yast. If not, please run: 


zypper install php5 apache2 apache2-mod_php5


The reason I use xdebug is, as far as I know now, xdebug supports php 5.3 or above. (...)"  


####  [Benjamin Weber: Java Abuse: Inline instanceof](http://benjiweber.co.uk/blog/2010/09/16/java-abuse-inline-instanceof/)


"One annoyance in Java is having to do instanceof checks on multiple lines. e.g.  if (object instanceof Foo) { Foo foo = (Foo)object; foo.foo(); }  While this is often a sign of a design failure, there are times when instanceof checks are required often due to framework constraints etc. The above is quite ugly and involves using 3 lines instead of 1 for a single method call. If foo() is a void method we canâ€™t even use the ternary ? : operator to make it more concise."  


####  [Ladislav Slezak: Debugging Ruby on Rails Application](http://lslezak.blogspot.com/2009/05/degugging-ruby-on-rails-application.html)


"How to debug a Ruby on Rails application?  I needed to debug a Ruby on Rails application which I just have started to develop. I put some logging commands to the code but it's not as good as using a full debugger for inspecting internal data at runtime.  **What's needed?** For debugging a Rails application ruby-debug gem is needed. It can be installed by command sudo gem install ruby-debug in Linux or as a package from an installation repository."  


####  [Ladislav Slezak: Renaming a Rake task](http://lslezak.blogspot.com/2009/06/renaming-rake-task.html)


"Rake has a class for creating packaging task which builds a compressed package from the sources. It's called Rake::PackageTask and it's quite easy to use it, see the documentation.  Unfortunately the name of the created task is package and it's hardcoded so it cannot be changed.  Yast uses make and the standard targets are package and package-local." 


  







###  For System Administrators





####  [Pascal Bleser: My dot Xdefaults](http://dev-loki.blogspot.com/2010/09/my-dot-xdefaults.html)


"~/.Xdefaults is the configuration file for all X applications and while most nowadays provide configuration interfaces, some can only be configured there. rxvt-unicode is one of them, but it's probably the fastest X terminal emulator available today, both in terms of startup and render times. It is also exceptionally good at rendering unicode.  The default colors in terminals are quite.. well, let's say "flashy" and not necessarily sweet on the eye, to say the least. Some months ago, I ran over an Xdefaults configuration for rxvt-unicode that changes those colors to a nice-on-the-eye, consistent set of darker colors, which fit exceptionally well in a terminal with a black background. Unfortunately, I don't have the URL any more, and all credits go to the original author."  


####  [Jigish Gohil: On-Access virus scanning on openSUSE 11.3](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/09/14/on-access-virus-scanning-on-opensuse-11-3/)


"One of the most useful deployment scenario for Linux in enterprise or educational environment is a fileserver with on access virus scanning, to serve Windows PCs on the network of course. Long ago there used to be samba-vscan that worked very nicely, it went missing in openSUSE 11.2 so dazuko kernel module worked in its place. On 11.3 dazuko is no longer available, enter dazukofs.  DazukoFS is a stack-able filesystem for virus scanning, here is how it works:  Install clamav, clamav-db and dazukofs, dazukofs-kmp-yourkernelflavor via 1-click."

"This guide explains how to set up WebDAV with Apache2 on an OpenSUSE 11.3 server. WebDAV stands for Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning and is a set of extensions to the HTTP protocol that allow users to directly edit files on the Apache server so that they do not need to be downloaded/uploaded via FTP. Of course, WebDAV can also be used to upload and download files. (...)"

"For this post I want to share another policy from recent request from a customer. The project was to help them develop a way to have usage quotas set to a default value when a new user/person was added to Alfresco. (There is an important distinction between the two.) A few months ago I had a discussion about possible ways to implement this kind of functionality with a co-worker and had a few ideas brewing as we started the engagement."

They could be called "start menu," "launcher," etc. So please, bear with me through this post. Hopefully putting these menus side by side will help us make sense of what we use in order to launch applications on our operating systems.  It is important to understand these menus and the changes they have suffered over time. probably you will find valuable information that will aid us in making a better launcher application for openSUSE."

"Following the openSUSE strategy discussion I read some reasonable questions and comments like: Why do we invest time into that useless strategy discussion? What is the benefit of a strategy? Strategy is only for companies!  This is a follow up to my friend Jos' post about strategy.  **I love strategy!** (Strategy was one of my major subjects at university and a research focus of the chair I worked and taught over four years.) So I might be biased. Nevertheless I want to convince you share some of my thoughts."  


####  [Michal Marek: Another openSUSE kernel git repo](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/09/14/another-opensuse-kernel-git-repo/)


"The mirror of the openSUSE kernel-source repository has been around for several months already, now there is something new: A repository that is actually usable :-) . The current kernel-source repository is a series of patches managed in git, which has some upsides, like the ability to easily cherry-pick a patch and port it to a different branch or send it upstream. But it is quite painful if you want to work with the code itself and not with patch files. A task as simple as determining if drivers/â€¦/foo.c in openSUSE-11.3 has or does not have a certain change requires checking out the branch and running the sequence-patch script to be able to look at the file. If you need to know when was the file changed, you have to run â€˜quilt patches <file>â€™ to find out what patches touched the file and then ask git about the history of these patches. Neither convenient nor efficient. Thatâ€™s why we have a second repository, that contains the mainline tree with all the suse patches applied. Itâ€™s located at [http://gitorious.org/opensuse/kernel](http://gitorious.org/opensuse/kernel), the clone url is git://gitorious.org/opensuse/kernel.git."  


####  [Duncan Mac-Vicar: The future of KDE instant messaging is happening now](http://duncan.mac-vicar.com/blog/archives/771#utm_source=feed&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=feed)


"Almost nine years passed since the first lines of Kopete code started to take form, in a remote country in the south part of the globe.  Still today, looking at an old Kopete screenshot has a special meaning for me. I had so much fun. I learned hundred of tricks and certainly it shaped me as a developer. Working with brilliant hackers across the world brought this multicultural curiosity. Both things combined resulted in myself living in a different country, married to a woman from yet another one, and having friend parties where almost everyone was from a different place, and working in a company involved in this great hobby.  However the world was different by then. At that point the discussion was whether you ICQed or you sent viruses via MSN. And the most difficult challenge was to get file transfer done right. Nothing of that matters anymore."  


####  [Luc Verhaegen: The linux desktop is dead!](http://libv.livejournal.com/22502.html)


"Or so it will be, soon, if these guys get their way.  Apparently, and this has been the hot new idea for the last year or two; for Xserver 1.10 people want to get rid of one of the greatest things that XFree86 brought us, and one of the better changes that happened after the X.org fork: modular graphics drivers.  While the current proposal is simply to undo the modularization work of the mid-naughties (thanks jezza!), it immediately sparked the imagination of others to go even further (to which Alanc answered rather strikingly). But merging drivers back is in itself already a very damaging move."
