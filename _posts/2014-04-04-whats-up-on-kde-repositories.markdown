Dear KDE Users,

Maybe you have heard already about it from another openSUSE mailing list, a blog post or through our openSUSE community page on Google+, but the KDE repositories have been changed since last Tuesday. Below you will find the changes that were done based on the release of KDE 4.12.4.

**Why was this changes needed**

Based on a small discussion in the opensuse-kde mailinglist and feedback on our survey, we concluded that _the _majority is in favor of creating a single repository where we track the current KDE release.

**Where are my old KDE repositories **

The name for this repository will be **KDE:Current** and will initially be build for oS 12.3 and oS 13.1.

After the release of the KDE:Current repo, the repositories KDE:Release:XY have been cleaned and removed. Initially KDE:Current will be delivered with 4.12.4 as that the KDE 4.13 release is scheduled for mid April.

Also the repository KDE:Extra and KDE:Unstable:Extra will change as that some of the building targets (KDE:Release:XY) are disappearing and be replaced with KDE:Current.

**Where should I find the new KDE repositories**

The KDE Repository page [KDE repositories](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:KDE_repositories) has been updated to reflect the changes. We would like to ask those that have been working on the localization of this page in other languages, to
update their pages as well.

Regards,

Raymond
