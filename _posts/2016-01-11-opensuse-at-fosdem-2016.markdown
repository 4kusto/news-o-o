Happy New Year Geekos


[![](https://fosdem.org/2016/support/promote/box.png)](https://fosdem.org/2016/)


It is mid-January and in a few days is [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2016/) time again. openSUSE will be there once again to show the entire Free Open Source Software community what openSUSE has achieved this past year. This year FOSDEM will take place at [ULB Campus Solbosch](https://www.ulb.ac.be/campus/solbosch/solbosch.html) on Saturday, Jan. 30 and Sunday, Jan. 31. If you  have some time to contribute at the booth, we would like you to volunteer [here](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:FOSDEM)

There will be plenty of swag and a specialty German brew from the beer capital of the world at the openSUSE booth to cure your weekend hangover(s).

FOSDEM is free and our openSUSE beer is 1€, so there is no excuse not to come see us and talk shop or talk about beer; we have experts in both at our booth.

For those of you lucky enough to live near Nuremberg, SUSE are sponsoring a coach bus that will be taking as many as they can from SUSE's HQ in Nuremberg to Brussels. Most of the people on the bus are staying at the NH City Centre or NH Stephanie hotels, so picking a hotel near there will be most convenient you take the bus. The bus will be leaving *promptly* at 10 a.m. on Friday, Jan. 29, and returning late on Sunday, Jan. 31. (it's a long drive, but a lot of fun). There are currently 14 seats available,please email Michael Haefner ([mhaefner@suse.de](mailto:mhaefner@suse.de)) if you're interested in coming along.
