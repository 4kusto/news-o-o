![Tumbleweed-black-green]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Tumbleweed-black-green-300x127.png)The latest [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) snapshot has updated [KDE Applications](https://www.kde.org/applications/) in the repositories to version [16.04.3](https://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-applications-16.04.3.php).

[Snapshot 20160724](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-07/msg00412.html) had a considerably large amount of package updates for Tumbleweed KDE users, but other updates in the snapshot included updates to kiwi-config-openSUSE, [Libzypp](https://github.com/openSUSE/libzypp/releases) to version 16.1.3, yast2-installation to version 3.1.202 and Kernel-firmware to 20160712.

Btrfsprogs also moved to version 4.6.1 in the snapshot, which fixed a long-standing bug that led to mixing data blocks into metadata block groups, according to the change log.

There were two Tumbleweed snapshots this week due to some infrastructure issues that slowed the normal Tumbleweed processes.

However, things are continuing to build and be tested and the next snapshot is expected to provide an update to TeXLive 2016. Linux Kernel 4.7 will not be in the next snapshot since it is still going through testing.

The previous snapshot from earlier in the week, [snapshot 20160720](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-07/msg00311.html), had relatively few updates. Gnome-sessions updated to 3.20.2, python-lxml to 3.6.0, purpose to 1.1, and there was one major version update for Virt-viewer to 4.0.
