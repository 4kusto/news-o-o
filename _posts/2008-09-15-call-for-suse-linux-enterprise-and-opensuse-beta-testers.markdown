categories:

In the "old days" SuSE had a closed list of beta testers that would help with SuSE Linux testing and try to help SuSE ensure the best possible Linux distribution. Many beta testers expressed an interest in joining the SUSE Linux Enterprise beta program as well. We're happy to announce that we have found a way to make this possible, and we'd like to expand the beta program to include new testers as well.

This week we will release the first beta of openSUSE 11.1 and begin the beta phase of SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop (SLED) 11 and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 11. While the products share a code base - and therefore testing of SUSE Linux Enterprise will benefit openSUSE in general - there are differences in package selection, workflow, and setup which require each product to be tested separately.

As always, we will be doing extensive testing of openSUSE 11.1 in public, but SLED and SLES will be tested in a private program.

If you're interested in openSUSE testing, please subscribe to the openSUSE-testing@opensuse.org mailing list [here](http://en.opensuse.org/Communicate/Mailinglists).

You can find additional information on testing openSUSE on the [wiki](http://en.opensuse.org/Testing).

If you'd like to be part of the SLED and SLES testing team, contact Holger Sickenberg <holgi at suse.de> with the following information:



	
  * Your Linux experience

	
  * Previous testing experience, if any

	
  * Areas you are interested in testing


We will select a group of qualified beta testers from the volunteers for SLED and SLES testing. As a thank you to those who participate in SLED, SLES, and openSUSE testing, we will provide SLED/SLES licenses to some testers, public recognition, and a couple of netbooks for outstanding work of testing SLED, SLES, and openSUSE.
