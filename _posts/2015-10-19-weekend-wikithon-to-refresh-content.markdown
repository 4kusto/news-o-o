[![hat]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/hat-300x300.jpg)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/hat.jpg)Leap comes out in 16 days, but before it does, openSUSE will have a Weekend Wikithon Oct. 24 and Oct. 25 to update, delete and refresh content on the [openSUSE wiki](https://en.opensuse.org/).

[Contributions](https://en.opensuse.org/Special:ActiveUsers) will be gauged and four contributors will receive an openSUSE Leap hat that have the most contributions between Â Oct. 24 and Oct. 25 in the following four categories:



	
  1. Contributor who updates the most content on the [features page](https://en.opensuse.org/Features) for the upcoming release of Leap 42.1

	
  2. Contributor who updates the most screenshots on the [screenshots page](https://en.opensuse.org/Screenshots) to Leap 42.1

	
  3. Contributor who makes the most contributions to the [42.1 portal](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:42.1)

	
  4. Contributor who deletes the most irrelevant content on the openSUSE wiki.


Communication for the event will take place on the Freenode IRC opensuse-marketing channel.
