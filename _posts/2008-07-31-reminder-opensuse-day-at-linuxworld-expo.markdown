Join the openSUSE Project for a day of fun and FOSS at the LinuxWorld Expo! On Wednesday, August 6th, the openSUSE Project will be holding its first "openSUSE Day" in North America, in conjuction with the LinuxWorld Expo at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.

We'll have a full day of presentations about the openSUSE Project, KDE, GNOME, the Linux kernel, the openSUSE Build Service, and much more.

Come by and learn all about openSUSE, pick up an openSUSE 11.0 DVD and some of the fabulous door prizes -- We'll be giving away two Chumby's and tons of openSUSE swag -- including openSUSE t-shirts, caps, and other big prizes.

The schedule runs from 9:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., including an openSUSE Birds of a Feather at 4:15 p.m. See the full schedule at: [http://en.opensuse.org/OpenSUSE_Day_at_LinuxWorld_Expo](http://en.opensuse.org/OpenSUSE_Day_at_LinuxWorld_Expo).

Attendance is free, and if you're registered you also have access to the show expo floor. To register, go to [http://linuxworldexpo.com/live/12/register//SN335015](http://linuxworldexpo.com/live/12/register//SN335015). Select the openSUSE Community Day and sign up.
