On Monday, Google announced the accepted projects for all of the Google Summer of Code organizations. The openSUSE Project has [nine projects](http://socghop.appspot.com/org/home/google/gsoc2009/opensuse) that were accepted for the Summer of Code 2009.





The following students have had projects accepted:







  * Eryu Guan: Porting openSUSE to MIPS platform


  * Marcus Huewe: Integrating oauth into the openSUSE Build Service


  * Peter Libic: Prototype git backend for OpenSUSE Build Service


  * Kusum Madarasu: openSIS-MySQL


  * Jan-Simon MÃ¶ller: Porting openSUSE to ARM platform


  * Udit Sajjanhar: OpenID Support for openSUSE Build Service


  * Jeffrey Shantz: YaST Education Module


  * Peter Somlo: Synchronization with Mobile Devices


  * Mohit Verma: NLP+Voice UI system for the openSUSE desktop


 


Of course, we received more than nine excellent proposals. While we couldn't accept every proposal that we'd have liked, we'd like to thank all of the students who submitted proposals.





Also, a big thanks to all of the mentors who have volunteered to mentor, worked with students to answer questions about proposals, and provide guidance so far.





The next step is the [Community Bonding Period](http://googlesummerofcode.blogspot.com/2007/04/so-what-is-this-community-bonding-all.html) to help students get acclimated with the project and learn how to work within the openSUSE Project. Some of our students are already long-standing members of the community, but please give all of them a warm welcome and any assistance they need in getting started.





Coding starts officially on May 23rd. Let's get ready to have a great summer!
