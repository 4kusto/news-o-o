The openSUSE-Education Add On for openSUSE 11.0 is ready! Big steps compared to the [10.3 release](//news.opensuse.org/2008/06/18/announcing-opensuse-education-for-103/):



	
  * Better LTSP integration: now [Easy-LTSP](http://en.opensuse.org/Easy-LTSP) helps you to configure your whole [LTSP](http://www.ltsp.org/) server with one graphical tool and the clients can run local applications like Firefox to save resources on the LTSP server.

	
  * Many package updates and new applications (the repository contains >1300 packages now!) - please have a look at the [current patterns](http://en.opensuse.org/Education/Repositories#Select_Patterns_and_Packages) on your local machine to see the big improvement.

	
  * Direct integration into the community repositories - with "Education" being part of the "YaST2 - Software Repositories" module the online repository is just one click away.

	
  * Separate online update repository: if you like, just enable the education update repository to get the latest updates of your education applications.

	
  * Complete new structure for the development of the next openSUSE-Education releases. Please have a [look at the mailing list](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-edu/2008-09/msg00024.html) to get a short overview.
