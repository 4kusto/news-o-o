We're very, very close to the final release of openSUSE 11.2!

To help promote the 11.2 release, we have [banners for openSUSE 11.2 available](http://en.opensuse.org/Buttons_and_Banners#Banners_for_11.2) on the openSUSE wiki, courtesy of Jakub Steiner (jimmac). They're available in most standard ad sizes for the Web, so you should be able to find one to fit your blog or site.

When openSUSE 11.2 is released you can link to the openSUSE.org home page or to the download page for 11.2 directly.

Take a look - they're quite good! (And no, 11.2 isn't "out now" just yet. Unless you're reading this on Thursday after the release, or later...)
