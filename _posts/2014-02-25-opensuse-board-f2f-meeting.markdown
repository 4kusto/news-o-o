There are plenty of opportunities to help the project. The booth boxesÂ are right around the corner and with this a reboot of the advocate andÂ local coordinator effort.

We have also reach agreement to re-instate the reimbursement of locallyÂ produced materials. We'll create some guidelines and a new team needs toÂ be formed. We hope that with some modification to the TSP app bothÂ reimbursement streams can be handled in a similar way.




We all feel we got a lot of stuff sorted out and ready to roll. AsÂ always if you have questions or concerns please feel free to send aÂ message to _board at o.o_

Have a great week!
