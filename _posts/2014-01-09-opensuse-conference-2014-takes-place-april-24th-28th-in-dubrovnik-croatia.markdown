As [announced at the openSUSE Conference 2013](https://news.opensuse.org/2013/07/22/opensuse-conference-2013-3rd-day/), this years openSUSE conference will take place in Dubrovnik, Croatia. This beautiful city will welcome us Geekos from the 24th to the 28th of April. The team has been hard at work to prepare things and below they start by giving you a taste of the city, the venue and themselves!


## The openSUSE Conference


The openSUSE Conference is the annual gathering of the openSUSE Community and other Free and Open Source contributors and enthusiasts. This year will be the 6th event where the talks, workshops and discussions provide the framework to exchange knowledge, collaborate and create lasting connections and incredible memories. Last year our event took place in Greece - read reports on [day one](https://news.opensuse.org/2013/07/20/opensuse-conference-2013-the-conference-begins/), [day two](https://news.opensuse.org/2013/07/21/opensuse-conference-2013-2nd-day/) and [day three](https://news.opensuse.org/2013/07/22/opensuse-conference-2013-3rd-day/). Before we've [had a smashing time in Prague](https://news.opensuse.org/2013/01/21/the-opensuse-conference-a-few-months-later/) and [in a old factory hall in NÃ¼remberg](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/09/15/opensuse-conference-fun/).



## The theme this year


The openSUSE conference traditionally has a theme. This year, the theme is: "**The Strength to Change**".

Change has been a constant in Free Software. With the rise of mobile devices and the associated operating systems like Android and Chromebooks, we have to adopt as a project. We discussed strategy again on our mailing lists and by the time of the conference, we can hopefully all talk together and come to some conclusions. Change is never easy, but it is important!



### Subjects and conference schedule


Like always, we will cover a wide range of subjects at the event. This year, there will be the following tracks:


  * End user track


  * Business track


  * Community and Project


  * Technology & Development


More details are coming in the Call for Papers on the 20th of January, with proposals starting to get accepted February 14. The submission period will end on February 28.

## Croatia and Dubrovnik


Republic of Croatia is a unitary democratic parliamentary republic at the crossroads of Central Europe, Balkans, and the Mediterranean. It joined the EU on 1st of July 2013, and it is best known for itâ€™s sunny beaches, islands and warm adriatic sea as it is a summer vacation destination for many Europeans.

Dubrovnik is the southernmost city in Croatia, a gorgeous former city state which joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in 1979. The prosperity of the city of Dubrovnik was historically based on maritime trade. As the capital of the Republic of Ragusa, a maritime republic, the city achieved a high level of development, particularly during the 15th and 16th centuries. Dubrovnik became notable for its wealth and skilled diplomacy. The Republic was an early adopter of what are now regarded as modern laws and institutions and Dubrovnik became a cradle of Croatian literature. The city successfully balanced its sovereignty between the interests of Venice and the Ottoman Empire for centuries.

## Local Community

The team has support from the UNIDU (which is where the event will take place) and is also backed by the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing of University of Zagreb.

The leadership of the core team:



	
  * Svebor PrstaÄiÄ‡, president of HrOpen

	
  * Tomo Sjekavica, assistant professor at UNIDU

	
  * Ivan GuÅ¡tin, president of HULK

## The conference venue


The conference venue is provided by the University of Dubrovnik, (UNIDU). The University of Dubrovnik is the '_youngest_' university in Croatia. It was established in 2003 on the foundations of a very long tradition which goes back to the 17th century, but also on decades of modern higher education. In terms of program, organization and technical equipment, the University of Dubrovnik stands among the most modern of educational institutions.

The venue, called the New Campus, is situated just 5 minutes walk from the Dubrovnik old town, and is in walking distance of many hotels and private apartments that offer affordable accommodation deals. It was originally built as a hospital, then renewed and repurposed for the University in 2012. From the outside it displays the soul of Dubrovnik, but from the inside it is a very sleek and modern design.
