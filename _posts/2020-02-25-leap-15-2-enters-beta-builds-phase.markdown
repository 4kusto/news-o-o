[openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) [Leap](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Leap) 15.2 entered the Beta phase last week and has already released two snapshots with the release of [build 581.2](https://openqa.opensuse.org/tests/overview?distri=opensuse&version=15.2&build=581.2&groupid=50) and [build 588.2](https://openqa.opensuse.org/tests/overview?distri=opensuse&version=15.2&build=588.2&groupid=50). Leap has a rolling development model until it's final build, so multiple builds will be released according to the [road map](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Roadmap) until the gold master is released, which is scheduled for May 7.

There are no concrete milestones in the rolling development model. As bugs are fixed and new packages introduced or excluded, snapshots of the latest beta phase builds will be released once they pass[ openQA](https://openqa.opensuse.org/group_overview/50) testing.

After the gold master is released, the rolling development model will stop and maintenance and security updates will then be released for the new minor version of the Leap 15 series.

The alpha phase has been ongoing for several months now and builds have been released regularly on a rolling basis. The alpha was stable enough to use for demos at FOSDEM, but testing is still needed.

Distro hoppers, hobbyists, users and tech enthusiast can download the current builds and help test the releases at [software.opensuse.org/distributions/testing](https://software.opensuse.org/distributions/testing). People testing the beta are encouraged to

Record their Leap Beta testing effort on the following spreadsheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AGKijKpKiJCB616-bHVoNQuhWHpQLHPWCb3m1p6gXPc/edit#gid=801313279](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AGKijKpKiJCB616-bHVoNQuhWHpQLHPWCb3m1p6gXPc/edit#gid=801313279)

Leap Beta testers have an option to receive a T-shirt, so make sure to fill in all the proper information and bug reports to get one.

In the [email announcement](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2020-02/msg00429.html?fbclid=IwAR2Q_vSZi6XrNb_xHuzuvh3fPFxvun-xdxl2TzsgHXqg2homk5u8sdzP3-c) notifying the community about Leap entering the beta phase, Leap’s new release manager, Luboš Kocman stated the release team is working on a 15.1 upgrade test suite to get decent upgrade test results.

“So any manual upgrade effort would be extremely valuable,” Luboš Kocman wrote.

Kocman also highlighted [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:WSL) and said the hard work put in for WSL images has risen it to a first-class citizen in both the [Open Build Service](https://openbuildservice.org/) and [openQA](http://open.qa/).

Those interested in Beta testing of openSUSE Leap 15.2 WSL images can contact Kocman or the factory mailing list. For more information on WSL, visit [https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:WSL](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:WSL).
