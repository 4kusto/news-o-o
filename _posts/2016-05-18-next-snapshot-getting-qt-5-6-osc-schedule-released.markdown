Since the last openSUSE Tumbleweed update, there have been three snapshots, but the next snapshot is the one many users are waiting for because it will include [Qt 5.6](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_5.6_Release).

The hold up has taken some time to be released because a minor fix, but any snapshot dated 20160517 or higher will have the [Qt 5.6](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_5.6_Release).

There are a few other exciting packages in staging that could soon arriveÂ in follow on Tumbleweed snapshots like [Plasma 5.6](https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.6.0.php), [Plasma Framework 5.22.0](https://www.kde.org/info/kde-frameworks-5.22.0.php) and [KDE Applications 16.04.1](https://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-applications-16.04.1.php). The [4.6 Linux Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/) was also checked in to staging recently.

What has already been released in the repositories in recent Tumbleweed snapshots is [GNOME 3.20.2](https://help.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/3.20/) and [Linux Kernel 4.5.4](https://www.kernel.org/) from the [20160516](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-05/msg00254.html) snapshot. [Libzypp](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Libzypp) updated to major version 16.0.0.

Snapshot [20160514](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-05/msg00235.html) and [20160512](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-05/msg00213.html) had a few package changes that updated translations for many of the new package updates.

The live installer was dropped from Tumbleweed. People can get live images, but there is no installer.
