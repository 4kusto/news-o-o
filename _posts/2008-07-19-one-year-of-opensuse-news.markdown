title: "One Year of openSUSE News"
---
Exactly one year ago the [openSUSE News site went live](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-announce/2007-07/msg00004.html) to provide users with the latest news and an event calendar. 19 authors posting under their own names and some one-time contributors wrote 246 stories (of which 122 were [submitted to Digg](http://digg.com/search?s=news.opensuse.org&submit=Search&section=news&type=url&area=all&sort=most)) and filled the calendar with [170 entries](https://news.opensuse.org/category/events/event-calendar/). With the integration of the news feed into the Wiki and the release announcements the generated traffic grew and the site is now one of the busiest sites hosted by Novell.
