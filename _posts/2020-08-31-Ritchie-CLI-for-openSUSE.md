Ritchie is an open source tool developed from [ZUP Company](https://opensource.zup.com.br/) that allows you to create, store and share automations securely. It also optimizes repetitive commands so you have more programming autonomy. As a member of the openSUSE community, I make the [packages](https://software.opensuse.org/package/ritchie-cli) available to all openSUSE users.

How does Ritchie work?

In a general context, the common process for executing a project is to create a whole previous infrastructure, defining a language in the system that will be programmed, downloading dependencies and defining the rules that should be used for the project.

With Ritchie, it's possible to define this configuration using a formula, creating this infrastructure directly by a command line, which in this case will delivered all the structure of the project with all files automatically configured. That helps on avoiding an important time spent on infrastructure and configurations.

Less bureaucracy, more independence : Developers have more autonomy to work on their projects, with less interference from other areas. See an example in the illustration below:
