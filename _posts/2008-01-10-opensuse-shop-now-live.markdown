We proudly announce [shop.openSUSE.org](http://shop.opensuse.org/). This is the place to find official openSUSE gear: T-shirts, mugs, caps, bags and more are available.

As many times requested by the community the shop will fulfill the need to offer openSUSE branded gear to a large audience at a reasonable price. The shop itself is driven by an external shop provider who offers us a broad variety of different products to sell. We are bound to his selection. If you wanna see more or other products out there or just want to give us feedback please contact us at shop@opensuse.org

Have a lot of fun!
