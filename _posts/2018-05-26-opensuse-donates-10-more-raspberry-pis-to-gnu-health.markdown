![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_1560-1-300x225.jpg)The [openSUSE Project](https://www.opensuse.org/) once again donated 10 [Raspberry Pis](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) to [GNU Health Project](http://health.gnu.org/), which were handed over to the project’s founder Luis Falcon at the [openSUSE Conference](https://events.opensuse.org/) today.

Last year, the openSUSE Project [donated 10 Raspberry Pis](https://news.opensuse.org/2017/03/13/gnu-health-opensuse-pioneer-shift-in-healthcare-management/) to the non-profit,[ non-government organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization) (NGO) that delivers free open-source software for health practitioners, health institutions and governments worldwide.

The affordable [ARM](https://www.arm.com/) hardware that was donated last year were distributed to Italy, India, Cameroon, Germany, Spain and Argentina to improve healthcare management and patient care. Some were also used to improve development on the platform.

GNU Health’s free software provides functionality to facilitate a[ Hospital Information System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_information_system) (HIS),  Health Information System and[ Electronic Medical Record](https://www.healthit.gov/providers-professionals/electronic-medical-records-emr) (EMR) management.

Both Falcon and Axel Braun gave talks at the openSUSE Conference about GNU Health and how it is changing [digital ecosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_ecosystem) and benefiting communities on a global scale.

More talks about GNU Health and its Raspberry Pis are expected to be discussed at the [GNU Health Conference](http://www.gnuhealthcon.org/) in November, which openSUSE is sponsoring this year.

Users of openSUSE can install GNU Health as part of the official release of openSUSE Leap 15 at [software.opensuse.org](https://software.opensuse.org/).
