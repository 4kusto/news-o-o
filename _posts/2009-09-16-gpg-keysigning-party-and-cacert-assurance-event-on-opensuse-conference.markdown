This Thursday 16:45 - 17:30 will be a [GPG-Keysigning Party](http://en.opensuse.org/OpenSUSE_Conf_2009_KSP) and a [CaCert Assurance Event](https://www.cacert.org/) at the openSUSE Conference Unconference track in NÃ¼rnberg. So even if the deadline for the GPG key submission is already over, it might be a good idea to visit the Event and [become a CaCert member](https://www.cacert.org/index.php?id=1&lang=en_AU) (please create your CaCert Account first)!

So just jump into your favorite vehicle and [visit us](http://conference.opensuse.org/getting-there/) at the openSUSE-Conference!
