The openSUSE Project has been very busy this week. The project shared a booth with SUSE at the [Supercomputing Conference](//sc15.supercomputing.org) in Austin, Texas, this week.

The theme (see photo above) caught the attention of the attendees and those stopping by the booth could get a lightsaber for watching our presentations or playing a retro Sega Star Wars from 1994 running on openSUSE Leap 42.1.

SC15 really put things into perspective on how scientists, physicists and sysadmins use the Geeko distribution for simulations, Exascale computing and High Performance Computing and system management.

Several attendees expressed interest in ARM and the timing was perfect to let the attendees know that openSUSE released a port of openSUSE Leap 42.1 to AArch64, which is installable on the AMD, APM and Cavium SoCs (Seattle, X-Gene, ThunderX). There is also sharing the SLE12 SP1 ARM enablement for those hardware platforms, but providing the full Leap package set.


#### Hack Week


In three weeks, openSUSE/SUSE hackers will experiment without limits! That’s right, we will have Hack Week from Dec. 7 - 11. This Hack Week 13, which I’ll nickname Hack Week 7/11, is all about bringing innovation to the project and exploring the possibility of making ideas a reality. Anyone can participate. Just visit [https://hackweek.suse.com/](https://hackweek.suse.com/), sign up for a project you like or create a new project and recruit participants to hack with you.


#### Tumbleweed


Tumbleweed is once again finding a rhythm for the release of its snapshots. This week there were three snapshots and its possible there might be a fourth before the end of the week.

The three snapshots this week brought [GNOME 3.18.2](https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2015-November/msg00008.html), [KDE Applications 15.08.03](https://techbase.kde.org/Schedules/Applications/15.08_Release_Schedule#Tuesday.2C_November_10.2C_2015:_KDE_Applications_15.08.3_release) and several other fixes.

In the next snapshot, expect new default system fonts, [X.Org 1.18](//www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Xorg-Server-1.18) and [Mesa 11.0.5](//news.softpedia.com/news/mesa-11-0-5-3d-graphics-library-patches-intel-and-nouveau-video-drivers-more-496049.shtml). [Ghostscript 9.18](//www.ghostscript.com/doc/9.18/News.htm) is also expected, but it did cause a few build failures in stagings, so if you’re building anything against it, be forewarned.

There are some projects in Factory staging we need your help with before they will be released in a Tumbleweed snapshot.

Dominique Leuenberger wrote in the [Tumbleweed weekly review](//lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2015-11/msg00550.html) email that some expect issues with the new [Boost version 1.59](//www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_59_0.html) and that there are quick a few fixes needed. [GStreamer 1.6](//gstreamer.freedesktop.org/releases/1.6/) has most of the packages ready, but some the critical component Phonon is missing. 

With all this, I wish you a great weekend – and always remember: Have a
lot of fun.
