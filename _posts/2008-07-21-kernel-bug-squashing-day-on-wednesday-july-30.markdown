The kernel team is going to be hosting a kernel bug squashing day on [Wednesday, July 30th](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-announce/2008-07/msg00017.html). The goals of the bug squashing day are to:



	
  * Reduce the number of kernel bugs in openSUSE's bugzilla

	
  * Get rid of old / invalid bugs in bugzilla and find duplicates

	
  * Send patches and bugs upstream

	
  * Test and review fixes for kernel bugs


If you're interested in helping, join the kernel team on #opensuse-kernel on [irc.freenode.net](irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-kernel).They'll be at it all day on Wednesday, July 30th starting at 00:00 UTC -- so all time zones have equal opportunity to participate!
