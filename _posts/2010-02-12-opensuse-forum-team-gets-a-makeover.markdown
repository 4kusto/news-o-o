The openSUSE Forum Team of Administrators and Moderators has had an overhaul following a review by the openSUSE board. The new team can be reviewed here: [Forum team](http://en.opensuse.org/Forum_Team). The forum review has brought about the establishment of a New Administrator Triad who whilst working largely as Moderators will also act as the first point of contact between the openSUSE board and the forum team. Kim Kgroneman [Kim](http://en.opensuse.org/User:Kgroneman) will act as Technical Administrator, dealing with the overall web side function of the openSUSE forum. Users of the forum will also notice a number of new Global Moderators, who have been carefully selected for their outstanding participation and reputation in the forum. 
New language forums have been recently established and have a compliment of Forum Moderators. Improvements in the Wiki: [Revamp the openSUSE Wiki](http://news.opensuse.org/2009/12/22/under-construction-new-wiki-underway/) has had huge forum user involvement and a new section in the forum has been established for the Wiki: [Wiki Forum Section](http://forums.opensuse.org/opensuse-wiki-discussions/).
A huge thank you goes out to Rupert [Rupert HorstkÃ¶tter](http://en.opensuse.org/User:Rhorstkoetter) who assisted the review process.
