![summit es](/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/summit-es.jpg)The openSUSE Summit team has been working hard over the last weeks to add Spanish translations to the website. As the openSUSE  Summit is meant to be an 'Americas' event, we aim to create a dual-language conference, accommodating both the Spanish and English speaking visitors. The exact language distribution of talks will strongly depends on the talks submitted, so we'd urge our Spanish speaking community to [submit talk proposals in Spanish](//summit.opensuse.org/es/Convocatoria-para-la-Presentacion-de-Ponencias/)!
