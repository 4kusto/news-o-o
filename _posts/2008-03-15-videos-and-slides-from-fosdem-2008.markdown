The videos and slides of the openSUSE presentations at [FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org) are now online, and available at the [FOSDEM2008](http://opensuse.org/FOSDEM2008) wiki page. 

They are also available on [Google video](http://video.google.co.uk/videosearch?q=FOSDEM2008&sitesearch=video.google.com) (lower quality).

Huge thanks goes to [Thomas Schmidt](http://en.opensuse.org/User:Digitaltomm) and Juergen Weigert for making it all possible.
