Every year we hear from people who did not know when or where the openSUSE Conference took place. This is a problem in urgent need of fixing. We need you to help us tell them! Everybody can help promote our conference. There are great banners and other graphics you can put on blogs, twitter, facebook and many other places. Be a part of oSC14, help us tell everybody about oSC14!<!-- more -->



## Logo and stuff


We've got some great promotional images for the openSUSE conference. On the right is a website banner, and you can find plenty of different shapes and sizes by clicking on it. Below we have a folding tux - very cool. The PDF you get by clicking on it (has a white background) can be printed, ideally on A3 and a bit stronger-than-normal paper. You then cut it out following the lines, fold it - and you have your own tuxy promoting oSC14!

Of course we have our [awesome logo](http://is.gd/dIEkWy), I'm sure you have seen it before. We also have a really nice poster, great for hanging up at events you are going to.
