Sorry, but we expect our main mailing-lists server (lists.opensuse.org) and our features server (features.opensuse.org) to stay down for some more minutes than expected: the systems reported a file system corruption and running a file system check right now.

Expected recovery time: **Thu May 26 12:00:00 CEST 2011**

We apologize for any inconvenience.
