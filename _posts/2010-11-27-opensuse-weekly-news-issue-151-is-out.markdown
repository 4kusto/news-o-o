####  [#310848: Allow select multiple in Package Manager (YaST module)](https://features.opensuse.org/310848)




"Now I can select only 1 or only all packages in YaST package manager.  

 It would be logical to allow to mark several packages (more than 1, not all) by pressing Shift, Ctrl.  

 The marked packages could be manipulated with the same task: I select 3 packages, press right mouse, select to install (uninstall/tabu) these 3 packages." 




####  [#310855: Gnome Environment](https://features.opensuse.org/310855)




"I often hear complains from users about the Gnome Environment,not its ability to work but the design of that,people love the 2 bar on Gnome Environment and I was thinking if we could change it on the upcoming 11.4. The currently Gnome menu is not usable enough.At list you can change that and make it more like Mint. I know its really easy for a user to make that change but those are the things that attract users,especially the new ones." 




####  [#310856: don't remove custom grub entries](https://features.opensuse.org/310856)




"from [https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=648565](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=648565) (written by Nico Gruber):  

 Applying a kernel update will delete custom grub entries with this kernel and add a default one. (...)" 




####  [#310857: Fallback entry in GRUB for RAID systems](https://features.opensuse.org/310857)




"GRUB supports a "fallback" entry that is booted if the default kernel is not available or bootable.  

 In short: that's exactly what you want on a system with RAID (at least RAID1, not sure if other RAID types are supported. (...)" 




####  [#310858: add apache2-mod_wsgi](https://features.opensuse.org/310858)




"The package apache2-mod_python is discontinued. Please add apache2-mod_wsgi instead. Please add it to patterns-openSUSE-lamp_server." 




####  [#310866: Choose installation pattern on a the basis of type of usage](https://features.opensuse.org/310866)




"openSUSE DVD has a lot of well selected packages. Currently what we do is offer choices to the consumer by his choices of Desktop. I would like we also offer choices on the basis of their use." 




####  [#310869: Yast module to manage classpath and enviroment variables](https://features.opensuse.org/310869)




"There should a yast module which support managing and editing of classpaths and environment variables. This makes opensuse more user friendly when an application is extracted from tar files or it is compiled from sources." 




####  [#310870: Add WEEKLY_TIME for weekly crons](https://features.opensuse.org/310870)




"When running cron jobs some of them can increase IO heavily, slowing the system down, like suse-updatedb from findutils-locate, doing a large find on the filesystems. On production servers being used by several users, these scripts have to be started at non working hours.  

  

 In /etc/sysconfig/cron we already have a variable called DAILY_TIME which controls at what time the scripts in /etc/cron.daily are being started by /usr/lib/cron/run-crons .  

  

 A similar approach would be very useful for the weekly crons, allowing a better control of the day and time when weekly cron jobs are started."

"will be realy usefull a graphical environment for managing pendrive, where you can format, make partition, etc"

####  [Larry Finger: Weekly News for November 19](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-testing/2010-11/msg00028.html)




"The next Testing Core Team IRC meeting to discuss 11.4 Milestone 4 will be held December 6 at 1800 UTC.  

  

 The release of openSUSE 11.4 M4 has been delayed until Monday, November 29. The results of the automated testing implemented by Team member Bernhard Wiedermann indicated that Build 0906, which was a potential M4 candidate, was not suitable, but that Build 0908 would install without errors. Congratulations to Bernhard for his efforts. Trying to test a version that will not install is hardly the best way to encourage testing.  

  

 I have just begun to test M4 myself. Thus far, the NET install CD was used to upgrade from M3, and to build new installations on both real and virtual machines. My special interest is wireless networking - no serious problems found yet.  

  

 I hope the readers will test this version, and post bugs on the Novell Bugzilla."

My wife has many plans for me and I have some myself as well including changing diapers, some work at the house, celebrating christmas, showing off our kids to their grandparents, aunts and uncles, getting my son settled in the daycare, building a snow man¦  

  

 I hope some days of vacation will be in there as well so that I can be refreshed again when I return back to the Novell office to continue working for openSUSE.  

  

 Right now, I try to find some people that take over some of my responsibilities.(...)"

[http://el.opensuse.org/Weekly_news](http://el.opensuse.org/Weekly_news)  

  

 Today is a Great day for the Greek Community, today after two meetings we made to show all (including ourselves) that we were not just big fat words and that we can make things happen as a team that is bigger than 3 or 4 people. We know we are late, we were not in a hurry, we wanted it done correctly. We made it and we are really proud of it. When we started creating the Greek community many people told us that it would end up a great failure. Today we say to them:  

 -You Are Wrong.  

  

 We know we have road ahead of us, but Every great journey must start with one small step."

 After a really bad month for the economic point of view, i had to refocus all the goals of my company to jump out the hole where i fall thanks to the changes in the economy of my country (Venezuela), so i came out with the idea of give on-line courses about system security, hacking, pen-testing and that kind of stuff, including the usual Web Dev, Sys Admin courses.

The 2.6.36 kernel features concurrency-managed workqueues, preliminary support for the fanotify mechanism discussed here in the past, final merging of the AppArmor security system used by some distributions for many years, and support for a new architecture, among many dozens of other significant improvements. The new kernel received patches from over 1,100 engineers for a total of nearly 11,000 changesets (collections of related changes to various kernel files) overall. (...)"

"The automatic creation of process groups should keep the desktop interface responsive even when a large number of processes are making the CPU sweat. Meanwhile, the development of 2.6.37 is in full swing, and new stable kernels replace their predecessors; 2.6.35, on the other hand, has reached the end of its life. (...)"

####  [Linux.com/Jack Wallen: Creating Macros Without Scripting in LibreOffice and OpenOffice.org](http://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/380813-introduction-to-openoffice-macros)




"If you find yourself doing the same task over and over again in LibreOffice (or OpenOffice.org), you need to learn about macros. Whether it's inserting the same text over and over, formatting text, or any other task where multiple keystrokes or actions are necessary you can save time by creating a macro. LibreOffice (and OpenOffice.org before it) include an outstanding Macro tool that allows you to quickly create and manage macros that will ease the burden of repetitive tasks. (...)"

"Did you know that you only need MPlayer to record a live radio station? Use  

**mplayer http://ip:port/ -ao pcm:file=radio.wav -vo null -vc null**  

 to dump a radio.wav file of the audio stream. You can later convert it to MP3 using LAME or Audacity." 




####  [Usama Hashimi: GNU find “ A Multidimensional Tool](http://linux-blog.org/gnu-find-a-multidimensional-tool/)




"Beginners are mostly afraid of command prompt. Whenever they see a command prompt, they immediately say its very difficult. But it™s not true. The Command prompt is as friendly as GUI (Graphical User Interface), provided if you use it with proper procedure.  

  

 Most people use GUI tools to search for files. They don™t realize that they can use command line tools to search for them as well! GNU ˜find™ is such like a tool which can not only search files but can even copy, move or delete these files on the fly.  

  

 So let™s see that how ˜find™ works."

"strace is a useful little utility “ installed by default on most Linux systems “ which allows you to find out what a program is doing under the hood by tracing the system calls it's making. strace is a great basic debugging tool; but it's also fascinating to use even when you're not tracing a problem. It can teach you a lot about how a Linux program works. (...)"

Or maybe it's something on the desktop -- your browser has frozen and isn't responding. Or suddenly everything's gotten really slow and you're not sure why. And this happens every few days, and you're tired of it.

"As you probably know, I'm the one responsible for openSUSE Paste. So I'm receiving some requests for adding features and fixing thing and such. One of the request I received quite some time ago was from Sirko. He's artist and he's doing nice artwork. Sometimes he needs to quickly post what he has drawn somewhere to show it to the others and receive some feedback. He is currently using his own site, he could use some image pasting site, but he is our community member and he likes promoting openSUSE wherever he is, whatever he is doing. So I started working on image pasting support for our openSUSE Paste quite some time ago and this weekend I finally finished it. (...)"

 Now, my very personal 2 cents about it. Not the view of the entire openSUSE board, just me, from my very own experience and feelings.  

  

 So it's random conspiracy time again, not like we haven't been there before, did we (just google for "Novell Microsoft deal" and look at all those doomsday scenarios). (...)"

"In addition to supporting file system capabilities (fate#307254) I™ve also updated the permissions handling in 11.4 slightly.  

  

 There have been complaints that every SuSEconfig run also calls SuSEconfig.permissions which leads to changed file permissions at unexpected times. Therefore I™ve modified SuSEconfig.permissions to only actually set permissions when called explicitly (ie SuSEconfig “module permissions). When called by a generic SuSEconfig run SuSEconfig.permissions now only shows files with wrong permissions but doesn™t actually fix them anymore. (...)" 




####  [Andres Silva: openSUSE Needs to Rebel](http://anditosan.blogspot.com/2010/11/opensuse-needs-to-rebel.html)




"Over the course of a few years, and after openSUSE was launched, the relationship of openSUSE internally has been one of constant rediscovery and also lethargy. openSUSE heaveily relies on the power of the community and their votes on certain issues, features, etc. Simply put, openSUSE is democratic. In a sense, this means that openSUSE has developed a system that slows down the process of innovation and has become an acolyte of other Linux distributions such as Fedora and Ubuntu. Fedora, on the one hand, has the fairly advanced support from the Red Hat giant. A company that has enough capacity to make changes which are matured enough and set examples for other distributions to follow. Then Ubuntu has Mark Shuttleworth. A character with a strong personality and defying attitude to break the routine of being a "common" Linux distribution. (...)" 




####  [Kostas Koudaras: openSUSE: A difficult Distribution or a user-friendly distribution? (Part 1).](http://e-tote-kala.blogspot.com/2010/11/opensuse-difficult-distribution-or-user.html)




"Finally what kind of distribution is openSUSE? Is it a distribution that demands from the user to have some basic knowledge around Linux? is it a distribution unmanageable or by now its development has reached that level that has become a stable but yet friendly to the user of every level? Finally is openSUSE a distribution that you would recommend to a user that starts now with FOSS?  

 The easy way to write that article is to present you the advantages of the distribution noting for you that openSUSE is really the easiest distribution on the world.But something like that would not be interesting for no one and I believe neither it would convince anyone. Another way would be to emphasize the disadvantages of the other distributions but I find that immoral and again I wouldn't convince anyone.Of course at some point I'll have to make some comparison with other distributions but that will only serve my intention to define the position where openSUSE stands and under no circumstances I have no intention to undermine any distribution because that would undermined the work of other people like me who make a try to support FOSS and FOSS is above all.

"In August we delivered the news that Linux was soon to receive [a native ZFS Linux kernel module](http://www.phoronix.com/vr.php?view=15232). The Sun (now Oracle) ZFS file-system has long been sought after for Linux, though less now since [Btrfs](http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=search&q=Btrfs) has emerged, but incompatibilities between the CDDL and GPL licenses have barred such support from entering the mainline Linux kernel. There has been ZFS-FUSE to run the ZFS file-system in user-space, but it [comes with slow performance](http://www.phoronix.com/vr.php?view=15235). There has also been work by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in [porting ZFS to Linux](http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=ODU1MA) as a native Linux kernel module. This LLNL ZFS work though is incomplete but still progressing due to a US Department of Energy contract. It is though via this work that developers in India at KQ Infotech have made working a Linux kernel module for ZFS.
