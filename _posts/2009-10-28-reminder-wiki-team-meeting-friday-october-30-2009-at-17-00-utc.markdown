The openSUSE Wiki Team Meeting will take place on Friday, the 30th of October 2009 at 17.00 UTC. See all time zones on the [Fixed Time World Clock](//tinyurl.com/yhvmycg). The meeting will be held in IRC on the #opensuse-wiki channel on Freenode.

We'll discuss the new usability concept for the openSUSE wiki. Everyone interested is welcome to join us. The agenda (working draft) is available [here](//lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-wiki/2009-10/msg00100.html).

Not familiar with IRC? A good overview can be found at [irchelp.org](//www.irchelp.org/). This site is not affiliated with openSUSE.
