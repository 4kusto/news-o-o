The openSUSE Wiki Team Meeting will take place on Friday, the 30th of October 2009 at 17.00 UTC. See all time zones on the [Fixed Time World Clock](http://tinyurl.com/yhvmycg). The meeting will be held in IRC on the #opensuse-wiki channel on Freenode.

We'll discuss the new usability concept for the openSUSE wiki. Everyone interested is welcome to join us. The agenda (working draft) is available [here](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-wiki/2009-10/msg00100.html).
