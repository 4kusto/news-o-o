## Be there!




This year oSC12 will take place at the [Czech Technical University](http://www.cvut.cz/en) in Prague. The campus is located in the district Dejvice and is next to an underground station that gets you directly to the historic city center - an opportunity you can't miss!





We expect to welcome about 500 Open Source developers, testers, usability experts, artists and professional attendees to the openSUSE conference, but we won't be alone: this year, we work together with the local LinuxDays, SUSE Labs and the Gentoo community, making one big, smashing event!

The entire combined conference is expected to attract well over 1500 people. Admission to the openSUSE conference as well as LinuxDays, the SUSE Labs conference and the Gentoo miniconf is completely free. However for oSC a professional attendee ticket is available that offers some additional benefits.





The conference will start at October 20 and end on the 23th. Be there!
