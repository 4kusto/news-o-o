Dear openSUSE Community. Users. Contributors. Fans and friends. The time has come: **openSUSE 11.4 has arrived!**. After 8 months of hard work, you can **learn what is new**, **download it** **and** **upgrade**!

We are proud to announce the launch of 11.4 in  the openSUSE tradition of delivering the latest technology while  maintaining stability. The 11.4 release brings significant improvements along with the latest in Free Software  applications. Combined  with the appearance of new tools, projects and services around the release, 11.4 marks a  showcase of growth and vitality for the openSUSE Project! Read on for more details about this release...

## <!-- more -->Base System


openSUSE always concentrates on a stable foundation that is usable for different workloads. The base system of 11.4 brings better  scalability and performance, an enhanced boot processes and significantly faster repository refresh, package install and update.

[gallery link="file" include="7591,7592,7593"]

11.4 is based around [Kernel](//www.kernel.org) 2.6.37 which improves the scalability of virtual memory management and  separation of tasks executed by terminal users, leading to **better  scalability and performance** and less interference between tasks. The new kernel also brings better hardware support,  with open [Broadcom Wireless](//www.broadcom.com/products/?industry_id=2) drivers, improved [Wacom](//www.wacom.com) support and many other new  or updated drivers. It also supports the improvements to graphic drivers in the latest [Xorg](//www.x.org/) and [Mesa](//www.mesa3d.org/) shipped, so users will enjoy better 2D and 3D acceleration.

New tools for an **enhanced boot process**. The latest [gfxboot](//en.opensuse.org/SDB:Gfxboot) 4.3.5 supports [VirtualBox](//www.virtualbox.org/) and [qemu-kvm](//www.linux-kvm.org/) while Vixie Cron has been replaced with [Cronie](https://fedorahosted.org/cronie/) 1.4.6 supporting the [PAM](//www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/) and the [SELinux](//www.nsa.gov/research/selinux/) security frameworks. The more experimental software options include [GRUB2](//www.gnu.org/software/grub/) and [systemd](//www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd).

The [ZYpp](//en.opensuse.org/Portal:Libzypp) package management introduces a MultiCurl backend, support for [zsync](//zsync.moria.org.uk/) transfers, and [Metalink](//www.metalinker.org/) download support. With simultaneous downloads from multiple servers, and fetching of only changed parts of files, the result is a **significantly faster repository refresh, package install and update**. The new backend gives better support for network proxies and allows for HTTP BASIC password-protected repositories.  On the desktop, [KPackageKit](//www.packagekit.org/) replaces the KDE applet and both [KDE](//www.kde.org/) and  [GNOME](//www.gnome.org/) applets now default to installing all package updates, not just patches.


## Desktops and Applications


openSUSE  is committed to flexibility and choice, providing all major desktops and a full range of applications, well integrated and  supported. The desktops and applications of 11.4 take the next step with a revamped user experience, all the popular up to date Free Software applications and consistent functionality even in lighter desktops.

[gallery link="file" include="7597,7596,7600"]

The [KDE Plasma Desktop](//www.kde.org/workspaces/plasmadesktop/) 4.6  introduces script-ability to window manager KWin and easier Activity  management as well as improvements to network and bluetooth handling.  Stable [GNOME 2.32](//library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.32/) improves usability and accessibility. 11.4  also has [GNOME Shell](//live.gnome.org/GnomeShell), part of the upcoming [GNOME3](//www.gnome3.org/), available for  testing. This brings a fully **revamped user experience** with a visual and  intuitive way of launching and switching between applications, making  heavy use of 3D acceleration, window tiling, integrating  notifications and messaging in the shell. [Xfce](//www.xfce.org/) 4.8  now makes use of the GIO VFS implementation for better remote  file system browsing as well as [udev](//www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev.html), [ConsoleKit](//www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/ConsoleKit) and [PolicyKit](//www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PolicyKit). The  lighter weight [LXDE](//lxde.org/) 0.5  hasn’t seen any major changes with this release but continues to  enhance stability and usability with a series of bugfixes, improved file  association and theming.

[Firefox](//www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/) 4.0, first to ship in 11.4, introduces a major redesign of  the user interface with tabs moved to the top of the toolbar, support for pinning of tabs and more. [Firefox Sync](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox_Sync) synchronizes bookmarks, history, passwords and tabs between  all your installations. Firefox 4 also supports newer web standards like HTML5, WebM and CSS3. 11.4 includes even more of the **popular up to date Free Software applications** as it's the first major distribution to ship [LibreOffice](//www.libreoffice.org/) 3.3.1. Delivering it's cleaner, faster code base and features like import and edit SVG files in Draw, support for up to 1 million rows in Calc and easier slide layout handling in Impress. 11.4 also débuts the result of almost 4 years of work with the [Scribus](//www.scribus.net/) 1.4  release based on Qt 4 and Cairo technology. Improved text rendering,  undo-redo, image/color management and vector file import are  highlights of this release.

openSUSE offers deep integration  of all these technologies. By carefully creating ‘patterns’ of  software, openSUSE ensures **consistent functionality even in lighter  desktops** like XFCE and LXDE. Keyboard shortcuts are set, menu layouts tweaked, user-friendly file associations  chosen and branding and theming integrated. 11.4 furthermore  improves on the LibreOffice and Firefox integration in KDE Plasma, using  native file dialogs, oxygen styling (also for GTK applications) and respecting the user’s mail client and browser choices.


## Professional tools for administrators and developers


openSUSE  aims to be the perfect power tool for system administrators to keep  their network safe and their systems under control. And as developing and maintaining free software is the bread and butter task of the openSUSE Project the distribution naturally brings everything a software developer needs. 11.4 ships the latest virtualization and web server stacks and all the major development languages, platforms and associated IDEs.

[gallery link="file" include="7603,7604,7605"]

11.4 brings **the latest virtualization stack** with [Xen](//www.xen.org/) 4.0.2 introducing  memory overcommit and a VMware Workstation/player driver, [VirtualBox](//www.virtualbox.org/) 4.0.4 supporting VMDK, VHD, and Parallels images, as well as resizing  for VHD and VDI and [KVM](//www.linux-kvm.org/) 0.14 with support for the QEMU Enhanced Disk format and the SPICE protocol. As guest, 11.4 includes open-vm-tools and virtualbox-guest-tools, and seamlessly integrates clipboard sharing, screen resizing and un-trapping your mouse.

openSUSE ships with **the latest web server stack** featuring [Apache](//www.apache.org/) 2.2.17, [lighttpd](//www.lighttpd.net/) 1.4.26 and [ngninx](//nginx.net/) 0.8.54. As well as the main databases like version 9.0.3 of [PostgreSQL](//www.postgresql.org/), a release that  brings major features like easy-to-use replication, a mass  permission-changing facility, and anonymous code blocks. And [MySQL](//www.mysql.com/) 5.1.53  (community edition), and its fork [MariaDB](//mariadb.org/) 5.1 that offers a drop-in  replacement with better performance and some extra features are  complemented while SQLite features a new transaction control mechanism using a write-ahead log.

openSUSE 11.4 comes with **all the major development languages, platforms and associated IDEs**. [Qt](//qt.nokia.com/) 4.7.1 and [QtCreator](//qt.nokia.com/products/developer-tools/) 2.1 bring a better and faster WebKit and support for the QML Declarative language, also supported in the KDE Development Platform 4.6 which in turn introduces a ‘Mobile Build Target’ for a thinner version of its libraries. The GNOME 2.32 platform brings [Vala](//live.gnome.org/Vala) and [Python](//www.python.org/) support to [Anjuta](//www.anjuta.org/) and Glib 2.26 supports Gsettings. 11.4 ships with [GTK+](//www.gtk.org/) 3 bringing  improved device input handling, fully [Cairo](//library.gnome.org/devel/cairo/) based drawing (with  multiple backends) and much easier theming to developers who want to  develop for the upcoming GNOME 3 release. For developers who are  interested in working on LibreOffice, openSUSE offers the unique advantage of using a ‘split build’, making it easy to get involved.


## Around 11.4


Additionally to the distribution the  openSUSE project also provides a variety of tools, projects and services to its fellow Free and Open Source community members and its users. Supporting 11.4 are [Tumbleweed](//en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed), a rolling release repository, the [Build Service](//build.opensuse.org) to easily create and release open source  software and 11.4 inside [susestudio](//susestudio.com) for you to experiment with.

[gallery link="file" include="7610,7609,7608"]

For this release we are particularly  pleased to introduce **Tumbleweed**,** a rolling release repository** containing the latest stable versions of projects instead of relying on a  rigid, periodic release cycle. The project does this for users that want  the newest, but stable software. Additionally the popular third-party package provider Packman  has reorganized and optimized its repositories for the openSUSE 11.4  release. The [Packman](//packman.links2linux.org) team, which provides a large number of new and  updated packages for openSUSE, simultaneously introduces support for  Tumbleweed.

The Free and Open Source software developers are greatly aided in the distribution of their software by the innovative  technologies  developed or initiated by the openSUSE Project. Like the newly released Build Service 2.1.6 which provides the infrastructure to **easily create and release open source  software** for openSUSE, Fedora, Debian and many other Linux distributions and projects like [Bretzn](//socialdesktop.org/bretzn/) or [Appstream](//distributions.freedesktop.org/wiki/AppStream) which  support developers in building and distributing their applications and users in getting it.

We are also happy to also announce that Novell’s SUSE Studio,  building upon openSUSE technology like KIWI, offers 11.4 as a  base to build appliances upon from its convenient webinterface. We  invite anyone to **visit [susestudio.com](//susestudio.com/) to experiment with 11.4**, to create custom versions as Live CD, USB or VM images and to share them on [susegallery.com](//www.susegallery.com)!
