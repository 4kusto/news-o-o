[![LinuxFest Northwest Totem logo](/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/totem350.png)](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/04/25/opensuse-coming-to-lfnw/totem350-2/)Following in the growing list of appearances we're making worldwide, openSUSE will land in Bellingham, Washington for the LinuxFest Northwest conference ( [LFNW](http://lfnw.org) ) on Saturday, April 30 and Sunday, May 1 at the [Bellingham Technical College](http://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org/information/venue).  We're excited to be joining in the festivities there, along with an exxpected attendance of over 1,000 visitors, running a booth and 3 presentations,Â doing our best to help make the event interesting and successful for everyone.<!-- more -->

Doing what we do best, you'll find the same great booth you've come to expect at other events.  There, you'll be able to pick up a DVD of [openSUSE 11.4](http://software.opensuse.org/114/en), just released last month amid great reviews.  You'll also be able to show your support for openSUSE and LFNW at the same time by buying an openSUSE [T-shirt](http://en.opensuse.org/File:Black_t-shirt.jpg) for just $5.  Every dollar we make will go directly to supporting the great work of the LFNW crew.  These FOSS events are very important to the community and openSUSE wants to do its part to promote that.

For those of you that prefer a game of chance, be sure to sign up for the "World-Famous" LFNW [raffle](http://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org/sessions/world-famous-raffle); we've donated a few bigger-ticket items there as well, and again, all funds support LFNW.


### On the spot Engineering!


We're going to make an engineer out of you yet.  Visit our booth and you can create your very own Linux distro powered by openSUSE with the [SUSE Studio](http://susestudio.com) Kiosk.  Yes, right on the spot!  Folks will be on hand to guide you through the incredibly easy steps it takes to roll your own OS.

While you're tinkering around, we'll make an engineer out of your kids too.  We'll keep them busy in our origami corner teaching how to create our beloved Geeko and penguins out of paper. It's a fun way to teach the fundamentals of open source to kids of all ages.


### We'll talk too!


Not only will you be able to learn about the many things going on in openSUSE at our booth, we're also conducting a few sessions:



	
  * **openSUSE - It's not just a distro!**
openSUSE Board members Alan Clark and Bryen Yunashko give an overview of just what makes openSUSE Project more than just a distro.

	
  * **Linux your way with SUSE Studio**
SUSE Studio Developer extraordinaire and local Bellinghamster, James Mason introduces the audience to the many benefits of creating your own custom distro with SUSE Studio.

	
  * **Write and Submit your First Linux Kernel Patch**
Our very own Kernel Guru Greg KH educates the audience on how they can become a kernel developer too.




### Watch us live!


Even if you can't make it to LFNW, you can still join in the festivities.Â  Some of our sessions are scheduled to be broadcast live on [Jupiter Broadcasting](http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/).Â  Sit back from the comfort of your own home, put up your feet and fire up your browser.


### So Join us!


If you're in the area and would like to join us in the booth or to just stop by to get to know us, drop us a line. Spearheaded by James Mason, you can already see he's got some impressive stuff lined up for us at LFNW.  We're looking forward to seeing many openSUSE users in the area and getting to know you all.
