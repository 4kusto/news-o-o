[openSUSE-repos](https://github.com/openSUSE/openSUSE-repos) simplifies openSUSE repository management by utilizing [zypp-services](https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/libzypp/HEAD/zypp-services.html#services-usecase-4).
The latest version switches users to the new [cdn.opensuse.org](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/4YOJ2MMSET5JN42T2H2GAHQG5MG5YGBT/) for all "default" distribution repositories.


The nice part is that existing users of [openSUSE-repos](https://github.com/openSUSE/openSUSE-repos) will be switched automatically to CDN on the next `zypper refresh` after the openSUSE-repos update.

### Installation of openSUSE-repos for your distribution

[openSUSE-repos](https://github.com/openSUSE/openSUSE-repos) backs up and disable all default system repositories as long as they have original filenames.
User-defined repositories will remain untouched.


`sudo zypper in openSUSE-repos-Leap` 

`sudo zypper in openSUSE-repos-Tumbleweed`

`sudo zypper in openSUSE-repos-MicroOS`

`sudo zypper in openSUSE-repos-LeapMicro`
  

Install the correct package for your distribution and you should be all set.
All repositories generated by zypp-services can be easily identified by the "openSUSE:" prefix.

```lkocman@localhost> zypper lr -u | grep "openSUSE:"```<br>
``` 8 | openSUSE:repo-oss                      | repo-oss (15.5)               | Yes     | (r ) Yes  | Yes     | https://cdn.opensuse.org/distribution/leap/15.5/repo/oss```<br>
```...```

### Contributions

More information about zypp-services can be found in [doc-o-o](https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/libzypp/HEAD/zypp-services.html).

### Rollback

[openSUSE-repos](https://github.com/openSUSE/openSUSE-repos). Does not touch any non-default repositories at all.
backs up all the default distribution repository definitions as part of the installation as long as they keep original filenames.
Users can simply restore old repository files by following instructions in the project [README](https://github.com/openSUSE/openSUSE-repos#restoring-original-distribution-repositories) file.
