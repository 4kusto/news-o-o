**Abstract**

We are pleased to announce our 154 issue of the openSUSE Weekly News. 
      This week was very interesting. The Novell "The Disters" Contest was finished, and the Winners are announced. Then we have a new Board Member (driven by Novell) as Replacement for Michael Loeffler. Then new candidates comes up for the Board Election. So you see, we had a lot to read. Enjoy the reading :-)

      [Holiday Wishes from the openSUSE Board](http://news.opensuse.org/2010/12/13/holiday-wishes-from-the-opensuse-board/)
    **
> 
> Seasons Greetings to everyone in the openSUSE Community and beyond from the openSUSE
      Board! 
> 
> As we come to the end of 2010, we’d like to take a moment to reflect on a banner year in
      the Project. We’ve had some very good progress this year and 2011 promises to be an even
      greater year. This year, we hosted our second annual openSUSE Conference in Nuremberg, Germany
      with over 70 presentations and many BoF discussions. Attendance grew from the first year. 
> 
> Also, this year, the Board rolled up its sleeves and opened up a discussion with the
      Community about the strategic direction of openSUSE. A finalized strategic statement is
      imminent. The creation of an openSUSE Foundation is well underway. We’re currently reviewing
      legal documents related to the creation and are very excited about this. The Foundation will
      be a step forward in further empowering our Community. More and more people are stepping up to
      champion openSUSE’s role in the open source world. We saw ambassador growth in countries like
      Brasil and Greece, and stengthened in other places like India, Europe and the United States.
      We’re seeing more people available to show up at conferences and events to present and
      demonstrate openSUSE. 
> 
> In addition to releasing openSUSE 11.3, the openSUSE Build Service also reached a critical
      milestone earlier this year with the release of 2.0. A gem of our Project, the Build Service
      aims to not only make package management easier for our own distro but to also make it easier
      with other distros. Truly an open project. Community days abounded all over the place
      throughout the year from Collaboration days to bug/hacking days as teams set aside time to
      complete tasks and move forward with their plans. The openSUSE Board will be holding its final
      meeting of 2010 this Wednesday at 19:00 UTC in the #opensuse-project IRC channel on Freenode.
      We invite you all to attend, as all of our meetings our public and we do appreciate the many
      contributions our Community offers during our meetings, particularly during the “Where can we
      improve?” session we implemented earlier this year. Incidentally, it is election season again
      for the openSUSE Board and we’re excited to see so many candidates. If you’ve been thinking
      about running for one of the two seats, we encourage you to apply for candidacy ASAP! 
> 
> To be sure, serving on the Board is a rewarding experience, and also requires commitment
      and dedication. 2011 is going to be a turning point year for the Project. With the creation of
      the Foundation and implementation of the openSUSE Strategy, there is no doubt that many new
      initiatives from the Community will come forth and the Board will play an important role in
      guiding and shaping the future of openSUSE as a Project. 
> 
> So, as we close here, we’d like to wish each and every one of you a safe and joyous
      holiday season with friends and loved ones. You can be sure that as we Board members toast in
      the New Year from various corners of the world, we’ll be thinking of you all and rejoicing
      being part of a strong, dedicated and passionate community. 
> 
> See you all at Wednesday’s meeting, and in 2011!

> As you know, Michael Loeffler has left the openSUSE Board to pursue new opportunities, we
      are sad to see him go and wish him well. With his departure and with the upcoming Board
      elections, we have a desire to see a new Chairperson selected. The election rules state that
      the Chairperson be appointed by Novell and yesterday Markus Rex, General Manager of Novells
      Open Platform Solutions, presented Alan Clark to us as the new Chairperson. 
> 
> As you may be aware, we have focused a significant amount of our time on the creation of
      an openSUSE Foundation to be independent and to be able to collect and spread funds. And
      Novell has been very supportive with our desire to see this come to fruition. Markus told us
      that one of the reasons he selected Alan is that he has a lot of expertise in setting up
      foundations. Alan helped to form the Open Source Development Labs (OSDL) and the Linux
      Foundation, as well as several other open source projects and organisations. We, along with
      Markus, believe that Alan’s experience and expertise will be an asset of immense value to the
      Board, and we welcome that as we, and Novell, partner together in forging ahead on an exciting
      and promising future for the openSUSE Project. 
> 
> Alan has already been working with us on the foundation work, but most of you probably
      don’t know him, so we asked Alan to introduce himself: 
> 
> Having the opportunity to work closely with the openSUSE community is an exciting
      endeavour. My work assignments over the past few years have enabled me to work directly with
      members of the community. By attending the recent openSUSE conference I was able to make many
      more friends and acquaintances. As always it was a great experience. One of my personal goals
      from this role will be to get to know and to work with as many members of the community as
      possible. 
> 
> A bit about me: Though my engineering roles have varied throughout the years, I am a
      software developer at heart. I began my career writing Unix based network protocols. Anybody
      remember LAT? My past projects have helped me develop a broad technical base across the
      spectrum of software development, from device drivers, to file systems, to network protocols,
      to identity and security, to developer SDKs and across multiple operating systems. I remember
      that the first day I was able to do my work on Linux was a great day. 
> 
> I am extremely optimistic for the future of openSUSE, the potential growth of the
      community, delivery of the openSUSE strategy and the advancement of Linux in general. Our
      community has a great future! My goal is to help facilitate the many ambitions of the openSUSE
      community members and advance the openSUSE Guiding Principles.
> 
> Please join us in welcoming Alan to his new role! Alan will begin his position at the next
      openSUSE Board meeting tomorrow at 19:00 UTC in the #opensuse-project channel on the Freenode
      network. All of our meetings are open to the public and we welcome you to our meeting to meet
      Alan.

> 
> Hi, we will do an openFATE screening day next monday.
> 
> What does this mean?
> 
> With the renewed  [openFATE feature trackingsystem ](https://features.opensuse.org/ )we have the possibility
      to involve the community in all steps of feature evaluation and implementation.
      Everyone can take responsibility for features now and track their state in
      openFATE.
      We already have some [subprojects](https://features.opensuse.org/statistic) using openfate such as the openSUSE
      distribution,
      OBS, SUSE Studio, Infrastructure ...
> 
> On monday we will focus on screening the 11.4 features, getting used to
      the [process](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Openfate_process) and report problems with the feature tracking tool.

<blockquote>**[Next Tuesday: Social Media Collaboration Day](http://news.opensuse.org/2010/12/17/next-tuesday-social-media-collaboration-day/)**
> 
> Last Monday the second Marketing Collaboration Day happened – with a focus on Marketing Materials. The moderators, Chuck Payne and Bryen Yunashko, would like 
      to thank everyone who got involved for their hard work! It was a successful day with many items covered, added and expanded for openSUSE Marketing.
> 
> Among other things, some how-to’s were updated like [how to organize a Launch Party](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Launch_party_HOWTO) (yes, openSUSE 11.4 is coming!) Moreover two short presentations on SUSE Studio 
        and OBS were created which can be used in presentations from the Ambassadors. Already some Greek ambassadors are using them and they promised to contribute back translated 
        versions. Besides the wiki and the presentations, volunteers took on the task of developing success case stories involving openSUSE, creating models for Letters 
        of Sponsorship requests, and how to collaborate and work with educational institutions.  Obviously a broad range of topics and opportunities to promote openSUSE.
> 
> But the team isn’t done yet. Like in the previous Collaboration Day, which focused on our Ambassador Program, several items have been picked up to be finished 
      later. Thanks for that!
> 
> There is a renewed energy in our team as we collectively begin to have a broader bird’s-eye view of the state of our marketing resources and build up enthusiasm 
      and motivation amongst our team members.
> 
> Meanwhile, next week a new Collaboration Day will happen, this time on Tuesday December 21. This, because one of it’s principle organizers, Manu Gupta, will 
      return from his hard work at FOSS.in on Monday. The other organizer is Jos Poortvliet and the topic of this Collaboration day will be Social Media.
> 
> The goal is to work on our press and media channels and our communication on the web. Writing short project descriptions, gathering features for our 11.4 
        announcement, creating a Prezi presentation about openSUSE, gathering screenshots and creating themes for Identica/twitter/blogger and other outlets are 
        all on the agenda.
> 
> And of course the plumbing: making sure all accounts are connected properly so an announcement or news.o.o article goes to all the proper channels automatically, 
        making sure the account details are in the hands of several different people and much more. All in all it promises to be a great Collaboration day, so if you’re interested 
        in Social Media and doing some work, join us and help out!
> 
> The meeting will be held in the [#openSUSE-Marketing](irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-marketing) IRC channel on Freenode. Collaboration Days 
        begin at 9:00 UTC and end at 24:00 UTC

## Board Election 2010

<blockquote>**[Nelson Marques: Board elections…](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/12/14/board-elections/)**
> 
> I’ve decided to remain a spectator during this Board elections to understand the process
      and I like the applies for the board. I can say I’m happy to see ‘mrdocs’ applying for the
      board, as he was one of the persons which helped me a lot with openSUSE Build Service in my
      early days. He always had a cool advice or a couple of minutes to make my life easier. 
> 
> Except for ‘mrdocs’ I really don’t know much about the other candidates, so I’ve decided
      to take a small note and expose my frustration for not seeing Sirko Kemter running for the
      Board. I would support Sirko on running to the board for several reasons: 
> 
> 
      
> 
>   1. He’s the face of openSUSE Artwork team. He’s been doing awesome screencasts and
            tutorials… I guess in a way, related to Artwork, which I find to be an area which is
            underdeveloped in openSUSE, he can bring lots of new synergies… and a new visual
            identity to openSUSE. 
> 
>   2. His degree of commitment to the local German Community. I’ve seen some posts of him
            and some of the initiatives he does. I loved the openMovie night at KommKino in Nürnberg
            during openSUSE Conference for which he was the mastermind behind it. So he’s really a
            community guy. 
> 
>   3. His a vertical and direct person, which speaks his mind. This is something I love
            on people. I don’t know Sirko from talking on the back of people, I know him from being
            straight to point and direct. This is a very positive thing… 
> 
>   4. Gnokii plays well the role of ‘bad cop’. That’s always good to have around.
            Sometimes people need to ear more harsh things to get back into reality. Gnokii does
            this role good. 
> 
>   5. He’s one of the most objective people I’ve seen around… many times bringing people
            to reality, thus speeding up people on taking actions and drop the philosophical
            issues
> 
> 
    
> 
> I really see him as a community guy, always around, helping whenever he cans… He’s doing a
      great job and he should be empowered to run to the Board. 
> 
> For all the other candidates, which many I don’t know… good luck… with so much cool people
      running for the Board, I can only see a smiling future ahead. I won’t vote for the Board
      elections for some reasons, being the major… I won’t to split votes amongst so many cool
      people, therefore, I’m remaining on neutral grounds wishing all the best of luck. Whatever is
      the outcome, I’m sure openSUSE will win! 
> 
> Have a lot of fun! 
> 
> PS: I hope to see a public debate with all candidates on IRC opened to questions and
      doubts from the openSUSE community members and users! Please make it happen!

> I had a side project the last two weeks: Make the build service more fun to use. 
> 
> No matter how much fun you have creating packages, if they don’t build, there is
          little point in using a Service that has Build in its name, no? So one of the major goals
          of the service is actually to help those that want to build packages as good as possible.
          But there is a problem:

          107,691 packages, in 26,259 repositories and is used by 25,967 confirmed users.”. That are
          quite some high numbers – especially in the relation to the ~25 servers we have for
          actually building.

          because further patching is required at least in GTK and eventually on glib. I don’t think
          there’s actually any need to have this indicator, specially when it will bring additional
          efforts on GTK maintenance, and this feature is somehow supported by software like
          gnome-globalmenu (which I’ve also packaged for myself and works dearly with supported

          support libraries that are required as dependencies forwarded to projects where they might

> The Team had a meeting on Monday, December 6, when we talked about our
           experiences with openSUSE 11.4 M4. The automated installation testing seems to
           be working as no one reported installation failures. Our major complaints were
           Bug #657605 (corrupted downloads), Bug #656060 (poor performance for i945
           graphics hardware), and k3b crashing. The corrupted download bug is fixed in M5,
           and k3b now works. I am aware of other problems with the i915 driver in the
           2.6.37 kernel, but those are being addresses in the upstream kernel.

        was a php based CMS and was made without using any of the existing frameworks. You can find

> At the openSUSE conference almost two months ago a special Educational track on Saturday
        featured talks about the progress on openSUSE Edu-L.i.f.e, the applications it ships and
        many other educational topics. The goal of the openSUSE Edu team is to cater for students,
        educators as well as parents and the software they develop, package and ship has everything
        required to make computers productive for either home or school usage. 
> 
> At the conference over 30 people discussed topics including X2go and thin client
        computing in general, several openSUSE based educational distributions, opsi, a Client
        Management System for Windows clients based on Linux servers, groupware (including
        openXchange), PyKota printing accounting software, the KIOSK tool and more.
> 
> **X2go** is based on FreeNX, a remote display server
        technology providing very good application responsiveness over high latency, low bandwidth
        links like the Internet. X2go upstream developer Heinz M. Graesing gave a talk about
        Skolelinux and also gave some insights of his work on X2go. He attended also other sessions,
        including one by openSUSE’s Michael Kromer about X2go installation, configuration and best
        practices on openSUSE and SLES. openSUSE is very close to upstream X2go and Heinz came away
        impressed, asking for the code behind one of the demoed features!
> 
> **Several demonstrations** and talks about linux in schools
        were given. Besides Skolelinux and Arktur, the Extis GmbH (who also sponsored the Education
        Flyers sent to the schools in the town and some speakers) showed a business school server
        (based on SLES11-SP1). And the Desktop4Education project from Austria showed a desktop and
        server solution based on openSUSE. The talk from Helmut Hullen, working on Arktur, the
        oldest Linux school server project (since 1992!) in Germany, shows the enthusiasm of users
        and developers behind such projects. Arktur is a Slackware based system with a huge
        community of users. Unfortunately the team developing it has been shrinking and is now down
        to mostly one person, but they work together with Heise, a German magazine, to distribute
        copies and information about Arktur. (..)

      Due to the heavy patches from Google to ffmpeg, it does not work just to build chromium

        digital audio have a lot of formats to choose from, so do eBooks. Annoyingly, they not only
        offer many formats, but also several DRM schemes too. 
> 
> One of the problems with eBooks, or some eBooks, is Digital Restriction Management
        (DRM). Yes, the industry likes to call it Digital Right's Management, but that's really not
        what's going on. When you buy books from Amazon, Barnes and Noble, Apple, etc.the books are
        encrypted with DRM so that you can't open them on multiple devices or competing devices —
        even if they support the same format. For example, ePub is a widely supported format that
        can be read by a number of eBook devices like Barnes and Noble's Nook and iBooks on iOS. If
        you have an ePub book without DRM, you can read it anywhere. 
> 
> But ePub supports an optional DRM scheme, so publishers can add DRM to it and restrict
        it to one player or one type of DRM format. I don't find it upsetting that publishers are
        trying to find a way to limit sharing of eBooks, but the side effect is that users really
        lack options when it comes to acquiring books. If you want access to new books, you're stuck
        choosing one of the major vendors (Amazon, Apple, Barnes and Noble, etc.) and then as you
        acquire more material, you get locked into those vendors and their readers.

> 
> During the OSC2010 in Nürnberg I tried without much success to pass on the word that
      Marketing isn’t about a Team, but comes also down to us. This in an awesome time to
      demonstrate that on practice… Right now with an important release on the horizon, your
      Marketing team is starting a process to gather information to promote the features of the next
      release. Speaking for myself, I don’t feel confortable in taking an assingment of gathering
      features for example about the Kernel. As I won’t feel confortable producing contents about
      KDE which I barelly know… Nevertheless if those contents aren’t provided to us…. we have to
      dig for them… sometimes not even having a clue of the extention of their importance. 
> 
> Many times I’ve heard the ultimate excuse ‘Marketing is for Ubuntu, because they are just
      Marketing and nothing else’… and things on that line… Well… think again… who’s fault is this
      that only them care about Marketing ? I see a good opportunity for you all to achieve some
      things in the next days… with only 10 minutes of your time… and why could be nice it happened
      this way:
> 
>   * You run a project that is on Factory… cool… Please take 10 minutes, make a small
            list of 10 features that are really cool on the next release… make a 7/15 lines text on
            how your project changed and the benefit of the improvements for our users (if you don’t
            know your users, then write it as if you were talking about yourself)… This way you save
            your Marketing Team ‘wild goose chase’ on a stack of Changelogs we might not understand…
            even worst, we might even pass on the wrong stuff….
> 
>   * By doing this… you are doing Marketing… you are promoting your own project within
            openSUSE, giving it more visibility and with 10 mins of your time… you will pass on the
            right word to the Marketing Team and help them. Instead of spending 50 hours searching
            for stuff and taking some hard decisions that might not work out in the best way for
            YOUR project, we have 50 mins more to work your information and make sure it is better
            used for the interests of YOUR project.
> 
>   * If Marketing takes 3 features to write an article or make Marketing materials… and
            just lists the other 7… If like at least we get contributions in this form from: Kernel,
            GNOME, KDE and Ambassadors (yes, people should also be on the release)… thats 3×4 = 12
            featured articles for the release and a feature list of 40 new exciting
            features….
> 
> Now… does this seem so surreal to ask 10 minutes of your time to help out your
      Marketing Team and make the best release ever! Oh! And have a lot of fun! 
> 
> Someone said that I was crazy… and that projects and developers would never comply and
      would most likely laugh on my face after proposing such thing… I might be crazy… or I might
      very well on the wrong track. I’ve decided not to back down from facing the ‘mob’, and still
      risking to be laughed upon, I brought this to your attention.

### Announcements

<blockquote>**[Attachmate/Open Letter to Novell Customers](http://www.attachmate.com/Press/PressReleases/openletter.html)**
> 
> Since the announcement of our intent to acquire Novell, we have received a number of
        questions regarding our plans for supporting Novell products. I know that during this period
        between the announcement and closing, there are more questions than answers, and I am
        sensitive to the challenges that this uncertainty may create for Novell customers and
        partners. I want to take this opportunity to be clear about the commitments we make to all
        of our customers. 
> 
> Attachmate is committed to delivering quality products, providing exceptional customer
        service, and being easy to do business with. We are excited about the opportunity to make
        these same commitments to Novell customers after closing. To ensure that we do so,
        Attachmate will support the existing roadmaps and release schedules for products across the
        Novell and SUSE portfolios. 
> 
> It is also important for our existing and future customers to know that we have a proven
        history of supporting our solutions throughout their product lifecycles. Our philosophy is
        to create options for customers to move forward, not force them to abandon products that
        have become critical to their operation and success. We will continue to invest in both the
        innovation of next-generation products and the nurturing of more mature and widely adopted
        solutions. We understand that our customers’ success depends on having the flexibility to
        evolve and adopt new technologies at their own pace and cadence. We intend to support that
        need. 
> 
> As we look forward to 2011 and beyond, our excitement continues to grow about the
        potential addition of Novell and SUSE to our portfolio and the opportunity that they create
        to deliver increasing value to our combined customer base. I look forward to sharing more
        details and specifics about those plans once the transaction has closed.

> 
> The VAR Guy did some digging and found an SEC filing that more fully describes Novell’s
        pending sale to Attachmate. The filing describes how J.P. Morgan, working on Novell’s
        behalf, shopped Novell around to multiple bidders, and Novell mulled potential deals
        involving Microsoft and other unnamed companies. Novell even considered running SUSE Linux
        as a standalone business. Here’s the story only The VAR Guy took the time to pursue. 
> 
> Overall, Novell representatives contacted 52 potential buyers. Roughly nine official
        bidders emerged. So how did Attachmate wind up buying the bulk of Novell’s assets? And what
        happened to rumored SUSE Linux bids from VMware? In a preliminary [proxy statement](http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/758004/000119312510279941/0001193125-10-279941-index.htm) dated December 14, Novell offers an extensive time line
        describing how the company’s board of directors, executive team, and external financial
        advisors pursued potential buyers for the company. The filing is more than 100 pages. Here
        are some of the highlights, paraphrased by The VAR Guy. Please note:
> 
>   * The vast majority of the info below is based on information within Novell’s SEC
              filing.
> 
>   * Novell protects the names of several bidders, referring to them as Party A through
              Party E. In some cases, The VAR Guy makes some educated guesses about the actual
              identity of each company. But The VAR Guy’s educated guesses could be wrong.
