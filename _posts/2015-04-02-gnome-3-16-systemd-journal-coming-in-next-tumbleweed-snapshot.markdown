It’s official, Gnome will be in the next Tumbleweed snapshot and the development experience is highly anticipated. A clean installation works, but the guys are working on one last test before its released. We’re not promising an early Easter gift, but Tumbleweed users won’t have to wait long for Gnome’s latest upgrade.

A small change to Linux can be seen in Tumbleweed with a change from the syslog to systemd-journal; the systemd-journal as a binary file needs special tools to look at it. The topic was discussed on how to provides the ability to import structured log messages from systemd journal to syslog and you can read more about this discussion at [http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2015-04/](http://bit.ly/1EJ5vJW).

App Armor service is causing a longer delay on startup, but the solution is on the mailing list link above.


FireFox 37 should make it into an upcoming snapshot and this Mozilla update is considered its most revolutionary release; HTML5 playback on YouTube, a new rating system called Heartbeat and other implementations have the media buzzing about this latest release.
Another topic that is buzzing is KDE’s transition from KDE4 to Plasma 5 at the default Desktop Environment. On the mailing list at [http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2015-04/msg00002.html](http://bit.ly/1IqsmHY), the end of April appears to be a point where KDE will remove  KDE4 from repository and transition to its latest and greatest Desktop Environment.
