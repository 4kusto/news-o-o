We had a successful [openSUSE 11.3](http://news.opensuse.org/2010/07/15/opensuse-11-3-is-here/) launch yesterday. The announcement itself saw many friendly comments. Many people retweeted the announcement from @openSUSE.

Besides the announcement on [news.opensuse.org](http://news.opensuse.org/2010/07/15/opensuse-11-3-is-here/), Novell released a [press release](http://www.novell.com/news/press/opensuse-project-releases-opensuse-11.3/) and distributed it through the press channel. We're collecting all press mentions of the launch in the [openSUSE wiki](http://en.opensuse.org/In_the_press).

A couple of launch parties were held and more parties are upcoming, reports from them will show up on [Planet openSUSE](http://planet.opensuse.org) soon.Â  So far I've seen a report about the launch in [Bucharest](http://nicubunu.blogspot.com/2010/07/opensuse-113.html) and in [NÃ¼rnberg](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/07/16/opensuse-11-3-launch-party-in-nurnberg/).

After 24 hours, it's time to write up a few numbers as well. A total of 49599 requests for ISOs were reached via our download redirector.

I'd like to thank our mirrors and those that funded them.  Just some examples:  RWTH Aachen was distributing openSUSE 11.3 with peaks of 4 GBit/s using two mirrors and they set up a few extra machines to seed via bittorrent - their largest server was sponsored by Fujitsu and will soon be upgraded from 2 GBit/s to 10 GBit/s.

Novell's IS&T team helped us to distribute using the AkamaiÂ  network. Download peaked around 17 GBit/s and data transferred the last 24 hrs was above 90 Terabytes.

**Update:** GWDG had three ftp servers, ftp5 was saturating its 2 GBit/s for the first 6 hours, and the other two gave about half of their 1 GBit/s.

Looking at the torrents, our tracker tells us that 10668 ISOs have been downloaded during the first 26 hours.

Thanks a lot to all that made the launch a real success!

Have a lot of fun with openSUSE 11.3!
