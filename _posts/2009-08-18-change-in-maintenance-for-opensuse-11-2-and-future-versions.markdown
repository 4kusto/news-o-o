Michael LÃ¶ffler [has announced](//lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-announce/2009-08/msg00009.html) to the [opensuse-announce](//lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-announce/) mailing list:



<blockquote></blockquote>

With regards to [the discontinuation mail for openSUSE 10.3](//lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-announce/2009-08/msg00008.html) sent out by Marcus the other day I'd like to clarify the changes in the maintenance period of openSUSE.

openSUSE will shorten the maintenance period to 2 versions plus 2 months which translates with the current release cycle of 8 months to 18 months instead of 24 months we had with openSUSE 11.1 and previous releases.

With that we now can guarantee an overlap time from a maintenance perspective which gives enough time to update machines to newer versions.

Best
