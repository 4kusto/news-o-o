[![](https://en.opensuse.org/images/thumb/9/9c/Networking_dister.png/400px-Networking_dister.png)](http://tinyurl.com/qgqrc8t)We at openSUSE team have been faced with one slight difficulty. We need to track people interested in the workshops so we can assure you can fit in beforehand, tell you some info from the workshop authors where they tell you what you should have with you or what is the workshop plan, and lastly even collect your suggestions.

For this purpose we created

[ad-hoc-hacky google docs file](http://tinyurl.com/qgqrc8t).

Where you are interested in the parts "Attendees list" which is obviously list of interested people (green is done byÂ  TomÃ¡Å¡ ChvÃ¡tal to the amount of expected people to be there, it is NOT a hard limit, on the registration later on there will be printed sheet with the workshops which have the hardlimit, so you can write in even if you are not sure right now). Other list isÂ  "Atendees suggestions" which is just field where you can express your ideas what you expect from the event or what you wish from the author to do.

We would also like to apologise that we didn't do this up-front during your registration, which we simply forgot (mea culpa) but for the next conference it is on the list and will be implemented in the OSEM tool which handles our sweet conference management.

See you all on the conference!
