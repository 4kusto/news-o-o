Flatpak 0.6.13 arrived in the [20161028 snapshot ](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-10/msg00672.html) last week and complements another package updated in the snapshot; [OSTree](https://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 2016.12, which is a tool that combines a "git-like" model for committing and downloading bootable filesystem trees, along with a layer for deploying them and managing the bootloader configuration.

The “new feature will surely need some testing,” wrote Dominique Leuenberger, in his [weekly review](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-10/msg00645.html) about Tumbleweed to the Factory Mailing List.

[Snapshot 20161028](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-10/msg00672.html) also provided several updated packages in the repositories including [Mozilla Firefox 49.0.2](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/49.0.2/releasenotes/) and [Frameworks 5.27.0](https://www.kde.org/announcements/kde-frameworks-5.27.0.php), which provides new mimetypes icons in the version.

<!-- more -->Additions to openSUSE specific packages include Yast2-storage 3.1.105, which fixed installing required storage packages for unmounted filesystems, and yast2-http-server 3.2.1, which added 'Options' option for Directory-sections.

The Halloween snapshot that followed wasn’t too wasn’t scary. [Snapshot 20161031 ](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-11/msg00012.html)added some subpackages for [Apparmor](http://wiki.apparmor.net/index.php/Main_Page) and dbus-1-glib. Gstreamer-transcoder updated descriptions and the updated version of [Kiwi](http://opensuse.github.io/kiwi/) (7.04.8) improves the changelog section.

The latest Tumbleweed [snapshot 20161101](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-11/msg00032.html)  brought new versions of [Hexchat](https://hexchat.github.io) (2.12.3), [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/announce/1.9.22) (1.9.22) and [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) (7.31), which is a utility for network exploration and security auditing.

The two snapshots before the Flatpak snapshot ([snapshot 20161026](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-10/msg00633.html) and  [snapshot 20161025](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-10/msg00618.html)) brought some other software treats like a new version of GNOME games (3.22.1), [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) (4.4.) and [NetworkManager-openvpn](https://openvpn.net/) (1.2.6).
