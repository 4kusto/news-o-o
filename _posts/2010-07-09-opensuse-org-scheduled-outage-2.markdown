On **Saturday, July 10th from [09:00 AM CET](//www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_UTC.aspx?y=2010&mo=07&d=10&h=7&mn=00) to 03:00 PM CET**, our infrastructure vendor will be shutting down services in the Nuremberg (Germany) data center to allow for a scheduled maintenance of the main power supply. As result, general network connectivity from and to the location will not be available.

Due to a separate maintenance activity the openSUSE [Build Service](//en.opensuse.org/Build_Service) will only be available again by [07:00 PM CET](//www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_UTC.aspx?y=2010&mo=07&d=10&h=17&mn=00).

As result, the following services will not be available:

* //build.opensuse.org
* //software.opensuse.org

* //svn.opensuse.org
* //community.opensuse.org
* //education.opensuse.org
* //powerpc.opensuse.org
* //boosters.opensuse.org
* //board.opensuse.org
* //users.opensuse.org
* //hermes.opensuse.org
* //notify.opensuse.org
* //retro.opensuse.org
* //connect.opensuse.org
* //crashdb.opensuse.org
* //gallery.opensuse.org
* //shop.opensuse.org
* //help.opensuse.org
* //i18n.opensuse.org
* //apparmor.opensuse.org
* //count(er|down).opensuse.org
* //gcc.opensuse.org
* //license.opensuse.org
* //xgl.opensuse.org
* //pluginfinder.opensuse.org

The staging version of these sites will be similarly affected.

Please spread the news about this, so that we can keep user disruption to a minimum.
