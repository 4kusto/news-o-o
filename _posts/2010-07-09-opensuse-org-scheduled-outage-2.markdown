On **Saturday, July 10th from [09:00 AM CET](http://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_UTC.aspx?y=2010&mo=07&d=10&h=7&mn=00) to 03:00 PM CET**, our infrastructure vendor will be shutting down services in the Nuremberg (Germany) data center to allow for a scheduled maintenance of the main power supply. As result, general network connectivity from and to the location will not be available.

Due to a separate maintenance activity the openSUSE [Build Service](http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service) will only be available again by [07:00 PM CET](http://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_UTC.aspx?y=2010&mo=07&d=10&h=17&mn=00).

As result, the following services will not be available:

* http://build.opensuse.org
* http://software.opensuse.org

* http://svn.opensuse.org
