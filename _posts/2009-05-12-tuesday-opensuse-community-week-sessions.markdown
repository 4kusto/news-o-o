The [openSUSE Community Week](http://en.opensuse.org/Community_Week) is going strong! Monday kicked off with a number of really informative and well-attended sessions on [GNOME, KDE, testing, packaging, and more](http://news.opensuse.org/2009/05/11/monday-community-week-sessions/). Tuesday is even more chock full of fun, with more sessions and plenty of openSUSE contributors on hand. If you want to get involved in openSUSE there's no time like the present!

Our community week is a chance to get people from around the world together at the same time to focus on specific topics, and to transfer knowledge about openSUSE to help grow our teams. The idea is to cover topics to improve our community by broadening our knowledge, and to enable new contributors to openSUSE and open source.
