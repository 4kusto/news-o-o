![tumbleweed](/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tumbleweed1.png)If you're a Tumbleweed and KDE aficionado, this is a good day. You'll see some major updates:



	
  * Plasma 5.4.2

	
  * Frameworks 5.15

	
  * Applications 15.08.2

	
  * Qt 5.5.1


Now, yes, that's all minor versions but stability is a big deal!

Qt 5.5.0 brought some problems for Intel users and this new version, combined with the improvements in the updates from the KDE community, brings a much nicer and more reliable experience to users.

<!-- more -->Some more detail about the fixes:

	
  * updated keyboard configuration, new and updated icons, Bluetooth updates and window management fixes in Plasma 5.4.2 ([details](https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.4.2.php))

	
  * A more reliable KWallet, more stable and faster Baloo search, and many other stability fixes in Frameworks 5.15 ([details](https://www.kde.org/announcements/kde-frameworks-5.15.0.php))

	
  * Updates to Ark (drag and drop should work reliably now), Kdenlive (many stability fixes), KDEPIM (fix scrolling issues, memory leaks and some crashes) and many more in KDE Applications 15.08.2 ([details](https://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-applications-15.08.2.php))
