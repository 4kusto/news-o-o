![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bali-168x300.png)For the second time, Indonesia was chosen to host the openSUSE.Asia Summit 2019 event. A similar event was held in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, in 2016 and was attended by hundreds of local [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org) lover as well as from other Asian countries. This year we are challenged to repeat the successful story of the openSUSE.Asia Summit on one of the most exotic islands in Indonesia, Bali.

openSUSE.Asia Summit is an event awaited by fans of openSUSE in Indonesia in particular, and activists of Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) in general. In this activity, experts, contributors, end users, and technology enthusiasts gather to share experiences about the development of openSUSE and other things related to FLOSS and have a lot of fun.

The island of Bali was chosen as the venue for the openSUSE.Asia Summit after being proposed by the Indonesian community during [openSUSE.Asia Summit 2018](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/summitasia18) in Taipei, Taiwan. After going through a long discussion, the [Asian committee](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Asia_Organization_Committee) chose Bali as the host of openSUSE.Asia Summit 2019. openSUSE.Asia Summit 2019 will be from October 5 to October 6, 2019, at [Udayana University, Bali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udayana_University).

Goals to be achieved in the openSUSE.Asia Summit 2019 in Bali include:



 	
  * To promote openSUSE in the Asian region.

 	
  * To provide an alternative to the wider community that FLOSS can be a powerful tool for doing their daily job.

 	
  * To attract new contributors for openSUSE from Indonesia and other Asian countries.

 	
  * To provide a forum for sharing user and developer experiences because usually such discussions only occur online.


In the end, we are proud to present Bali Island to become one of the historical places for the openSUSE.Asia Summit :")

**Pre-announcement**

openSUSE.Asia Summit 2019 will immediately open a call for paper for prospective speakers. In addition, we will also open a logo competition for the openSUSE.Asia Summit 2019. Surely this will be an opportunity for designers in Asia to compete with each other to show their abilities and contribute to this activity. We will inform you of more details about the above information in the near future through [news.opensuse.org](https://news.opensuse.org).

See you in Bali and have fun!
