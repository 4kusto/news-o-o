Novell is once again sponsoring Hack Week -- and we want you to be in on it! Hack Week III (HW3) runs from August 25th through August 29th.





What's Hack Week? Hack Week is a chance for Novell's developers to work on Innovation Time Off (ITO) projects, uninterrupted by normal hacking duties. This helps provide an opportunity for Novell's developers to work on innovative new projects they might not normally be able to work on. Since most of the projects developed during Hack Week are open source, this also benefits the community by providing new code.





During Hack Week, developers can work on any project of interest. So far Hack Week has spawned a number of impressive projects and improvements, such as Debian package support in the openSUSE Build Service, Tasque, Giver, and many others.





For HW3, we're encouraging members of the openSUSE community to get involved as well, either by working on their own Hack Week projects, or by collaborating with Novell developers to create or enhance open source projects.





We are sponsoring travel for a limited number of contributors. If you're interested in working on a project in person, please contact Andreas Jaeger (aj@suse.de) by August 12th. We will also be announcing ways for community contributors to participate in Hack Week III remotely, stay tuned to news.opensuse.org and opensuse-announce for details.
