[![Screen Shot 2015-09-10 at 15.46.06 copy](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-10-at-15.46.06-copy.png)Snapshot 20160808](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-08/msg00200.html) brought openSUSE [Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) users [Plasma 5.72](https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma5.0/) shortly after last week's article was published, but it didn’t last long.

This week Tumbleweed appears to have a strong wind making it roll remarkably fast as openSUSE’s popular rolling release had six snapshots since the last update was published.

The latest [snapshot, 20160815,](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-08/msg00290.html) was fairly small updating [gstreamer-plugins-bad](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/modules/gst-plugins-bad.html), libgusb and [opus](https://www.opus-codec.org/) codecs.

[Snapshot 20160813](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-08/msg00262.html) updated repositories for [systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) and kernel-source were updated to enable missing BayTrail and LynxPoint drivers. Yast2-firstboot was updated in this snapshot as well as a snapshot the day before. The multipath-tools package had the most fixes and cleanup in the [20160813 snapshot](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-08/msg00262.html).

Some users might already be using the latest version of Mozilla Firefox after the [20160812 snapshot](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-08/msg00256.html), which updated [Firefox to version 48](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/48). Plasma 5.72 had a very short life in Tumbleweed as version [5.7.3](https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.7.3.php) rolled over the previous version that arrived just four days earlier. Other notable updates in the [snapshot](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-08/msg00256.html) were [qemu](//wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page), NetworkManager-openvpn and [gfxboot](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Gfxboot).

[Snapshot 20160811](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-08/msg00248.html) had only two packages update in Tumbleweed, but there were a significant amount of patches and cleanup for [grub2](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/).<!-- more -->

Updates for gnome-photos to 3.20.3, [wine to 1.9.16](https://www.winehq.org/news/2016080501), and [xen](https://www.xenproject.org/) to 4.7.0_10 were just a few of the many updates that made it into [snapshot 20160810](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-08/msg00231.html). Libnfs and libvirt  were updated in the snapshot. [Python3-setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools) updated to 25.1.6 and a few updates for [YaST](//yast.github.io/) virtual machine and network were also in the [snapshot](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-08/msg00231.html).
