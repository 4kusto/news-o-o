Less than 48 hours from when GNOMEâ€™s release team unveiled version [3.22 (Karlsruhe)](https://www.gnome.org/news/2016/09/gnome-3-22-released-the-future-is-now/), [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) users are getting the full upstream experience of the latest GNOME.

Snapshot [20160921](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-09/msg00396.html) made 3.22 available to user, but there were plenty of other snapshots during the week that brought new packages to Tumbleweed users.

Dominique Leuenberger, a member of the openSUSE release team, wrote that there were five snapshots this week in an email to developers on the [openSUSE Factory Mailing List](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/).

The [Linux Kernel updated to 4.7.4 ](https://www.kernel.org/)and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) updated a version in the [20160920](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-09/msg00378.html) snapshot. Snapshot [20160914](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-09/msg00312.html) updated KDE Frameworks to 5.26.0 and KDE Applications 16.08.1.

Even though Tumbleweed is built on [GNU Composite Compiler 6.2.1](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-6/changes.html), for user relying on GCC 5, snapshot [20160917](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-09/msg00330.html) provided an update to GCC 5.4.1 and there was a major version update for Vim, which is the [first major update for the project in a decade](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/vim_dev/CmiGxtJ7fn4/DzdTuTtIAQAJ) and updated from version 7.4.2045 to version 8.0.3.
