[![Tumbleweed-black](/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Tumbleweed-black.png)openSUSE Leap 42.2 Alpha 1](//download.opensuse.org/distribution/leap/42.2/), which is now available for testing, made some news last week, but this week’s news focuses more on [openSUSE’s rolling distribution](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed).

Developers have been focusing on  moving [Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) to [GNU Compiler Collection 6](https://gcc.gnu.org/), which is always challenging for a distribution.

In the openSUSE Tumbleweed’s [Review of the Weeks 2016/21](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-05/msg00470.html) email sent out last week by Dominique Leuenberger, he listed the [progression of moving GCC 6](https://en.opensuse.org/Move_to_Gcc6) to the default compiler, which can be viewed on the [wiki](https://en.opensuse.org/Move_to_Gcc6).

Leuenberger also hinted at the [Linux Kernel 4.6](https://www.kernel.org/) possibly being ready for a snapshot this week. It looks like 4.6 will be in a snapshot with week along with [KDE Applications 16.04.1](https://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-applications-16.04.1.php) and [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) 5.24.

This week had three openSUSE Tumbleweed snapshots. New perl and wine package updates are in the Tumbleweed repository from [snapshot 20160530](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-05/msg00497.html) .

<!-- more -->Several main KDE packages in [snapshot 20160529](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-05/msg00483.html) were updated to version 16.04.1 to include kalgebra, libkdegames, ksudoku, konquest and the Japanese reference/learning tool kiten. [GNOME’s gtk3](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/) updated from 3.20.4 to 3.20.6 in the snapshot and libvirt has updated subpackages mostly for drivers as well as some for client, storage and daemon-config-network. Yast2-dns-server is available for update with version 3.1.21 in the Tumbleweed repositories.

Wayland-protocols 1.4 became available in the [20160526 snapshot](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-05/msg00473.html). Xf86-input-evdev added a kiosk mode for touch screens patch in that snapshot as well and linux-glibc-devel 4.6 had an update to kernel headers 4.6. Xorg-x11-server also had a small update.
