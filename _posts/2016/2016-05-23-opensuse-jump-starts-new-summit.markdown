Last week, members of [The GNOME Project](https://www.gnome.org/) announced a new conference in the United States northwest to enhance the GNU/Linux application ecosystem.

The [Libre Application Summit](//las.gnome.org/), which will take place in Portland, Oregon, from Sept. 19 - 23, aims to empower application developers both big and small as well as enhance app developers collaboratation with major Linux distributions.

The summit, which is designed to improve the developer and user experience for the GNU/Linux desktop, has a lot of potential to expand and openSUSE is excited to be the summitâ€™s first sponsor.

Since last year, openSUSE has been working together with GNOME members to offer an event in the Portland designed for application developers who want to explore opportunities for expanding apps to distributions, to build personal relationship with users and to explore opportunities to monetize developers apps.

<!-- more -->Entrepreneurs and open-source enthusiasts are encouraged to attend if they are interested in building a product based on free and open source software.


#### The summit will focus on the following topics:


**Ecosystem:** business, legal, community, and social issues

**Platforms:** deep low-level topics around hardware, drivers, and tools

**Distribution:** collaborating with established distributions (like openSUSE), inter-distribution cooperation, QA and continuous integration.

**Development:** toolkits, X/Wayland, security, runtimes, SDK, development tools.
