![dotsgeeko1](/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/dotsgeeko1.png)November brought [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) users an early holiday gift with 24 snapshots of new software and four updated [Linux Kernels](https://www.kernel.org/).

The [continuous snapshot streak](https://news.opensuse.org/2016/11/23/tumbleweed-delivers-incredible-snapshot-streak-newest-kernel/) of Tumbleweed updates ended with snapshot [20161123](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-11/msg00493.html), which brought Kernel 4.8.10.

More updates were in the [20161123](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-11/msg00493.html) snapshot such as updates of yast2-storage to version 3.2.1 and Yast2-bootloader to version 3.2.10.

The streak-breaking snapshot, [20161125](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-11/msg00532.html), brought several goodies like [GTK](https://www.gtk.org/) 3.22.4, which saw Wayland patch dropped due to a fix upstream, and an update to KDE’s [Plasma 5.8.4](https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.8.4.php), which included several [small but important bug fixes](https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.8.4.php).

Oracle’s Virtualbox updated to 5.1.10 in the [20161125](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-11/msg00532.html) snapshot and provided fixes for various issues to improve the graphical user interface. ImageMagick’s updates to version 6.9.6.5 provided a fix to improve data compression decoding. Web browser [Epiphany](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Web) added the missing F1 keyboard shortcut to open help with an update in Tumbleweed to version 3.22.3.

Updates found in the repositories with the [20161128](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-11/msg00654.html) snapshot added some upstream patches for [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) and [Wine](https://wiki.winehq.org/Main_Page) updated [winetricks](https://wiki.winehq.org/Winetricks) in version 1.9.24.

Snapshot [20161122](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-11/msg00469.html) updated Mozilla [Thunderbird to 45.5](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/45.5.0/releasenotes/) and advanced text editor [Vim](//www.vim.org/) to 8.0.92.
