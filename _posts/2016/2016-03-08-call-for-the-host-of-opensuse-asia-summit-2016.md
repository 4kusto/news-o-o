The openSUSE.Asia organization committee is inviting proposals to host the openSUSE.Asia Summit during the later half of 2016 (July to the middle of October). The openSUSE.Asia Summit is the largest annual openSUSE conference in Asia and is attended by over 400 contributors, enthusiasts from all over Asia

The event focuses primarily on the openSUSE distribution and its applications for personal and enterprise use. It brings together the openSUSE community in Asia to provide a forum for users, developers, foundation leaders, governments and businesses to discuss both the present technology and future developments.


### **Past Summits**


The last openSUSE.Asia Summit was held in Taipei, Taiwan in 2015. The Summit’s preference is to find new locations each year as we spread openSUSE throughout Asia, and we are looking for local organizers to rise to the challenge of organizing an excellent openSUSE event. We need individuals and communities to get together and organize a successful openSUSE.Asia Summit. The openSUSE.Asia organization committee assists throughout the  proces. You can learn more about openSUSE.Asia Summit at the following web sites:
