![Tumbleweed-black-green](/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Tumbleweed-black-green.png)Last week’s updates to [Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Tumbleweed_installation) brought several new packages to [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/)’s rolling release like Kmail 5, KDE Framework 5.18.0 and updates to Perl and YaST.

This week’s [snapshot](//lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-01/msg00475.html) has KDE Applications [15.12.1](https://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-applications-15.12.1.php), which contains only bugfixes and translation updates, and the virtual globe and world atlas [Marble](https://marble.kde.org/) updated to from 15.08.3 to the [15.12.1](https://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-applications-15.12.1.php) version.

Libre Office updated to 5.1.0.2. Perl Image ExifTool’s update to 10.10 provided several visual equipment updates and the notes related to the update provided some criticism of programmers from a camera manufacturer.

Auto YaST updated to 3.1.113 fixing the warning message about the 'init' section not being processed. GNOME Bluetooth updates to 3.18.2 and Mesa to 11.1.1.

Perl XML XPath updated to 1.24 and Snapper updated to 0.2.10, which added conditional compilation of installation-helper.
