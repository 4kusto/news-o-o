We are happy to announce the third openSUSE.Asia Summit. The openSUSE.Asia Summit 2016 will take place at Sunan Kalijaga State Islamic University in [Yogyakarta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogyakarta), Indonesia on October 1st and 2nd, 2016.

The summit is a great way for both openSUSE contributors, and, users to meet each other and have fun. The openSUSE community will get together, share their experiences, and, learn free and open source technologies.

The objectives of Summit are:
