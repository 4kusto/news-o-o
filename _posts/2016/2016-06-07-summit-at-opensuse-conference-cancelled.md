![oscfinal](/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/oscfinal-1.png)The [openSUSE project](https://www.opensuse.org/) announces the immediate cancellation of the ownCloud Summit that was scheduled to take place during the [openSUSE Conference](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC16) in two weeks.

The summit was scheduled for June 22 - 23.

Given the ownCloud community has forked, openSUSE sought an amicable solution so that both communities could take part in the openSUSE conference. As this was found to not be possible, the [openSUSE Board](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board) made the decision to cancel the summit.

Community members from these communities are welcome to attend the openSUSE conference.

Attendees are expected to behave in accordance to the [openSUSE Guiding Principles](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Guiding_principles).

The conference will take place in Nuremberg at the [Z Bau](//z-bau.com/) June 22 - 26.
