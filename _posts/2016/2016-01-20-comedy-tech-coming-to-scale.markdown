The stage is set for the 14th annual [Southern California Linux Expo](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/14x) in Pasadena, Calif., this week and openSUSE will be apart of the scheduled entertainment and tech talks.[![](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/sites/default/files/promo/imspeakingat-400.png)](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org)

openSUSE will have a booth at the event with several experts that can answer questions attendees of SCALE have related to open source and openSUSE. Learn about [Tumbleweed, Leap, YaST, the Open Build Service and more](https://www.opensuse.org/).

The chameleon enthusiast will also participate in several of the evening events. openSUSE will contribute to the Game Night on Saturday at 8 p.m., so come play games and talk with open-source enthusiast.

Two talks scheduled for Saturday at 6 p.m. are openSUSE related. [Mark Fasheh](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/14x/presentations/dedupe-btrfs), a Linux kernel developer for SUSE Labs, will have a talk about de-duplication on btrfs, which is the default file system for openSUSE, and I will talk about [automated testing with openQA](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/14x/presentations/openqa).

Fasheh will also provide a [short introduction on duperemove](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/13x/presentations/duperemove-dedupe-btrfs) tool on Thursday. Later that evening, [Bryan Lunduke](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/14x/presentations/linux-sucks) will entertain and fall short of any reasonable thoughts in his Linux Sucks tour. Lunduke will also join his fellow tech pundits from [Bad Voltage](//www.badvoltage.org/live/) to have a Live show on Friday at 8 p.m.

There is much more to see at SCALE and tons of entertainment. Cya you there. Â Have a lot of fun!!
