With the days closing in on us before the next great openSUSE Conference in Nuremberg, Germany 11-14 September, 2011, we're seeing a lot of awesome papers being submitted to the Conference Program Committee.Â  But there's still time for you to submit that awesome session you've dreamed of. The deadline to  [submit your paper](http://conference.opensuse.org/indico//conferenceDisplay.py?confId=2) is [midnight July 25th](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=25&month=7&year=2011&hour=0&min=0&sec=0&p1=0).


## What We Are Looking For:


This year's Conference theme is RWXÂ³.Â  That means its an open conference in which we all get to roll up our sleeves and get [![rwx3 logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/RWX3.png)](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/05/16/opensuse-conference-2011-to-be-creative-and-open/rwx3/)involved!Â  We're looking for that great session that talks about FOSS projects, openSUSE Community growth, andÂ  workshops that empower our users and contributors to do more awesome stuff.


## Types of Sessions you can apply for





	
  * Presentation

	
  * [Birds of a Feather (BoF)](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/06/14/opensuse-conference-and-rw-sessions-the-bof/)

	
  * [Workshops](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/07/13/opensuse-and-rw-sessions-the-workshop/)

	
  * Hacksessions


As you can see, the possibilities are endless.Â  And this year's conference, which is always free, is extra special because we'll be moving to our new location, Zentrifuge, and co-hosting with the SUSE Labs Conerence.Â  That's two for the price of one and one is FREE!


## What's Next





	
  1. Submit your proposal [here](http://conference.opensuse.org/indico//conferenceDisplay.py?confId=2)

	
  2. The Program Committee will be reviewing all submissions and making their votes before August 1.

	
  3. After August 5, we will announce the accepted proposals and contact you with the status of your proposal.


Remember, the deadline is this Sunday, July 24th!
