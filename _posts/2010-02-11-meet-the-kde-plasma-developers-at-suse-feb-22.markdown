On the evening of Monday the 22nd of February, the KDE Plasma, KWin and Oxygen developers will be holding a public event at the [SUSE office in Nuremberg](//www.novell.com/de-de/company/contact/gs-nuernberg/), Germany.  All are welcome to come to the openSUSE Community Space to hear the KDE hackers present their vision of the state of the art in user interfaces.

This evening forms part of the 4th Plasma coding sprint, codenamed '[Tokamak4](//techbase.kde.org/Projects/Plasma/Tokamak4)'.  Sponsored by KDE e.V. and Novell, twenty-five leading KDE developers will be coming together from all over the world to work on the Plasma Desktop for future versions of KDE Workspaces, including the desktop and netbook shells, the window manager, and the desktop look and feel.  With KDE SC 4.4 still burning up broadband lines and download mirrors everywhere, the developers are moving on to address important challenges for the next release, including empowering Plasma with semantic technologies, easier extensions using JavaScript and other scripting languages, enhancing mobile devices with Plasma interfaces, and enriching the desktop with more Web content from Project Silk.

For many years, there has been close cooperation between SUSE and upstream desktop projects.  For KDE, this has resulted in the Kiosk lockdown framework, the love-it-or-hate-it Kickoff application launcher, usability testing and more recently the openSUSE Air theming for 11.2, KNetworkManager and integration with Firefox and OpenOffice.

The doors open to the public at 1800 in the openSUSE Community Space, Maxtorhof, Maxfeldstr 5, 90409 Nuernberg.  If you're planning to attend, it would be much appreciated if you can let [Will Stephenson](mailto:wstephenson@novell.com) know in advance - but feel free to come along spontaneously.
