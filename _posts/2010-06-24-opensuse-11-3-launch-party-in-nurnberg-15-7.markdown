**What?** We plan to have a presentation of 11.3 and it's improvements, some demo systems,  and lot's of people that care about openSUSE to talk with. You could just bring your notebook to get the latest openSUSE version installed and have a beer with the developers and other users! We will have a big barbecue and franconian beer for all :-)

For the small and big children we will have the openSUSE balloon clown visiting us, creating geekos and other animals like on Linuxtag.
