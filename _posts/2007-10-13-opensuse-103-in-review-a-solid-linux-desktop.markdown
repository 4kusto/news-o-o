As the first [reviews](http://en.opensuse.org/In_the_Press) start to roll in, TuxMachines have [just released](http://www.tuxmachines.org/node/20958) one of the first comprehensive reviews of openSUSE 10.3, concluding that it is a mature, stable, free Linux distribution:

_"Underneath its new green artwork, version 10.3's improvements over previous versions include cutting down the time it takes to reach the graphical login screen; speeding up and streamlining its package management utility; and making it easier for users to install software using a new "one-click install" process."_
