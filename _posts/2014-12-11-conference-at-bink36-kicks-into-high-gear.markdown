We are ready to get this year's Geeko-hack party started in The Hague, Netherlands, from May 1 to May 5.
Before the learning, hacking and partying begins at the four-day openSUSE Conference, the community needs to know what's happening with oSC15 or better yet, help with the event planning.
This year's theme “Flexibility through Diversity” offers much for the community to discuss. With openSUSE's worldwide ecosystem, communicating and collaborating with open-source peers requires flexibility. The diversity of openSUSE creates an environment filled with opportune, learning and fun.

The following tracks that have been proposed for OSC15:



	
  * Collaboration and Cooperation

	
  * Business and Outcome track

	
  * Project & OSS Leadership

	
  * Technology & Development


A logo for oSC15 has already been selected and the website is taking shape leading up to the conference. Visitors will be able to submit papers, register for the conference and view the schedule at [http://conference.opensuse.org](http://conference.opensuse.org).
More details will be annouced about the Call for Papers, which will close Feb. 14.


### **Know the location before you go**


Here is a little info about The Hague before you plan your trip. The Hague is located between Amsterdam (69km) and Rotterdam (26km). The conference will be at a time when the city gets the most sunshine hours. Rotterdam The Hague airport receives flights from several European destinations and Amsterdam's airport (Schiphol) is a major hub for flights coming to Europe from all over the world. The Hague is not the capital of the Netherlands, but is the seat of the Dutch government, parliament, Supreme Court and Council of the State. It's one of eight major cities hosting the United Nations. Attendees can see the windmills, wooden shoes, the best soccer team never to be crowned the world champions, cheese, cows, farms and more cheese. The country is well below sea level, but don't worry because chameleons can walk on water. Cya at oSC15.


### **The openSUSE Conference**


The openSUSE Conference is the annual gathering of the openSUSE Community and other Free and Open Source contributors and enthusiasts. This year will be the 7th event where the talks, workshops and discussions provide the framework to exchange knowledge, collaborate and create lasting connections and incredible memories. Last year our event took place in [Dubrovnik, Croatia](https://news.opensuse.org/2014/01/09/opensuse-conference-2014-takes-place-april-24th-28th-in-dubrovnik-croatia) – read reports on [day one](https://news.opensuse.org/2013/07/20/opensuse-conference-2013-the-conference-begins/), [day two](https://news.opensuse.org/2013/07/21/opensuse-conference-2013-2nd-day/) and [day three](https://news.opensuse.org/2013/07/22/opensuse-conference-2013-3rd-day/). Before we’ve had a [smashing time in Prague](https://news.opensuse.org/2013/01/21/the-opensuse-conference-a-few-months-later/) and in a [old factory hall in Nuremberg](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/09/15/opensuse-conference-fun/). It's going to be off the chain in The Hague.
