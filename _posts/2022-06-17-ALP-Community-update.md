[Community workgroup](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:ALP/Workgroups/Community) for ALP would like to update you on what has happened since the openSUSE Conference 2022. Make sure to check the panel discussion with the ALP steering committee and other [talks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_AMhvchzBae22JG6CeBsSpjdrgMaeyN7) from oSCON22 as they become public.

First, there is a new official communication channel! We're using the "openSUSE ALP" matrix channel, bridged with https://discord.gg/opensuse and ircs://libera.chat/#opensuse-alp. Whatever you use, we've got you covered! This is the best way how to consume updates.

We have revisited the way how we'd like to [communicate](https://news.opensuse.org/2022/06/15/community-aims-to-grow-comms-marketing-team/) updates on ALP. The idea is to switch away from the digest report for all workgroups to something a bit easier to follow and more exciting to read.

We've invited our newly appointed Engineering Director Marco Varlese to the weekly ALP CWG [meeting](https://etherpad.opensuse.org/p/weeklymeeting20220607), and we have some great news to share!

We've received confirmation about the upcoming Roadmap. Delivery of Proof of Concept is targetting September 2022, and public availability of an ALP Based product in September 2023.

Next Tuesday Marco will work with Robert Sirchia from the SUSE's Community team on a suse.com article about the strategy and vision for the Adaptable Linux Platform. We'd like to then interview individual work groups and share some updates in a story-telling way and communicate better how they fit the bigger picture shared by Marco. Dan Čermák will put together a sorted list of WGs by the impact on the openSUSE community. This will make sure that the interviews are as relevant as possible.

We've had [Quality Engineering](https://news.opensuse.org/2022/06/16/ALP-Quality-Engineering-update/) over this week. For next Tuesday, we've invited Jiří Šrain and Frederic Crozat from the ALP steering committee, with whom we'd like to discuss building of the community part of ALP, essentially the Package Hub for ALP. The remaining items on our radar are a test instance of Fedocal and centralized documentation.
