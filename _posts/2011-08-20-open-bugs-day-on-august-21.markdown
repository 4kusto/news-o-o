The Testing Core Team has decided to hold our third [Open Bugs Day ](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Open-Bugs-Day)(OBD) on Sunday August 21 from 0:00 to 23:59 UTC.

<!-- more -->To ensure that all the testers are using the same code base, we are making Virtual Machines available on our server. For those people that wish to test on their own hardware, there will be KDE and Gnome virtual images available at [http://www5.zq1.de/img/](http://www5.zq1.de/img/), and distribution snapshots available at [http://mirror.zq1.de/opensuse/factory/iso/](http://mirror.zq1.de/opensuse/factory/iso/). The virtual images have been prepared with KVM and tested with VirtualBox, and are compressed to a little over 900 MB. Instructions for using them in a VirtualBox VM are posted at the [Open Bugs Day wiki page](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Open-Bugs-Day).

The purpose of this OBD is to test the open bugs reported for openSUSE 11.4 to see which of them are still affecting 12.1. As there are over 1300 open bugs for 11.4, we have a major job to do. If you have any time available on August 21,Â  please join us. Use Channel #opensuse-testing on the Freenode IRC Network to get started.
