If you have fun, the rest is easy...


[![Classic main menu ](https://en.opensuse.org/images/thumb/0/01/Life131-mate11.png/796px-Life131-mate11.png)](https://en.opensuse.org/Screenshots#openSUSE_Edu_Li-f-e_Mate.2FGnome-classic.2FGnome_Edition)The openSUSE-Education team is proud to announce the availability of another great release: the GNOME classic edition.


This one is nearly identical to the MATE desktop, but already includes a few minor bug fixes and some additional applications:



	
  * [scite editor](http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html)

	
  * [kompozer](http://kompozer.net/)

	
  * [rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)


are added to the (already huge) [list of available applications](http://download.opensuse-education.org/ISOs/openSUSE-Edu-li-f-e-gnome-classic.x86_64-13.1.1.iso-packages.html).

Quoting Jigish Gohil:


<blockquote>classic is so much better than standard gnomeÂ  i wonder why it is not standard</blockquote>


BTW: openSUSE Education releases always contain the latest official openSUSE updates and other cool stuff, so you should be able to get an up-to date live system up and running in a few seconds/minutes (depending on your hardware) - which can also be installed on your local hard disk with just a few mouse clicks. Just click on the "Live-Install" icon on the desktop.
