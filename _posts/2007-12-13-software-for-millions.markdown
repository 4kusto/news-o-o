Klaas wrote an article about the openSUSE Build Service that got published in the german edition of Linux Magazin. Everyone able to read german go [here](//www.linux-magazin.de/heft_abo/ausgaben/2008/01/software_fuer_millionen).



It covers general introduction into openSUSE's Build Service, tutorials how to build a simple package, touches upon OSC and web client and gives an overview over the underlying technology.
