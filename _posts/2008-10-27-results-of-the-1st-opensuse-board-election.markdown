So the polls are closed now and all votes have been accounted for and confirmed valid, and we are now proud to announce the election results! The openSUSE project would like to welcome the [first community elected](http://en.opensuse.org/Board/Election/2008) board, and would like to thank all voters for taking the time to use their vote.

The new [board members](http://en.opensuse.org/Board) are, from the Non-Novell side of the community Pascal Bleser and Bryen Yunashko and from the Novell side we have Henne Vogelsang and Federico Mena-Quintero. We are proud to announce that Michael LÃ¶ffler has been appointed by Novell as chairman of the new board. Being the candidates with the most votes in their category, Pascal and Henne already agreed to serve the board for the next two years. Bryen and Federico have been elected for one next year, hence the next [election](http://en.opensuse.org/Board_Election) will take place about the same time next year.

The election committee would like to congratulate them on their election and wish them all the best in steering our fine community and project. We would also like to thank all of the candidates for their interest in serving on the board, and we're proud to have so many excellent candidates to choose from for the board.

For those that like numbers, the spread of votes is as follows:

</tbody></table>
A total of 75.11% (178 of 237) voters participated in the poll. Voters had the option of casting two votes for each category, for a possible total of 356 votes per category for the election. Some voters, however, choose not to use both of their votes for each category.

The final count does not convey how close the election was in some parts, but it does show that the openSUSE community is committed to ensuring that they take a stake in their own project and that the understand that to make the project prosper they need to be active.

The election committee wants to thank the first openSUSE Board, Marcus 'darix' RÃ¼ckert and Joe 'Zonker' Brockmeier for their ongoing support. In addition to this we want to thank again all openSUSE members for their participation. Sadly these expectations can get tarnished by a drop of pace in the mb2-701 microsoft dynamics crm 2013 exam pdf [online free homework help cis](https://homeworkhelper.net/) questions training
