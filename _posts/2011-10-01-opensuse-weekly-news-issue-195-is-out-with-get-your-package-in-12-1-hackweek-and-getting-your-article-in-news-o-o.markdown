[Get
your package in Factory for 12.1!](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/09/27/get-your-package-in-factory-for-12-1/)


The [upcoming openSUSE 12.1 release](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:12.1)
is being developed in [Factory](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Factory).
According to the [release
schedule](http://www.suse.de/%7Ecoolo/opensuse_12.1/) the Toolchain and several other critical components are frozen, but there
is still time to get most package updates in! Itâ€™s not hard to do that, especially if you
build packages on [the Open Build Service](http://openbuildservice.org)
anyway and you get your software to be part of openSUSE! Read on to learn more. (...)

[Cornelius
Schumacher: SUSE hack week](http://blog.cornelius-schumacher.de/2011/09/suse-hack-week.html)


[Hack week](http://hackweek.opensuse.org/). One week of ferocious
hacking on new ideas without interruptions. [SUSE](http://www.suse.com/)
does this twice a year to trigger those innovations, you can't realize when you are swamped by
day-to-day work. Of course it's not the only way or opportunity to do new things, but it gives
the freedom to actually get something done on a topic, which is not covered by conventional
product planning. It's productive, it's fun, it creates great results.Ã½Next week it's the
[seventh edition
of hack week](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/09/22/suse-hackweek-7-next-week/). We are collecting ideas and activities in [openFATE](http://bit.ly/n5laxM).

[Michal
ÄŒihaÅ™: GePeS - another hacweek project](http://blog.cihar.com/archives/2011/09/26/gepes-another-hacweek-project/)


With no clear plans for [Hackweek](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Hackweek) this year, I decided to play even more with N950. As I quite lack some GPS
application I decided to write it :-). The feature set will be based on things I would use,
though I still think it will be useful for others:






	
  * Display basic GPS info (coordinates, speed, etc.)

	
  * Compass

	
  * Moon and sun rise and set calculations for current location





I've named the application as GePeS and you can find sources on Gitorious: [https://gitorious.org/gepes](https://gitorious.org/gepes)

During first day I've managed to implement basic things, check screenshots:

##### Top voted Features
















â€œ


[decouple download and installation (Score: 368)](https://features.opensuse.org/120340)


Network installation could be improved by running package download and package
installation in parallel.

â€












â€œ


[Look at plymouth for splash during boot (Score: 191)](https://features.opensuse.org/305493)


I wanted to open a fate feature about this when I first heard of plymouth, but
reading
http://fedoramagazine.wordpress.com/2008/10/21/interview-fedora-10s-better-startup/
really makes me think we should go this way.

Ray's comment starting with "Every flicker and mode change in the boot
process takes away from the whole experience." is especially interesting. Is it
okay to track the "don't show grub by default" here?

â€












â€œ


[1-click uninstall (Score: 165)](https://features.opensuse.org/305305)


An easy way to remove Software! For example: you installed an application with "1-click install" (which will install all the packages that you need), there should be an easy way (also with 1 click) to remove what you have installed with that 1-click operation... in another words: an "1-click Uninstall" to remove installed software (dependencies and packages included).

â€












â€œ


[Update to GRUB v2 (Score: 153)](https://features.opensuse.org/308497)


Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn't
going to go away. The code itself isn't well written or well maintained. Adding a
new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
a static buffer it can use for memory management. It's only 32k. For complex file
systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
taking forever to load bug) because we don't have enough memory to do block mapping
for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)
(...)

â€












â€œ


[Popularity contest (Score: 111)](https://features.opensuse.org/305877)


We need a feedback about packages that are preferred by users and actively used. Debian already has a tool named Popularity contest (popcon)

* reusing popcon will give us results that are directly comparable with Debian and Ubuntu

* packagers team can take care of the package

* we need a configuration dialog in YaST that is visible enough

* we need a server infrastructure on opensuse.org. (There are certain privacy issues, see Debian FAQ for details)

##### Recently requested features











**Features newly requested last week. Please vote and/or comment if you get interested.**





â€œ


[Opensuse 12.1 - integrate PulseAudio 1.0](https://features.opensuse.org/312850)


Among the features of PulseAudio 1.0 is a D-Bus based control protocol, source output volumes, passthrough audio support, echo cancellation support, restored Windows support, and improved sample rate adaptation in the module-rtp-receive module.

â€












â€œ


[make nfs-client setup in YaST to modify /etc/fstab](https://features.opensuse.org/312853)


when setting up a NFS-Client in YaST, it does not modify the /etc/fstab. So it always throws an error message "shares cannot be mounted from /etc/fstab" after one has finished the setup of the shared folders.

So in the current state, the user has to modify the /etc/fstab manually. But when you set up the nfs client in YaST, you already have provided all information to the system and it could easily put all this into the /etc/fstab file.

So if we had such a function, even if it just was a checkbox "write to /etc/fstab" so that experienced users or the ones who want to do something advanced, have the choice not to modify /etc/fstab, this would be great.

â€












â€œ


[make nfs-server and nfs-client setup in YaST themselves deal with the Firewall](https://features.opensuse.org/312854)


when setting up a NFS Server or a NFS client, you can tick "open firewall port" That is really convinient. But there are also other services involved with NFS, which also require some modifications to the firewall.

As far as I understood (I do not have that much clue about all this), it is rpc.mountd and rpc.statd, which need to go through the firewall as well. So the normal user (like me) is not able to setup NFS at home, without switching off the firewall completely as it seems like that you can not force these two services to use ports, which you specify as open.
Switching off the firewall completely is a workaround but it leaves a bitter taste, as it lowers the security.

So it would be cool, if YaST could take care of all services related to NFS in terms of firewall settings and also the settings coming from the NFS setup.

â€












â€œ


[Transion to MariaDB as the default SQL server](https://features.opensuse.org/312858)


Building on this feature from 11.3: Include MariaDB

[https://features.opensuse.org/308937](https://features.opensuse.org/308937)

Given the Oracle ownership of MySQL and their move to an OpenCore development model it is time OpenSUSE transitions away from MySQL as the default database to the MariaDB.

[openSUSE Pizza Parties the Geeko Way](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/09/30/opensuse-pizza-parties-the-geeko-way/)


The new openSUSE 12.1 Release is approaching very soon and all you Geekos should not miss
the opportunity of becoming a double GPM!

Party time starts this weekend and lasts until November 2011 in all Geeko-towns and
Geeko-homes. Gather all your fellow Geekos to the best local pizzeria and let the party
begin!

**HowTo**

So, the first GPM: Geeko Party Maker. As you might have seen, youâ€™ve all been invited to

bit](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/09/21/opensuse-12-1-beta-delay/) but party can still be had â€“ the release will be this weekend. Of course,
instead, you can organize a launch party for 12.1 once it is out â€“ which is currently planned
the third week of November. (...)

[Wazi/Carla Schroder: Become an ImageMagick Ninja: Doing Things in Batches](http://olex.openlogic.com/wazi/2011/become-an-imagemagick-ninja-doing-things-in-batches/)


Last month we introduced [ImageMagick](http://olex.openlogic.com/packages/imagemagick), a software suite that lets you manipulate images in several interesting ways. In [that article](http://olex.openlogic.com/wazi/2011/become-an-imagemagick-ninja-resizing-and-converting-images/) we learned a lot of ways to resize images, make thumbnails, and convert image file formats. Today weâ€™re going to unleash more of the mighty ImageMagick power and learn to make drop shadows, raised buttons, and proof sheets, and generate different sizes of the same image.

As always, before you manipulate irreplaceable photos, back up your originals first! (...)

[Dmitri Popov: Open Source Photography Tools Five Quick digiKam Tricks](http://scribblesandsnaps.wordpress.com/2011/09/26/five-quick-digikam-tricks/)


Tip #1

To quickly adjust thumbnail size in the Album view, press and hold the Ctrl key, then use the mouse scroll wheel to make the thumbnails larger or smaller.

Tip #2

With the Non-Destructive editing and Versioning feature enabled, digiKam automatically hides originals and displays the latest modified versions of the photos. For example, if you process a NEF file and save it in the JPEG format, digiKam hides the original RAW file and shows only the JPEG photo. To disable this feature, choose **Settings** â†’ **Configure digiKam** â†’ **Editing Images** and make sure that the **Always show original images** option in the In main view section is enabled. To keep things tidy, you can then group the original and all its versions. To do this, select the photos you want to group, right-click on the selection, and choose **Group** â†’ **Group Selected Here**. (...)

Personally, I was never happy with only one car and usually want different ones in the garage so that I can choose the one that most closely matches my mood or the kind of driving that I need to do.

Some folks like the help and tooling of a fully integrated environment like Visual Studio. Others like the hardcore elitism of EMACS or Vi. Iâ€™m a pragmatist, I like tools that just help me get the job done. (...)

[Raymond Wooninck: Chromium browser got accepted into openSUSE:Factory](http://tittiatcoke.wordpress.com/2011/09/24/chromium-browser-got-accepted-into-opensusefactory/)


After maintaining the Chromium browser in the openSUSE Contrib repositories, the last few
weeks things got accelerated and as of this moment the Chromium browser has become officially
part of openSUSE:Factory (the future 12.1).

The first step wa taken about 3 â€“ 4 weeks ago when a separate development project was
created (network:chromium). From there onwards it was just a matter of getting the package in
the right shape for Factory and making sure that all legal and security conditions were met.
Those who are tracking the updates of Chromium in this devel repo, might have noticed that a
number of rebuilds were triggered for the 16.0.880 version of Chromium. This all had to do to
get a single spec-file that would satisfy both Factory requirements but also would be able to
build for the older distributions. At this moment this special repository offers builds for
11.3, 11.4, Factory and also for Tumbleweed.

I am quite proud on this fact and I hope that the openSUSE Chromium users will be happy
with this fact. At the moment I am preparing an update to the 16.0.891 version and hopefully
sometime beginning of next week the new snapshot will become available.

[Kai-Uwe Behrmann: Colour Correction Concepts for Monitors](http://oyranos-cms.blogspot.com/2011/09/colour-correction-concepts-for-monitors.html)


Colour management for the desktop is a long standing issue not only for Linux. The
following text will concentrate on colour correction of monitors. This means the experience,
when you switch your computer or handheld on and look on the screen.

**Why colour correct the desktop? **

People tend to compensate for quite a lot of different types of monitors. They are most
often able to adapt to one full screen and see colours as they are intended to look like.
Thats fine as long as they are concentrated on the visual event on that one display. But in
this article we want to discuss how to compensate the monitor colours to our human visual
needs in environments with various displays side by side, as is the typical situation for more
and more people today. They take pictures with mobile phones or other digital cameras and look
at them on laptops, tablets, picture frames, TV sets and printouts often side by side. Or we
look at them over the internet and want to share the same visual impression with other people.
Many people with uncorrected systems see quite a difference between various colour devices and
try to figure out how to conveniently synchronise them. Colour management should help
accomplish that task. (...)

[Jos
Poortvliet: Tumbleweed image dream](http://blog.jospoortvliet.com/2011/09/tumbleweed-image-dream.html)


At the (pretty cool) [openMind conference in Tampere,
Finland](http://www.openmind.fi/), it came up that a big advantage of [Tumbleweed](http://opensuse.org/Tumbleweed) is that it always has the latest
hardware support. Thanks to the rolling release, Tumbleweed comes with the latest Linux kernel
which plays a big part of the hardware support of a Linux distro.

If your hardware does not work properly with the 'stable' release of openSUSE (or other
distro's) trying the latest kernel can solve that. But that's hard to get on your system, even
with stuff like [the openSUSE Kernel
repositories](http://kernel.opensuse.org) because it usually requires you to first **install** something. (...)

[Bryen Yunashko: The Video
BoF](http://www.bryen.com/the-video-bof)


So, one of the Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions at the Conference that I organized was a
Video BoF.  Specifically, the BoF was meant to start coming up with storyboarding to create
some cool openSUSE promotional videos (ala commercials.)  Thereâ€™s a number of us with some
great creative ideas and varying levels of exertise in this area and we just havenâ€™t gotten
off the ground yet on how to approach some of these ideas.  For me, (relying on â€œold schoolâ€
classes I took from when I was a film major) storyboarding would have helped to define exactly
the steps we needed in order to complete and execute the ideas many of us have.

However, the general discussion quickly went in another direction, and one that I think is
equally as important and Iâ€™m glad that conversation took place as wellâ€¦ (...)

[Jos
Poortvliet: MeeGo and openSUSE - an invitation](http://blog.jospoortvliet.com/2011/09/meego-and-opensuse-invitation.html)


Yesterday a [big announcement was made](http://www.meegoexperts.com/2011/09/linux-foundation-limo-foundation-announce-project-tizen/) by Intel and Samsung. It entails another big change of
directions for Moblin/Maemo/MeeGo.

**Where to go Next**

Many people in your community [wonder where to go
now](https://meego.com/community/blogs/imad/2011/whats-next-meego). Yesterday, at a MeeGo meet in Tampere, many wondered if Intel will let the
community contribute to Tizen. Will Samsung work in the open? Intel and Linux Foundation
didn't build a great track record with MeeGo and some said they simply didn't believe in it
anymore. Many clearly care about the great community which was build over the last years and
are afraid it will break up.

Aaron Seigo spoke some wise words. He said: "don't rely on what big companies might or
might not do. Find out what YOU want and how to get there!" And indeed, community is about
making your choices together. Not depending on corporate players acting as ADHD kids in a
candy store, tasting every candy then dropping it. (...)

This week is [openSUSE hackweek](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/09/22/suse-hackweek-7-next-week/), as you might know, and we do fun stuff. A couple of people, I
was one of them, were investigating in the very promising project called [ownCloud](http://owncloud.org). We were working on a better integration in the
openSUSE desktop in upcoming releases.

Why do we like ownCloud so much?

Well, thats easy: ownCloud is a solution that is under the full control of the user and as
a result very transparent. The server, were you push your data to is owned by you. You start,
stop, erase or open it how ever you want. (...)

[The Eclipse Foundation](http://www.eclipse.org/) has issued the
[first service

in [Eclipse

7](http://www.h-online.com/news/item/Oracle-releases-Java-7-platform-1288208.html). When the developers released version 3.7 of Eclipse [at
the end of June](http://www.h-online.com/news/item/Eclipse-Indigo-expands-its-reach-1266106.html) as part of the official Indigo release train, the final version of
Java 7 wasn't available. Shortly after Oracle released the new version of Java â€“ long

of the new version. To implement this support, the organisation released a "Feature

Linux. Various rumours about the parties' future plans for MeeGo and merging of plans have

[Tizen](https://www.tizen.org/) operating system will combine components
of MeeGo and Limo with an emphasis on supporting [HTML5-based applications](https://www.tizen.org/developers) and WAC ([Wholesale Applications Community](http://www.wacapps.net/)) distribution and

[Datamation: Will Windows 8 'Secure Boot' Lessen Linux Adoption?](http://www.datamation.com/open-source/does-microsoft-hold-the-keys-to-desktop-linux-1.html)


As most PC users know by now, Microsoft has given us a glimpse into what will one day be
the Windows 8 operating system. Leaving aside the many changes in the new OS â€“ it's a major
shift from what we've previously seen from Microsoft â€“ there's an extra feature included
with Windows 8 that has [some of us concerned](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/26/uefi_linux_lock_out_row_latest/).

The new feature in question is called Secure Boot. It's designed to act as a security
tool for PC users. However, there's some concern as to whether this function will be enabled
without a clear way of disabling it should someone wish to do so.

In other words, with Secure Boot enabled, you wouldn't be able to install your favorite
Linux distro on that machine.
