We will have a service outage (expected are **30 minutes**)  this Thursday morning between 09:00 and 10:00 CET.

This means the following services will not be reachable during that time:
* [build.opensuse.org](//build.opensuse.org)
* [features.opensuse.org](//features.opensuse.org)
* [api.opensuse.org](//api.opensuse.org)

The software search on [software.opensuse.org](//software.opensuse.org) might also be affected during that time.
