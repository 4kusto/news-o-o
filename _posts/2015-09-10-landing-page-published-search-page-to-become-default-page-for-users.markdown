[![Screen Shot 2015-09-10 at 15.46.06 copy]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2015-09-10-at-15.46.06-copy.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2015-09-10-at-15.46.06-copy.png)An updated [landing page](https://www.opensuse.org) for the openSUSE Project is live and it features 18 different languages to describe the embodiment of the project.

New visitors can now easily understand the differences between the new regular release Leap and openSUSE’s rolling release Tumbleweed.

“The old landing page lacked the content and the didn’t encapsulate the openSUSE project well for those who don’t know about openSUSE,” said Cynthia Sanchez, who co-designed the page along with Zvezdana Marjanovic. “The new page clears up some confusion about the two releases. It also explains the other elements of the project.”

The landing page is designed for people who are unfamiliar with the project and who are seeking information about what makes openSUSE different from other open-source projects.

Besides highlighting the differences between the two releases, the landing page features tools developed and used by the community and explains how new users can contribute to the project.

A new search page for people already using one of the two releases will become the new default page for openSUSE users in [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/products/).

That page is located at [https://www.opensuse.org/searchPage/](https://www.opensuse.org/searchPage/). While the search page uses Google as a search engine, contributors are more than welcome to add additional search engines like DuckDuckGo or others. People can contribute to the page at [https://github.com/openSUSE/searchPage](https://github.com/openSUSE/searchPage)

Anyone who wants to contribute to the translations of either page should subscribe to the [openSUSE translation mailing list](http://lists.opensuse.org).
