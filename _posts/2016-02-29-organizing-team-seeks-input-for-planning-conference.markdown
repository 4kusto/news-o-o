![oscfinal]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/oscfinal-1-300x214.png)Planning for the openSUSE Conference in Nuremberg is moving along well.

Each day brings more progress toward having a successful conference and this year the Organizing Team for oSC16 is looking for your input to make this yearâ€™s conference one to remember.

The Organizing Team has planned a pre-conference party in Nuremberg on June 21 at the [Kater Murr](http://kater-murr.com/). More details about the pre-conference party will become available in the next few weeks.

Besides that event, there are many things to do in Nuremberg and we need your opinion about what you might be interesting in doing when the conference is not taking place. From Go Karting to beer tasting, Nuremberg offers several choices for entertainment before, during and after the event. The more information attendees share about the things they would like to do at oSC16, the Organizing Team will be better able to plan group discounts and other items for the event.

Please take the time to answer [the survey questions](http://svy.mk/21w9pS9).

Two other entertainment options not list are a [car race](http://bit.ly/24x77B9) that will take place from June 24 - 26 in Nuremberg and a [90-minute Segway tour](http://bit.ly/1QGJuf9) through the city.
