####  [openSUSE News: openSUSE Announces Third Development Milestone Evaluating systemd](https://news.opensuse.org/2010/11/11/opensuse-11-4m3/)




"Delayed by a week due to a critical bug that would have prevented testing, the openSUSE project today announces openSUSE 11.4 Milestone 3 (M3), the third of six milestone releases of what will become openSUSE 11.4. The bug, a crash in the software rasterizer of the Mesa OpenGL stack, was found by our automated test suite and the openSUSE XOrg developers swung into action so that KDE would work on systems without hardware acceleration, which includes most virtual machines.

 The new profiler is documented in detail here, and is available with Mono 2.9+ (this means: it is available if you build Mono from GIT, and will be part of the upcoming 2.10 release).   

  

 We would love to hear your feedback on it, and we hope to have a UI integrated into MonoDevelop soon. (...)" 




####  [Miguel de Icaza: F# Goes Open Source](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Nov-11.html)




"Last week, Don Syme announced that Microsoft has open sourced the F# compiler and the F# core libraries under the Apache 2 license.   

  

 In addition, on Tuesday, Don also announced a new release that fixes a handful of bugs specifically for users targeting Mono.   

  

 F# is a fascinating language, but I had not really spent much time with it as we could not really distribute it as an open source compiler limiting its usefulness in the Linux and Mac worlds. Now F# can become just another language that developers can use.   

  

 F# supports asynchronous programming today, and it was the inspiration for C# 5.0's async support. There is no need to wait for C# 5 to come out, you can start using async workflows today with F# everywhere. (...)"

 to the following repo  

[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/languages:/python/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/languages:/python/)" 




####  [#310801 Jargon File package](https://features.opensuse.org/310801)




"Use [The Jargon File sources](http://www.catb.org/jargon/download.html) to create a Jargon File package for openSUSE. Originally intended to solve [Bug #651899](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=651899)." 




####  [#310802 Hardware TestSuite + S.M.O.L.T Windows client](https://features.opensuse.org/310802)




"Windows users always complain, there's no hardware compatybility on Linux. They even won't test LiveCD. LiveCD don't always can show full hardware support, like restricted drivers in action. (...)" 




####  [#310803 Compatibility package](https://features.opensuse.org/310803)




"The idea is to avoid incompatybility without stop distribution changes. We can change everythink, what we need, and after few months releases compatybility package, which installs library & other compatybility layers to software distributed on internal media(or outside a repository). (...)" 




####  [#310804 Include Unity as alternative GNOME GUI](https://features.opensuse.org/310804)




"Canonical introduced "Unity" with Ubuntu 10.10 as netbook GUI and plans to extend it for desktop use.  

 As Unity is FOSS (GPLv3), Unity can be made available as alternative GUI." 




####  [#310808 multi-arch RHEL/Fedora support](https://features.opensuse.org/310808)




"When using x86_64 arch it's impossible to pull in the glibc-devel.i386 package which is needed to build gcc, llvm, path64 and any other compiler or various packages." 




####  [#310809 system repair from 11.2](https://features.opensuse.org/310809)




"In OpenSuse 11.2 was installation option Repair. It helped often repair system and (more important!) repair Grub. In 11.3 there is no repair option. It is very important for users who use for example Windows XP and Suse, because after XP installation, Suse disappears and they don't have easy sollution to repair Grub. I'm a member of Polish Suse forum and we can see how often new people are give up to learn Linux because of missing easy solution at the beginning of using/installing system." 




####  [#310811 Enable touchpad "tap click" by default](https://features.opensuse.org/310811)




"It seems in SUSE 11.3 the default setting was changed so that the touchpad no longer accepts tapping to click. At first I thought I had a driver issue or something was messed up. (...)" 




####  [#310819 Install Grub to MBR by default](https://features.opensuse.org/310819)




"When installing openSUSE 11.3, right before copying the files to disk, one gets to choose where to install Grub - on a partition or in MBR. Installing on a partition is the default. (...)" 




####  [#310825 QTads in OpenSuSE Repository](https://features.opensuse.org/310825)




"[QTads](http://qtads.sourceforge.net/) is the only Linux program currently capable of running the full/multimedia version of [interactive fiction](http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Main_Page) games written in the [TADS (Text Adventure Development System)](http://www.tads.org/tads.htm) code (see "why do we want this" reason for more info). At the moment, it's not available in any OpenSuSE repository, including the 3rd party Webpin-accessible or Build Service user home projects. Linux binaries are technically available but they're built off Debian Lenny and have enough version-specific dependencies for having it be in a repository strongly preferable, particularly for GNOME users and/or novices.

"It has been some time since I wrote for the News. During the period between the release of 11.3 and the start of Milestone releases for 11.4, the Testing Core Team was essentially inactive - at least as a group. When M3 was released, I was away from home and missed an IRC meeting. From the transcript, I learned that the Xorg crashes made the system essentially unusable. That bug also delayed the release of M3 for almost a week, but it is now available.  

  

 The Testing Core Team will have an IRC meeting on November 15 at 17:00 UTC.  

 See [http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Testing_meeting](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Testing_meeting) for details. Anyone that wishes may join us.  

  

 Next week I will cover the above meeting."

####  [Sirko Kemter: openSUSE A-Z Guide at BLIT 2010](http://karl-tux-stadt.de/ktuxs/?p=2860)




"Yesterday I was in Potsdam at Brandenburger Linux-Infotag, it was my 7th visit at this event. Its one of the smaller events in Germany. They started with the event in the city Brandenburg and moved 3 years ago to Potsdam at the university there, since then the event grows up a little bit.  

  

 This year they had a bigger program with workshops, 3 tracks and 3 tracks with talks.  

  

 For me it was as I said my 7th visit and I had every year a talk or/and a workshop there. This year I had a talk The openSUSE A-Z guide there and of course an workshop about Inkscape. For my talk the worst case scenario did happen. I prepared my talk and put him on an usb stick, the stick crashed. I can be lucky that Pavol load up a older version of them to prezi, so I had some slides to show."

"Had a great time with the Madison Linux User Group Saturday. About a dozen folks skipped the second half of the Badger game (and a really nice fall day), and joined us at ITT Technical Institute for my Introduction to openSUSE presentation.  

  

 As most folks there use Ubuntu, I focused on the things that make openSUSE stand out, which was mainly YaST (the installer and system administration tool). I also spent a great deal of time showing off KDE SC 4.5”actually more time than I wanted to, as I managed to hang up my system! (...)"

 In part, this is because Postfix can be set up in a number of ways. Some installations use Postfix alone, others use Postfix in conjunction with other apps and store user information in MySQL. You can have users who have actual accounts on a system, or you can have users on virtual domains that don't have a login but still receive mail. Or you might want aliases that include several users, so everybody on the "marketing" list gets mail or all folks in sales, legal or development can receive messages."

####  [Holger Hetterich: SMB Traffic Analyzer 1.1 released](http://holger123.wordpress.com/2010/11/07/smb-traffic-analyzer-1-1-released/)




"The team just released SMB Traffic Analyzer version 1.1. Among many uncounted small fixes and updates, this release features the following:  

  

 The configuration file support in smbtad was incomplete, it did not support all available options. The 1.1 code fixes this (bnc#651800). The resolving of this bug was a requirement to enable LSB compatible start / stop scripts for smbtad (bnc#651112). Therefore, you can now control smbtad with the rcsmbtad script, and currently it allows rcsmbtad start, rcsmbtad stop, and rcsmbtad status. This also brings us a step closer to build appliances for SMB Traffic Analyzer. And then we had a compile issue with distributions that include older versions of talloc. The 1.1 code fixes this by providing a missing define should it not exist (bnc#649840) to the smbtad and the smbtatools packages. Therefore we can announce two more distributions to be supported by SMB Traffic Analyzer, that is openSUSE 11.1, and SLES11-SP1 (as well as SLES11). Just check the download page which has been updated with one-click install links for these distributions! Finally we have updated the documentation (bnc#651823) to reflect the configuration news for smbtad and its control through the rcsmbtad script. (...)"

 The Ovi and KDE sprint took place at Nokia™s Münich office, where we discussed why integration between KDE and Ovi would be beneficial for both (better user experience, exposure to a large userbase). There I had the pleasure to meet lots of KDE people; Leinir, Frank Karlitschek, Chani, Myriam Schweingruber, Sascha Peilicke, Sivan Greenberg, Mark Kretschmann, Rune Jensen, Arjen Hiemstra, Jonathan, Dinesh, Krzysiek, Knut Yrvin¦   

 After the Ovi sprint, the Qt Developer Days 2010 began. The training sessions took place the first day. Even though some exercises were skipped, I liked it. Days 2 and 3 were focused on showing how cool Qt is. I never thought QML could be that easy, powerful and straightforward. Besides all of the presentations, we also had dinner with the Trolls, played the fact or crap game and tried some Meego-powered devices.

"The interwebs are full this morning of reports on Mark Shuttleworth™s announcement that someday he™d like to use Wayland instead of Xorg as Ubuntu™s primary display driver.   

  

 My favorite so far is Ryan Paul™s Ars Technica article for this dead-on estimate of the amount of effort it would take to completely replace X11: 




<blockquote>Although the Linux ecosystem would benefit greatly from a lighter and more easily extensible alternative, a concerted effort to displace X11 on the Linux desktop hasn™t really emerged yet because the task of bringing drivers, third-party software, and all of the other layers of the stack into alignment with such a move would be prohibitively cumbersome.

 Typically, the articles are a mixture of demands for hardware support or new software and rejections of the way that the Linux community operates.
