openSUSE 12.1 was launched on Wednesday and it's time to look back at the successful launch of a great distribution.

We've seen a lot of positive feedback regarding openSUSE 12.1 via [press](http://en.opensuse.org/In_the_press), social networks, blogs etc. The interest in social media is significant with good conversations and new members, our [facebook group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2256834487) has grown the last weeks by several hundred new members, the followers of our [@openSUSE twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/openSUSE) increase and the recently launchedÂ [ Google+ page ](https://plus.google.com/110312141834246266844/)is in the circles of over 3200 people.

Looking over twitter messages directed to our[ @openSUSE](http://twitter.com/openSUSE) account, here're just a few comments about openSUSE 12.1:

## Download of openSUSE 12.1


As usual, our download server redirected all incoming traffic to our mirror network. The mirrors reported that we again saturated their connections for a couple of hours after the announcement, e.g.


<blockquote>ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de did up to 4.5 GBit/sec for openSUSE just with HTTP.Â  BitTorrent did 300-800 MBit/sec during the whole time. Total traffic spanning all projects peaked at 5.02 GBit/sec with a daily average of 2.44 GBit/sec.</blockquote>


Our download redirector countedÂ  for the first 24 hoursÂ  the download of 93761 media, the distribution over the various types is:



	
  * NonOss Addon CD BiArch:Â  1452

	
  * 32-bit x86: 48075 (total)

	
    * Net: 2489

	
    * DVD: 31840

	
    * GNOME-LiveCD: 7392

	
    * KDE-LiveCD: 5561

	
    * Addon-Lang: 793




	
  * 64-bit x86-64:Â  44234 (total)

	
    * Net: 2444

	
    * DVD: 32927

	
    * GNOME-LiveCD: 4031

	
    * KDE-LiveCD: 4378

	
    * Addon-Lang: 454





Also bittorrent was in high demand, at one point we had 1387 seeders and 2804 leechers but we missed to track the high point.Â  The tracker counted 12924 complete downloads via bittorrent during the first 24 hours.


## Physical Media


We're producing now PromoDVDs to distribute at events and via the openSUSE ambassadors, a separate announcement on how to get this will
come once we have the media. A couple of magazines are doing covermounts as well, e.g. Linux Pro Magazine and Linux Magazine will insert it into their worldwide newsstand subscription distribution.

Also, Open Source Press is producing a German openSUSE 12.1 box which is available soon ([details](http://en.opensuse.org/Buy_openSUSE )), this retail edition is a version of openSUSE with a complete printed  end-user manual, installation media, lot's of vouchers and more.


## Webpages and Infrastructure


Thanks to our translators, we updated the [frontpage](http://www.opensuse.org/) with localized announcements and even added some new languages for our front page like [Polish](http://www.opensuse.org/pl), [Lithuian](http://www.opensuse.org/lt) and [Thai](http://www.opensuse.org/th).

The infrastructure itself has seen increased traffic due to the launch where many where interested in the new [openSUSE 12.1 portal page](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:12.1 ).

## Thank you


The openSUSE launchÂ  was possible thanks to a world wide infrastructure of ftp mirrors that coordinated the release with us. We™d like to thank all of them. Moreover, we™d like to thank everybodyÂ  to make the changes to the websites so users could download their brand new openSUSE 12.1 and find information about it! We™d also like to thank the marketing team and anyone who helped for their awesome work (check out the [Product Highlights](http://en.opensuse.org/Product_highlights) if you haven™t yet!) and of course all contributors of openSUSE who helped to make this release possible!
