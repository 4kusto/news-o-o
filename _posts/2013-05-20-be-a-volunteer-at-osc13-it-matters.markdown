Master oSC13 Kostas just published his ["only 58 days to go"](http://e-tote-kala.blogspot.com/2013/05/organizing-osc13-58-days-before.html) blog in his series of daily _how are we doing_ posts and it should be clear that with less than two months to go, we're getting close! openSUSE conference 2013 is already just around the corner... And starting today, you can sign up to volunteer and help out at the venue!


## Join the Team


Many people are already helping with the organization in [trello.com/osc13](https://trello.com/osc13) - if you have not seen where we are yet, just follow the link and check it out! We want to organize our event as openly as possible, and Trello is a great way of doing that.

But there is more than preparation. We also need an 'army on the ground': the people who make it happen on the conference days! If you want to get more involved and help out during the conference days, you can apply to be a volunteer for oSC13 by filling out the form at [http://bit.ly/10s5HDJ](http://bit.ly/10s5HDJ). We need you!


## Training


One important thing to have in mind is that ALL Volunteers must attend the Volunteers Training, which means that you have to be at the venue on the 18th of July at noon. This year the training of the volunteers will be something you have never seen before. Beyond the regular volunteer training you will be able to get some basic knowledge on First Aid and how to react on-site in case of emergency or disaster (such as a fire or an earthquake). All the training will be conducted by professionals. Our purpose is for volunteers to acquire knowledge that can be used basically everywhere.

## About oSC13


As a quick refresher of your memory, this year [the openSUSE Conference](http://conference.opensuse.org) takes place in the beautiful city of Thessaloniki, Greece. The _to-be-awesome_ event is organized by our _Greekos_, an elite team of Greek contributors to openSUSE.

The event is shaping up to be a _one-of-a-kind_, bringing together [the beautiful beaches](https://www.google.com/search?q=thessaloniki+beach&tbm=isch) with the [incredible history of Greece](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_philosophy) in one inspiring place. And **you can be a part of it!**
