[![This time for real](http://www.worldipv6launch.org/wp-content/themes/ipv6/downloads/World_IPv6_launch_banner_256.png)](http://www.worldipv6launch.org/)Like last year, openSUSE will participate again on the coordinated launch of the next-generation Internet protocol IPv6 on June 6, 2012.

Joining the [Internet Society](http://www.isoc.org/) and several major Internet companies like [Google](http://googleblog.blogspot.de/2012/01/ipv6-countdown-to-launch.html), [Yahoo](http://www.yahoo.com) and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com), openSUSE shows again its readiness for the industry-standard technologies including the new standard protocol for the Internet, Internet Protocol version 6 (also known as IPv6).

As we started already last year and did not disable the services since then, this time is an easy win for us: all our services, including [wiki](http://en.opensuse.org/Main_Page), [news](https://news.opensuse.org),Â  [documentation](http://doc.opensuse.org), [forums](http://forums.opensuse.org/) and of course [OBS](http://build.opensuse.org) are already reachable via IPv6 **and** IPv4. Several thousand users have been using our services via IPv6 every day since then.Â  This year, the [openSUSE-Education](http://ipv6.opensuse-education.org) project also joins us and provides their major services also via IPv6.

So no time to hide any more: try it out and become part of the next generation Internet Protocol users around the world! Your preferred Operating System already supports IPv6 since years now - and a lot of websites and other [participants](www.worldipv6launch.org/participants/), too.
