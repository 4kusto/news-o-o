![](/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/release-is-coming-black.png)The release of [openSUSE Leap 15.1](//en.opensuse.org/Portal:15.1) is about three weeks away. To help spread the word about the release, we have counters available at [counter.opensuse.org](https://counter.opensuse.org) and more artwork on [https://github.com/openSUSE/artwork](https://github.com/openSUSE/artwork)/. You can put these items on your social media or blog pages to make sure everybody knows that the Release is Coming!


## For you blog and social media accounts


If you want to decorate your blog or website with a nice Leap 15.1 banner, grab one of these:
<table cellpadding="4" width="100%" cellspacing="0" > 
<tbody >
<tr valign="TOP" >

<td width="84%" >![](/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/small.png)
</td>

<td width="16%" >[130x130](https://countdown.opensuse.org/small)
</td>
</tr>

### Release Counter


[![](//counter.opensuse.org/small.png)](//en.opensuse.org/Portal:13.1)You can add the openSUSE 15.1 release counter to your website in various sizes by including the following html code in your blog:
`<a href="//en.opensuse.org/Portal:15.1"><img src="//counter.opensuse.org/**medium**.png" border="0"/></a><br/>`
"medium" is the size of the counter; it can also be "small" or "large" and we also have "wide" for a banner.

See [the Countdown page on the openSUSE Wiki](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Countdown) for more countdown information, code and tips!
