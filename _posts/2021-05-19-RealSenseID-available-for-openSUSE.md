While focused on the [openSUSE Innovator initiative](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:INNOVATORS) as an openSUSE member and official [Intel oneAPI](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi.html) innovator, I tested the OAK AI Kit device on openSUSE [Leap 15.1, 15.2, 15.3 RC](https://software.opensuse.org/distributions/leap) and [Tumbleweed](https://software.opensuse.org/distributions/tumbleweed). With all the work, we made available in the SDB an article on how to install this device on the openSUSE platform. More information can be found at <https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Install_RealSenseID>.

[Intel RealSense ID](https://www.intelrealsense.com/facial-authentication/) combines an active depth sensor with a specialized neural network designed to deliver an intuitive, secure and accurate facial authentication solution that adapts over time. This solution offers user privacy and is activated by user awareness. Built-in anti spoofing technology protects against attacks using photographs, videos or masks.

Intel RealSense ID is a natural solution simplifying secure entry for everyone, everywhere. Supports children to tall adults and designed for Smart Locks, Access Control, PoS, ATMs, and Kiosks in openSUSE (of course).
