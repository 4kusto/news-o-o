I'm glad to announce that I have given over my responsibilities for the openSUSE distribution to Stephan Kulow <coolo@suse.de>. As from now on Stephan is project manager for the openSUSE distribution.

Stephan - known also as Coolo - the "born release dude", has been with Novell/SUSE for five years. Before that he worked on Linux distributions at Caldera.Â  His wide experience in Linux includes the dinosaurs (called s390), desktop technology (KDE), several build systems (including his own at Caldera), and SUSE tools like package translation.

Stephan's first challenge will be the release of openSUSE 10.3 Alpha6 and I fear I've left him some nuts to crack.Â  Having worked with Stephan for many years, we can expect nothing but an excellent openSUSE 10.3
release. ;-)

Btw. in my new function as Director of Platform and openSUSE, I'll stay involved with openSUSE.
