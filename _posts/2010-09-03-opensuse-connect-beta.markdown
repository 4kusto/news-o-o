As a result of the openSUSE Boosters' '[HackMeck](http://news.opensuse.org/2010/08/09/opensuse-connect-hacking-session-at-froscon-2010/)' two weeks ago at FrOSCoN we are proud to present you with a new beta of openSUSE Connect.

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/connect.jpg)](http://elgg.org)Connect is supposed to become the central user database for the openSUSE project. Sounds bland, don''t it? But you know the Boosters, everything we do comes with a grain of spice and Connect is no different. The spice here are a lot of nifty social network features like user profiles, friending, groups, an event calendar and possibly more. Thats possible because on top of the user database we use a Free Software social network framework called [Elgg](http://elgg.org). Elgg will help us to go a step further in one of the most important areas of the openSUSE project: Connecting our community. We do a very good job connecting code at the moment but there is no central place for openSUSE users to mingle, form relationships and meet collaborators.


## Try it!


Did we whet your appetite? Want to try it? No problem, just head over to our beta instance [http://connect.opensuse.org ](http://connect.opensuse.org)and login as user _geeko_ with the password _opensuse_ to try it out. Make some friends, create a group or run a poll. This instance is regularly deployed with the newest code from our git repository so you will always get the latest and greatest. But please don't forget that this is a beta :-) If you encounter any problems, guess what, make a bugreport in [our bugzilla](https://bugzilla.novell.com/enter_bug.cgi?classification=7340&product=openSUSE.org&submit=Use+This+Product&component=Connect)!


## Help out!


[![](/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/elgg.png)](http://elgg.org) Or how about you get your hands dirty? So far our experience with Elgg is wonderful. It's a tidy, extensible and well designed piece of software. The community is very helpful and there is a lot (if not to say a butt-load) of functionality available. And if something is not there already we have found that we can easily add it. **You** could too you know? Elgg runs on a combination of Apache, MySQL and the PHP scripting language and as this is the most  popular web server environment in the world we hope we can attract more people to help to fit Elgg to openSUSE's needs. And on top of that it's really easy to hack on it! The changes we did so far at the [HackMeck](http://news.opensuse.org/2010/08/09/opensuse-connect-hacking-session-at-froscon-2010/) and the last couple of weeks are self-contained in plugins that extend the basic functionality. The powerful data model and view system of Elgg make it possible to change it to openSUSE's needs without ever touching the core functions. So if you are interested in helping,Â [get to know Elgg](http://docs.elgg.org/wiki/Getting_Started_With_Development) and then get in contact with the [openSUSE Boosters.](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Boosters_team)

We hope you will enjoy this new openSUSE tool. And remember: **Have a lot of fun...**
