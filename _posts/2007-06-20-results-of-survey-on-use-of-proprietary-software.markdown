The results of the survey we did on proprietary software [has been published](http://en.opensuse.org/UX#Surveys): It shows that we ship on the media some software which is hardly used (e.g. PlanMaker, SEPsesam etc.). Software which is hardly used we don't need to ship on our media. Therefor the suggestion is to drop some software totally and offer some software only via ftp. To be discussed on opensuse-project.
