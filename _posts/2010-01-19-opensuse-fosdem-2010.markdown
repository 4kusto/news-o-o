It is that time of the year again!


[![FOSDEM, the Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting](http://www.fosdem.org/promo/fosdem/square)](http://www.fosdem.org)



[FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org/2010/) will take place at the first weekend in February (6th/7th) in Brussels and we're going to attend. There is a buttload of tracks, devrooms and lightning talks to visit. Including, but not limited to: Security, Scalability, Monitoring, Distributions, KDE, GNOME, Ruby on Rails, X.org, LiMux, csync, GeeXboX and so on and so on. You should check the [Schedule.](http://fosdem.org/2010/schedule/tracks) Of course also the famous exhibition exhaust pipe hallway will be back once more with project [booths](http://fosdem.org/2010/stands) ranging from CAcert to Zarafa Community.

Our project will attend mostly in the individual project's [devrooms](http://fosdem.org/2010/schedule/devrooms) and together with CentOS, Debian, Fedora and Mandriva in the [distribution mini-conference](http://fosdem.org/2010/schedule/devrooms/distributions) that will happen. OfÂ  course we also have a booth to show off and hand out promo DVD''s of the greatest distribution on this planet. We hope you seize this opportunity to meet, learn from, get inspired by and shape the community that will gather at the the best Free Software and Open Source event in Europe!
