The openSUSE Project is looking for a few good mentors for the [Google Summer of Code ](http://code.google.com/soc/)2009! The openSUSE Project was a mentoring organization last year, and we're hoping to participate again in 2009. Organization signup [starts next week](http://code.google.com/opensource/gsoc/2009/faqs.html#0_1_timeline_5354032302481437_), and prospective mentors can sign up next week as well.

Signup [starts March 9th](http://en.opensuse.org/Summer_of_Code_2009#Important_dates) at 19:00 UTC/12:00 PST and ends March 13th at 19:00 UTC/12:00 PST. Accepted organizations will be announced on March 18th, and there's a week (March 18 through 23) for organizations and students to meet and discuss.

The student application period begins March 23rd, and ends April 3rd. All of the dates are on the Google SoC FAQ and we'll be sending out announcements as each of the important dates approach.

Right now, we're gathering ideas for the Summer of Code [on the openSUSE wiki](http://en.opensuse.org/Summer_of_Code_2009#Ideas). (Thanks to [Lukas Ocilka, Stanislav Visnovsky, and Jiri Srain](http://kobliha-suse.blogspot.com/2009/03/google-summer-of-code-2009-opensuse-is.html) for starting this!) Feel free to add your own ideas or help revise the existing ideas.

Also, if you're interested in helping out, please [add your name](http://en.opensuse.org/Summer_of_Code_2009#Organization) to the openSUSE GSoC '09 page.

In addition to mentors (and students...) we'll need help finding mentors, reviewing GSoC applications, facilitating communication during GSoC, and so forth. (Again, see the wiki!)

If you have questions about openSUSE and GSoC, ask on the opensuse-project list. Sadly these expectations can get [https://justbuyessay.com/](https://justbuyessay.com/) tarnished by a drop of pace in the c9020-560 ibm certified specialist exam pdf questions training
