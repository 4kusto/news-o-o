The openSUSE Project is proud to announce the release of openSUSE 11.0 -- everything you need to get started with Linux on the desktop and on the server. Promoting the use of Linux everywhere, the openSUSE Project provides free, easy access to the world's most usable Linux distribution, openSUSE.

The 11.0 release of openSUSE includes more than [200 new features](//en.opensuse.org/Testing:Features_11.0) specific to openSUSE, a [redesigned installer](//news.opensuse.org/2008/06/05/sneak-peeks-at-opensuse-110-new-installer-with-stephan-kulow/) that makes openSUSE even easier to install, faster package management thanks to [major updates in the ZYpp stack](//news.opensuse.org/2008/06/06/sneak-peeks-at-opensuse-110-package-management-with-duncan-mac-vicar/), and [KDE 4](//news.opensuse.org/2008/06/17/sneak-peeks-at-opensuse-110-kde-with-stephan-binner/), [GNOME 2.22](//news.opensuse.org/2008/06/18/sneak-peeks-at-opensuse-110-talking-gnome-with-vincent-untz/), [Compiz Fusion](//news.opensuse.org/2008/06/07/sneak-peeks-at-opensuse-110-compiz-with-dennis-kasprzyk/), and [much more](//news.opensuse.org/2008/06/19/sneak-peeks-at-opensuse-110-a-plethora-of-improvements/).



## On the Desktop




* * *

Whether you use GNOME or KDE, the openSUSE 11.0 desktop is a beautiful experience. Users have the choice of GNOME 2.22, KDE 4, KDE 3.5, Xfce, and more! See the [screenshot page](//en.opensuse.org/Screenshots/openSUSE_11.0) for a in-depth look at the openSUSE desktop.



### GNOME 2.22


GNOME users will find a lot to like in openSUSE 11.0. openSUSE's GNOME is very close to upstream GNOME, because Novell and openSUSE want to do as much work as possible in the upstream release. However, we do modify GNOME's artwork to provide a unified look and feel for the distro. The default GNOME configuration, such as panel layout, is slightly different than "stock" GNOME, and the openSUSE GNOME team backports a number of bug fixes into our GNOME release to ensure stability and the best possible GNOME experience.

GNOME 2.22 in openSUSE 11.0 includes the GNOME Virtual File System (GVFS), with better support for networked file systems, PulseAudio for better sound management, improvements in Evolution and Tomboy, and [much more](//news.opensuse.org/2008/06/18/sneak-peeks-at-opensuse-110-talking-gnome-with-vincent-untz/)!


### KDE 4.0


openSUSE 11.0 is the first openSUSE release to include a stable release of KDE 4.0. This release includes sweeping changes in the KDE desktop, and represents the next generation of KDE. This release includes a new desktop shell, called Plasma, a new look and feel (called Oxygen), and many interface and usability improvements.

KControl has been replaced with Systemsettings, which makes system configuration much easier. KDE's window manager, KWin, now supports 3-D desktop effects.

KDE 4.0 doesn't include KDEPIM applications, so the openSUSE team has included beta versions of the KDEPIM suite (KMail, KOrganizer, Akregator, etc.) from the KDE 4.1 branch that's in development and scheduled to be released in July and for online update.

Note that KDE 3.5 is still available on the openSUSE DVD for KDE users who aren't quite ready to make the leap to KDE 4.

### Compiz Fusion


The openSUSE desktop is not only a green glorious sight to behold, it's also available in 3-D! Compiz Fusion is now the default in openSUSE 11.0. You'll find a slew of interesting Compiz plugins, as well as easier configuration with Simple CompizConfig Settings Manager (CCSM) and the more comprehensive CompizConfig Settings Manager that allows detailed configuration of your Compiz setup. See the [Sneak Peek](//news.opensuse.org/2008/06/07/sneak-peeks-at-opensuse-110-compiz-with-dennis-kasprzyk/) for a detailed look at Compiz Fusion on openSUSE 11.0.

### Firefox 3.0


Firefox is one of the most popular open source applications on the planet, and the openSUSE desktop just wouldn't be complete without Mozilla Firefox. The 3.0 release has a number of new features and improvements that will make browsing the Web on openSUSE convenient and safe, including better site identification features, simplified add-on installation and management, detection of "phishing" sites, the ability to save tabs on exit, better download manager, and a new page zoom feature that lets you zoom text or the entire page.

Note that openSUSE 11.0 ships with Firefox 3.0 beta 5, and updates to the final 3.0 release will be available through online update.

### Banshee 1.0


openSUSE 11.0 includes Banshee 1.0. The Banshee media player has been re-written to improve performance and includes many new features, including video playback, better "shuffle" playback, support for iPods, MTP devices, and mass storage player devices, and support for podcasts and better Last.fm integration.

### OpenOffice.org 2.4


You can work hard and play hard with openSUSE. If you need a high-quality office suite that's Microsoft Office compatible, look no further than [Novell's OpenOffice.org](//go-oo.org/discover/) 2.4. This release includes import support for OpenXML, 3-D transitions in Impress, SVG import support, improved performance over standard OpenOffice.org, and better Excel support and VBA macro support.


### NetworkManager 0.7


NetworkManager has been vastly improved since 10.3, and now includes support for multiple network interfaces and UTMS and EV-DO cards.

  * Linux kernel 2.6.25
