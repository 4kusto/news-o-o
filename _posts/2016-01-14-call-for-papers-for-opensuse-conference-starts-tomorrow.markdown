![openSUSE Conference Crowd](/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/CSC_0177.jpg)openSUSE is pleased to announce a call for papers for the openSUSE Conference 2016 (oSC16) taking place in Nuremberg, Germany.

The dates for submission will be Jan. 15 through April 15. The 90-day plus period is plenty of time to submit a proposal, but don’t wait until the late minute.

**Presentations can be submitted in one of the following formats**



	
  * Lightning Talks (10 mins)

	
  * Short Talk (30 mins)

	
  * Long Talk (60 mins)

	
  * Workshop (3 hours)


There are tracks listed for the conference. While these tracks might be refined, people should submit proposals even if they don’t think it fits into one of the tracks.

A Program Committee will evaluate the proposals based on the submitted abstracts and the accepted proposals will be announced no later than May 15.

There is also a few summits combined with this years conference schedule that will interest several open-source users, developers, sysadmins and users.

There will be an Own Cloud Summit, Kolab Summit, Kernel Summit (by SUSE Labs) and Salt Stack Summit during the four-day event.

Volunteers who would like to participate on the Program Committee or the Organizing Team for the conference should email [ddemaio@suse.de](mailto:ddemaio@suse.de).
