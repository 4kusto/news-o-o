I really love Hackfests, having fun, working on what we love and what comes out of the work we are doing, makes peoples lives easier. There are some people who really need certain technologies more than we need faster Browsers or a better office suite that is why GNOME accessibility contributors will be gathering once again in A Coruna in Spain next week for a four day [Hackfest](https://live.gnome.org/Hackfests/ATK2011) from 18 to 22 of January. They will gather to work on enhancing GNOME assistive technologies that allow people with disabilities such as visual, movement, hearing, cognitive and language impairments to use GNOME software. Almost a year ago, from May 9th to 13th the team had their first Hackfest and a lot of work was made there but even more needs to be done. They have a really big list of tasks so even if you can't make it to this Hackfest but still want to help you can see the[ GNOME Accessibility page](http://projects.gnome.org/accessibility/), join their [mailing list](gnome-accessibility-list@gnome.org), the wiki pages or take a llok in their [Roadmap](https://live.gnome.org/Accessibility/Roadmap).
As they mention in the announcement, this Hackfest will be focusing in ATK and AT-SPI that are the two key GNOME accessibility technologies.These facilities allow GNOME applications to be used through accessibility technologies, such as screen readers.





### What are the needs and who should attend?


Applications and tool kits do not all implement ATK consistently. This has a negative impact on the assistiveÂ technologies' ability to provide a consistent cross-application user experience. Even in applications and tool kits in which the ATK implementation is complete, the information obtained from a single event and/or object is not always sufficient for an AT client to proceed immediately; instead it is often necessary to perform further queries and make decisions based on heuristics rather than concrete data. The tasks of this Hackfest need people who have the following skills:



	
  * Developers of applications and tool kits which implement ATK

	
  * Developers of ATK and AT-SPI

	
  * Developers of Assistive Technologies which rely upon AT-SPI

	
  * Developers of testing solutions which rely upon AT-SPI


For more information take a look to the [Hackfest page](https://live.gnome.org/Hackfests/ATK2011) from where most of the above information was extracted. If you are interested to help and if you are around A Coruna those days,you have some spare time and you are a hacker full-filling any of the above skills, you have no excuses now :) The hackfest is being hosted once again by Igalia who, alongside the GNOME Foundation, are sponsoring the hackfest. Everybody has the freedom to use Linux, especially the people who know how it is to miss some of the simple things in life like reading a book,see a movie or listen to a song, work on making the life of those special people easier is one of the Nobler things someone can do and proves the ethos of the FLOSS communities.
