Alpha releases of [openSUSE Leap 15.4](https://get.opensuse.org/testing) are now available for download on [get.opensuse.org](https://get.opensuse.org). The fourth minor release of Leap 15 has entered its alpha development stage.

During the Alpha phase, regular Alpha images will be built on a rolling basis until mid-February when the point release is scheduled to transition to a Beta build phase. The beta submission deadline is February 16, according to the [roadmap](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Roadmap). The Beta phase has a similar model until the General Availability of the release. The rolling builds stop after the Beta phase is complete and Leap transitions into a maintenance and security update phase upon beoming public available.

Distro hoppers, hobbyists, users and tech enthusiasts are encouraged to download the current builds and help test the releases to make sure bugs are taking care of in the alpha and beta phases. People interested in testing it to make sure things are working can click on the ["Learn more‚Äù](https://get.opensuse.org/testing) button to find the downloads. 

The Public Availability of Leap 15.4 is scheduled to be released in June, 2022, according to the release's [roadmap](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Roadmap). Users of Leap 15.3 will need to update to the newest version within six months of the Public Availability of Leap 15.4.

Users of openSUSE Leap 15.2 should update this month before it reaches its End of Live; users should update to Leap 15.3 if they have not already done so to make sure they continue to receive maintenance and security updates.
