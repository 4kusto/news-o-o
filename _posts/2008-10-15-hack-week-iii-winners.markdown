After _very_ careful deliberation, we've chosen the winners from [Hack Week III](https://news.opensuse.org/2008/08/07/announcing-hack-week-iii/). The categories were: Best Cross-Pollination Team, First Penguin Awards, and the Best Overall Projects.

**The Best Cross-Pollination Team**: Awards the project that connects different teams, and raises awareness of each other's work.

**First Penguin Award**: Awards the project that goes out on a limb to try something difficult and risky... and probably fails.Â  Named in honor of the first penguin to jump into the water when there may be predators swimming below.

**Best Overall Projects**: Goes to the projects that the panelists thought were best for one reason or other. Surprisingly enough, we had a tie for first place on this one!

And the winners are:

The judges for Hack Week III were: Brady Anderson, Joe 'Zonker' Brockmeier, Olaf Kirch, Lars Marowsky-BrÃ©e, Hendrik Vogelsang, and Andrew Wafaa. Thanks for their time and effort judging the entries.

Thanks also to everyone who participated in Hack Week. We had a lot of great ideas and work come out of Hack Week and we learned a lot about getting the openSUSE community outside of Novell involved in Hack Week.

At this time, we're planning another Hack Week in the spring 2009 time frame. More details will be announced then. Have suggestions for future Hack Weeks?
