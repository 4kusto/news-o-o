### Membership Drive Still Underway


The [Elections Committee](mailto:election-officials@opensuse.org) would like to remind all [openSUSE Contributors](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:How_to_participate) that a healthy [Project](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Project) is only possible if it has a robust roster of [Members](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Members), and it is especially important for the Elections process.  Applications for openSUSE Membership are accepted and processed on an ongoing basis, but a Membership Drive has been declared by the Elections Officials in an effort to get as many qualified Project Contributors to take part in the voting process, which is scheduled to begin February 4, 2019, and run for 12 days with ballots closing February 15.

**All openSUSE Contributors and Members** are requested to actively urge other Contributors who are not Members to get their Membership and get out and vote.  All Members who have been approved by the [Membership Committee](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Membership_officials) before the start of balloting February 4 will be eligible to vote in this election.

You can apply for openSUSE Membership by following the [instructions here](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Members).
