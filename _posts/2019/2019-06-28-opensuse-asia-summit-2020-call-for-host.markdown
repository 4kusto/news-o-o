![](/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screenshot-from-2019-06-28-09-58-35.png)The openSUSE.Asia Summit is the largest annual openSUSE conference in Asia, attended by contributors and enthusiasts from all over Asia. The event focuses primarily on the openSUSE distribution, its applications for personal and enterprise use, and open source culture. It brings together the openSUSE community in Asia, providing a forum for users, developers, foundation leaders, governments and businesses to discuss the present technology and future developments.

The Summit’s preference is to find new locations each year as we spread openSUSE throughout Asia, and we are looking for local organizers to rise to the challenge of organizing an excellent openSUSE event in 2020. We need individuals and communities to get together and organize a successful openSUSE.Asia Summit. The openSUSE.Asia organization committee assists throughout the process.


### **Proposals for openSUSE.Asia Summit 2020**


For those of you who are interested in hosting the next openSUSE.Asia Summit, you are invited to submit a formal proposal to the openSUSE.Asia organization committee and join this year summit. The deadlines for the proposals are as the following:



 	
  * Aug. 1: Registration on the host candidates

 	
  * Sep. 28: Deadline of Submission of the proposals

 	
  * Oct. 5-6: Presentation at openSUSE.Asia Summit 2019

 	
  * Dec. 1: Announcement of the next host


<!-- more -->The registration only requires the informal introduction of the organizers and the city or the country where the summit will take place. Without the registration, you cannot submit your proposal. Please send the introduction and your proposal to both [opensuse-summit@opensuse.org](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-summit/) and [opensuseasia-summit@googlegroups.com](mailto:opensuseasia-summit@googlegroups.com).

We will invite you to our regular online meetings so that you can understand how the summit is organized. Furthermore, we are going to ask you to show your proposals at the next summit in Bali, Indonesia.

The submitted proposals are to be reviewed by the organization committee, and one from them is to be selected by vote. The committee might have additional questions and requests during the review.

More information including former summits, the organization committee, and our annual roadmap until the next summit is available at the Asia Summit Portal: [https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Asia_Summit](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Asia_Summit)
