![](/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/banner.png)Ahoy! [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) [Xfce](https://www.xfce.org/) team is pleased to announce that the long awaited Xfce 4.14 has been released for [Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed).


After a long development cycle (4 years!), all of the core components and applications have been ported to [GTK](https://www.gtk.org/) 3.

Among the main new features and improvements, the xfwm4 window manager has finally gained support for [VSync](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/V/Vsync.html),[ HiDPI](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/HiDPI), hardware GLX and various compositor improvements.

You can check out the neat new features in the official [Xfce 4.14 tour](https://www.xfce.org/about/tour) and the [official release announcement](https://www.xfce.org/about/news/?post=1565568000).


#### **openSUSE ****C****hanges**




For openSUSE, we continued to polish the default experience by adding new packages that complete the desktop and make it more approachable to new users.




We:




- Switched to xfce4-screensaver, the new Xfce screenlocker, from xscreensaver




- Added xfce4-panel-profiles, a tool to back up and restore your panel layout configuration as well as layout presets




- Added mugshot, a tool to easily input personal information and a user avatar. It is integrated into the Whisker Menu




- Added lightdm-gtk-greeter-settings, a tool to easily configure [LightDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LightDM)




- Added gnome-disk-utility, a disk management tool that allows you to partition disks and mount ISO files





#### **New GTK ****T****heme**




In the process of updating to Xfce 4.14, we decided that we wanted to have our very own GTK theme. Thus, [Greybird Geeko](https://github.com/shimmerproject/Greybird-Geeko) was born.




Based on the popular Greybird Xfce theme, Greybird Geeko is an official spin with an openSUSE look & feel and other improvements, such as a dark variant of the theme. 




A special shout out to Carson Black who carried out the work and maintains this theme! For a quick overview, please check out the [screenshots](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Xfce/Screenshots).




A big "thank you" to everyone who got involved in this release!
