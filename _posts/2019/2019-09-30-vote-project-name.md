![](/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/i-want-you-1.jpg)Following discussions about the "openSUSE Project logo & name change" that started in June on the openSUSE Project mailing list [1], the Election Committee received a request from the Board to conduct a vote whereby openSUSE members can indicate whether they are for or against the project name change.

The voting will start on Oct. 10 and end on Oct. 31, which will provide three weeks for members to vote. The result will be announced on Nov. 1.

The voting exercise is limited to [openSUSE members](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Members) only.

The voting procedure will be similar to the board elections. Members will receive a voting link on their membership email alias, i.e @opensuse.org. Members should verify that their openSUSE email alias is working and redirecting to the correct email address. If you experience troubles with your email alias, please email [admin@opensuse.org](mailto:admin@opensuse.org) to resolve the issue.

Members who wish to change the target address of their email alias can do so by creating a ticket. That can be done by sending the change request to [admin@opensuse.org](mailto:admin@opensuse.org).

Those who wish to become an openSUSE member they can apply for membership by following the instructions specified on the openSUSE Wiki page [2].

The Election Committee can be reached through [election-officials@opensuse.org](mailto:election-officials@opensuse.org).
