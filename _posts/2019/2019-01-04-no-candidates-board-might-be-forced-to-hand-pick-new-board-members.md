There are less than 10 days left to apply as a Candidate for the [openSUSE Board Elections](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election), yet as of this date, no eligible Candidates have stepped up to run for the three vacant Board Member Seats.  If there are no Candidates by the closing date of **January 13, 2019**, the three remaining members of the [openSUSE Board](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board) will be tasked to choose new Board Members, _based on their own personal choices_, to fill those three vacant seats.

### Healthy Project Needs Members


The [Elections Committee](mailto:election-officials@opensuse.org) would like to remind all [openSUSE Contributors](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:How_to_participate) that a healthy [Project](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Project) is only possible if it has a robust roster of [Members](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Members), and if enough of those Members step up to participate in the duties performed by the various openSUSE teams.  That includes serving as Members of the openSUSE Board, which is best chosen by the openSUSE Members in the voting process.


### Is openSUSE Worth It to You?


In order for that to happen, the [Project](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Project) needs several openSUSE Enthusiasts to pay it forward by stepping up to run in the [2018-2019 openSUSE Board Elections](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election) and thus provide a full slate of Quality Candidates.  Therefore, the Elections Committee is appealing for those contributors who believe [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) is a Project worth keeping alive to forward their applications as Candidates in the upcoming elections.


### Deadline is Approaching Fast


In order to do that, you must have an [openSUSE Membership](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Members) in [Good Standing](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Guiding_principles).  If you do not have a Membership, yet would like to show your dedication to [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) by running for the Board, you need to get your Membership Application in immediately so it is approved before the January 13 Candidate Application deadline.

[You can apply for openSUSE Membership by following the instructions here.](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Members)

You can apply to run as an openSUSE Board Candidate by sending e-mail to:



 	
  * [opensuse-project@opensuse.org](mailto:opensuse-project@opensuse.org) **and**

 	
  * [election-officials@opensuse.org](mailto:election-officials@opensuse.org).


[More information can be found here](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election) and [here](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election_rules).
