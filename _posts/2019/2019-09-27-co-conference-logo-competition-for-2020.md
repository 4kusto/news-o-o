![](/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/libocon.png)![](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/oSC19_logo_thumb.png)The [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) and [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) communities will have a joint conference next year in [Nuremberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg), Germany, and for this special co-conference, we are having a logo competition. The dates of the event are still being finalized, but there are some things we can do beforehand.

A logo is essential for the conference and we want to visualize both communities during this co-conference as LibreOffice will celebrate its 10-year anniversary and openSUSE will celebrate its 15-year anniversary during the conference.

The [LibOcon](https://libocon.org/) logo should not be confused with the LibreOffice 10th anniversary logo contest, which will be announced separately via the [LibreOffice blog](https://blog.documentfoundation.org/).

You have seen both the [openSUSE Conference](https://events.opensuse.org/) logo and [LibOcon](https://libocon.org/) logo change over the years. For this unique co-conference, we would like to have a unique logo reflecting both communities in one logo.

The competition is open now and **ends on January, 17, 2020**. The organizing team will send “Mystery Box” as an appreciation for the best logo designed. This year, logo will be voted on by the organizers of the conference.

**Deadline:** 17 January 2020 UTC 13:00

**Announcement Winner:** 1 Feb. 2020 at [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/)

The Rules of the Contest are as follows:



 	
  * The logo should be licensed under[ CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) and allow everyone to use the logo without attribution (BY) if your work is used as the logo of LibOcon/oSC20. Note that the attribution is going to be shown on the conference website.
