![](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/oSC19_logo_thumb.png)openSUSE is pleased to announce the first phase for accepting talks for the [openSUSE Conference 2019](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC19) (oSC19) has begun.

A total of 80 talks were submitted during the call for papers, which began in late fall and ended Feb. 4. In total, there were 42 normal talks, two long workshops, four short workshops, 19 short talks and seven lighting talks submitted.

The review team rated all the submitted abstracts and selected 22 normal talks, two long workshops, four short workshops, 13 short talks and five lighting talks.

Speakers have been notified of their accepted talk and must confirm their talk by March 1. If a speaker doesnâ€™t confirm their talk by March 1, the talk will be withdrawn and the next highest rated talks will be accepted to fill the slot as part of the second phase of the talk selections for oSC19. Phase 2 will run from March 2 to March 16. The schedule for the conference will be published shortly after Phase 2.

There are five tracks listed for the conference this year. The tracks are:



 	
  * openSUSE

 	
  * Open Source Software

 	
  * Cloud and Containers

 	
  * Embedded Systems

 	
  * Desktop and Applications


The openSUSE Conference will take place at the Z-Bau in Nuremberg, Germany, from May 24 - 26.
