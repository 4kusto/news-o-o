#### openSUSE and TUXEDO Computers want to offer the best user experience


**KÖNIGSBRUNN, Germany --** The cooperation between [TUXEDO Computers](https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/) and the [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) project has existed since 2018. This has been very successful, so that the release team of openSUSE has received a permanent loan from TUXEDO Computers and has developed and further developed the new version [Leap 15.1](https://software.opensuse.org/distributions/leap/15_1) on the InfinityBook Pro 13, which will be released soon.

The openSUSE project mainly uses the InfinityBook Pro 13 from the TUXEDO Computers range. It offers numerous configuration options and is characterized by its mobility, runtime, performance, quality and flexibility. The internal tests at openSUSE were consistently positive. [Further information and benchmarks can be found in the current joint success story, which is available for download.](https://cloud.tuxedo.de/index.php/s/6H3NbEfs5T5wFkT)
