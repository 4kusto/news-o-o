FOSDEM is the biggest event organized by and for the Free and Open Source (FOSS) community. Its goal is to provide developers a place to meet, come together and share and discuss ideas. The event happens 4-5 February 2012 in Brussels, Belgium. And there will again be a cross-distribution mini conference at FOSDEM this year. By organizing a mini conference where all distributions participate in we foster collaboration and cross pollination. You are hereby invited to hold a session.

If you're interested let your intention be known on the [distributions@lists.fosdem.org](mailto:distributions@lists.fosdem.org) mailinglist, with the following information and we will factor in your contribution.
