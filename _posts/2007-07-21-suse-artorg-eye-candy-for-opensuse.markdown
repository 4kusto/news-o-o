[SUSE-Art.org](//suse-art.org/), part of the [openDesktop.org network](//www.opendesktop.org/) which evolved around the original [KDE-Look.org](//kde-look.org) site, went online recently after the Hack Week during which Frank Karlitschek worked on setting it up. Besides some generic content which is shared with its sisters exist categories like SUSE branded wallpapers, SUSE desktop screenshots and "SUSE Brainstorming" which allow you to share, comment and vote your contributions.
