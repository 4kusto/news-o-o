[Mingle Today!](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/03/15/mingle-today/)

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/about_connect-300x128.png)

It all started out with a simple question Pavol Rusnak asked on the openSUSE Conference
      ™09 

What are we really doing when we develop a new tool to handle
        openSUSE users and groups?
    

The answer was simple: Connecting people to projects, groups and with each other.
      Connecting faces to names, nicknames and to email addresses. In the end connecting all our
      other tools to this one so we can share the data. These are the fundamental ideas behind our
      newest openSUSE tool: [connect](http://connect.opensuse.org/). In the
      following months the [openSUSE
        Boosters](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Boosters_team) and friends started to work on this tool based on [Elgg](http://elgg.org/). An open source social networking engine, that delivers
      the building blocks that enable us to create our own fully-featured social network. And today
      we release it to you, the openSUSE Community.

**What is connect?**
    

First and foremost connect is a user database. The openSUSE project operates a lot of
      tools and most of them require users to authenticate to operate them, have some kind of access
      level for different user types (groups) and possibly other attributes stored for the user like
      contact information, an avatar or a description of the person. Instead of having to enter and
      maintain this information over and over again in each tool, connect is the first step in
      centralizing this.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/connect_userprofile-e1300199288617-300x146.jpg)

Secondly connect introduces the nowadays mandatory social features. Instead of rather
      boring collection of user attributes, connect reflects the social relations among the openSUSE
      community. It allows the users to share activities, places, events and interests within their
      network. It truly helps you to connect with other lizards.

**And what can I do with it?**
    

Make friends and tell them about yourself. See what they are up to in the Build Service,
      openFATE or Bugzilla. Find out who your friends, friends are or get your openSUSE business
      cards. Or how about you gang up in groups and collaborate in discussions, run your own polls
      and create your groups events? You can also apply to be an [openSUSE Member](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Members) and vote in project
      wide polls like the [openSUSE Board](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board)
      election. And more!

</td>
          </tr></tbody></table>


    

**Can I improve it? **

connect is far from done and is constantly under development, so please help out! Are you
      able to explain complicated IT coherences so your grandma can understand them? Help us to
      document the various tools and processes in connect. Is web-development your thing and you
      master any HTML/CSS? Then improve the whole user experience. Or is PHP coding your thing? Get
      your editor out then and extend this tool to your needs. As mentioned in the beginning of this
      article, connect is based on an open source social networking platform called Elgg. They have
        [fantastic documentation](http://docs.elgg.org/) on how to [theme it](http://docs.elgg.org/wiki/Themes), [getting started with Elgg
        development](http://docs.elgg.org/wiki/Getting_Started_With_Development) or how to extend it with [plugins](http://docs.elgg.org/wiki/Plugin_development). They also run their own
        [community](http://community.elgg.org/) where you can talk to other Elgg
      developers and users.

You can read, check out and alter the code that is running on connect.opensuse.org in our
      gitorious repository [http://gitorious.org/opensuse/connect ](http://gitorious.org/opensuse/connect)and communicate with us about your changes on
      our mailing list [opensuse-web](mailto:opensuse-web@opensuse.org), so get
      going. Happy Hacking!

**Enjoy this new addition to the family of openSUSE tools ¦and don™t
        forget to mingle today!**

[SUSE Studio: Upgrade your older appliances to openSUSE 11.4](http://blog.susestudio.com/2011/03/upgrade-your-older-appliances-to.html)

Since [rolling
          out openSUSE 11.4 support](http://blog.susestudio.com/2011/03/opensuse-114-support.html) last week we have been flooded by questions how to
        upgrade older openSUSE appliances to 11.4. Today we have an answer ” we enabled the 11.4
        upgrade. 

Just open your old 11.3 (or even 11.1 or 11.2) appliance, go to the Start tab and click
        on the Upgrade button in the bar at the top.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Ryt4lL8lzzw/TYC41WIUnSI/AAAAAAAACbs/D5rGgW2xxXs/s400/upgrade-bar.png)

After that, we'll perform the magic ” upgrading your appliance to 11.4! 

What exactly magic means here? We try to change repositories to their 11.4 equivalents
        and sometimes add or remove few packages to ensure everything works smoothly. You can see
        what exactly was done in the log accessible from the bar at the bottom of the Start
        tab.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9reWEww3YEM/TYC6r3audPI/AAAAAAAACbw/8ofaGp9m8iw/s320/upgrade-bar2.png)

Sometimes the upgraded appliance will need some more tweaks to make it work. Just
        inspect the log, see what was changed, and apply any additional adjustments. Let us know
        what you had to do on our [forum](http://susestudio.com/forum/) or [mailing list](mailto:studio-users@suse.de) so we can improve the upgrade in
        the future. 

If you are not satisifed with the upgrade, you can always revert to original version by
        clicking the Undo upgrade link.

"I wanted to open a fate feature about this when I first heard of plymouth, but
            reading
            http://fedoramagazine.wordpress.com/2008/10/21/interview-fedora-10s-better-startup/
            really makes me think we should go this way.

Ray's comment starting with "Every flicker and mode change in the boot
            process takes away from the whole experience." is especially interesting. Is it
            okay to track the "don't show grub by default" here?"

            [Update to GRUB v2 (Score: 106)](https://features.opensuse.org/308497)
          

"Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn't
            going to go away. The code itself isn't well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It's only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don't have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)
            (...)"

              crowd-source a HCL](https://features.opensuse.org/311661)
          

"SUSE manually maintained a Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) but this has
            disadvantages: 

- it covers a limited range of hardware 

- parts of it can be outdated or inaccurate 

- it is a lot of effort to maintain 

On the other hand, people want an easy way to know if their hardware works with the
            current or next release of openSUSE. 

This is why a Live image is proposed that can easily be put to CD or
            USB-mass-storage and has an easy way (e.g. icon on desktop) to test access to different
            types of hardware: 

- graphics 

- sound 

- network 

- input 

... 

This software could then upload the test results to a public online database in
            anonymous form. This DB could be the smolt DB or something similar in

[Weekly
            News for March 19](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-testing/2011-03/msg00008.html)

The Testing Core Team met March 14, 2011 at 18:00 UTC.

Our first item of business was to discuss our experiences with openSUSE 11.4, the new
          bugs we had found, and the status of the "most annoying bugs". Most of the latter have
          been fixed, and none of us had found any serious bugs. 

We then discussed the plans for the next "Open Bugs Day", which will be from 00:00 to
          23:59 UTC, Saturday April 2, 2011. The emphasis will be on identifying those bugs reported
          for 11.2 and older that are still present in 11.4. We will not attempt to squash these
          bugs, but to make sure that none have been forgotten. After the release of 11.5 M5, we
          will have a bug-squashing day. 

We also discussed changes to the Web application that Bernhard Wiedermann wrote to
          help in bug selection and processing. The next meeting of the TCT will be on March 28 at
          17:00 UTC to test that application and do our final preparations for the event. 

Please plan to join the bug identification effort.

[Michal HrušeckÃ½: Virtual openSUSE 11.4 Release party](http://michal.hrusecky.net/2011/03/virtual-opensuse-11-4-release-party/)

Last week I managed to attend [virtual ï»¿openSUSE 11.4 Release party](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/03/10/virtual-party-its-now-eat-my-geekos-cake/) in [Second Life](http://secondlife.com/). I got registered there especially to able to attend this event so it
        took me some time to figure out how it all works. Although I™m still learning how Second
        Life works, I™m now able to perform basic tasks and move around freely. Big thanks to
        ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿Morgane Marquis for helping me. I™m still learning new stuff and it™s fun.

![](http://michal.hrusecky.net/wp-content/uploads/sl-300x261.jpg)

Now back to the release party. We meet at Geekos Place in Second Life. It is awesome
        place to visit and you still can. Lot of geekos everywhere. We talked, had a few beers and
        danced. We had DJ Ariella to take care about the music. She is from Australia and she had to
        wake up insanelly early (I think something like 5am) to be our DJ. Big thanks to her.
        Overall, we had a lot of fun. It™s our motto, isn™t it ;-) We even did some huging (if you
        know Jos, you know what I™m talking about). You can see pictures from the party in following galeries:

So it was great and I liked it. Now obvious question is, what was your opinion? Did you
        liked it as much as I have? Do you like virtual events? Would you like to see some more
        virtual events? Let me know and I™ll let Bruno and ï»¿Morgane know ;-)

[openSUSE 11.4 Arrives in San Diego](http://www.bryen.com/opensuse-11-4-arrives-in-san-diego/)
      

The latest release of openSUSE 11.4 on Thursday proved to be a very good release day for
        us around the world. And in celebrating the release day, several of us came to visit San
        Diego™s Kernel Panic Linux User Group ([KPLUG](http://www.kernel-panic.org/)). It was a good crowd at the event with the members of KPLUG and friends
        some of us invited to join the festivities and learn about openSUSE.

Representing openSUSE were local openSUSE guru Tony Su, Brazilian Ambassadors Carlos
        Ribeiro and Izabel Valverde (In town for the recent SCALE and openSUSE Marketing Hackfest in

As most people present weren™t users of openSUSE, we decided to focus our message not
        just on what is so cool and awesome about openSUSE, but rather on how openSUSE complements
        the Project itself. I started out by giving a brief overview of what openSUSE represents as
        a Project and the various things we do in the Project. Tony then continued by giving a live
        demonstration of KDE and then moved on to an in-depth look at YaST. Occasionally, Carlos
        also offered useful information about the various features of openSUSE and even helped out
        with a couple of users after the presentation.

A lot of good questions were generated by the audience, and we saw questions focusing on
        our OBS ervice, SUSE Studio and virtualization. Additionally, people asked questions about
        the Project itself and how it is sponsored. I think people were generally impressed to learn
        and understand that our openSUSE Project is truly a community-driven project and that our
        relationship with our sponsors are collaborative rather than managed.

Afterwards, in the grand tradition of openSUSE Launch Parties, we gave out cake and DVDs
        as well as a bunch of stickers. As I kept near the DVDs to answer questions, I was genuinely
        pleased to see people not only took DVDs for themselves, but asked if they could also take
        extra copies to give to their friends.

![Every green morsel was delicious!](http://www.bryen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/DSC00628-KPLUG-Cake-300x199.png)

  


I have to say that the KPLUG folks were truly a nice group of people, and their
        backgrounds truly very interesting, ranging from systems administrators to piano teacher to
        retiree who can™t quite give up his love for Linux. It was also a pleasure to meet with
        Neil, the president of KPLUG.

Cake was definitely delish. I only wish I had extra days in San Diego before the KPLUG
        event so I could have ordered a proper openSUSE photo cake with logo and all. But, once it
        gets in your stomach, I guess it really doesn™t matter. :-)

Hope to have a chance to visit the guys at KPLUG again, the next time I visit San Diego.
        If you live in the San Diego area, check them out. Next month, they™re doing a presentation
        of MythTV. Should be very interesting!

Next stop, representnin™ GNOME Foundation Accessibility at the CSUN Assistive Technology
        conference in San Diego this week. I™ll update you all on what happens there.

[Greek openSUSE Ambassadors: openSUSE 11.4 Release Party-The Next day](http://opensuseambassadors.blogspot.com/2011/03/opensuse-114-release-party-next-day.html)

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_EX6cn8rqip4/TX1ywq6uNSI/AAAAAAAAAyU/AV-VhjC4u1k/s320/SAM_0746.JPG)

Last night the first Release Party for 11.4 of the Greek openSUSE Community took place.
        We had every reason to celebrate since we have this great distribution that attracted
        peoples attention from the first day of it's release.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_EX6cn8rqip4/TX1z1A1LVlI/AAAAAAAAAy8/g5RDT6EdV98/s320/SAM_0754.JPG)

The Party was once again awesome. Many beautiful people gathered to Rock 'n' Roll and
        celebrate the arrival of openSUSE 11.4. Of course The ambassadors and the other members of
        the community talked to people about the greatness of the openSUSE Project.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_EX6cn8rqip4/TX11Fq8uePI/AAAAAAAAAzs/s0Rwf8ocSBw/s320/SAM_0761.JPG)

We had all kind of freebies for the people to take. We had some serious party equipment
        like balloons and whistles. Of course we also had 11.3 DVD with instructions stickers for
        upgrade on. Also we burned a few 11.4 and we had stickers, openSUSE cheat-cubes, openSUSE
        Calendars and various other openSUSE stuff.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_EX6cn8rqip4/TX10ljqk9TI/AAAAAAAAAzc/FmoXgjojklI/s320/SAM_0758.JPG)

All attendants were given a number and in the end of the night we had a draw and gave
        away 3 openSUSE t-shirts. Also at the end of the night we all sign an openSUSE poster as
        something for the community to remember from that wild night.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_EX6cn8rqip4/TX1-uhteigI/AAAAAAAAA4w/DXSpksZLWus/s320/SAM_0815.JPG)

We proved once again that openSUSE people most of all have fun because openSUSE is more
        than a more than a product.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_EX6cn8rqip4/TX12q0B7xNI/AAAAAAAAA0g/TPsSuzwxOAg/s320/SAM_0769.JPG)

[Nelson Marques: openSUSE 11.4 :: Wine¦ A practical case¦](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/03/15/opensuse-11-4-wine-a-practical-case/)

For some time I follow the [openSUSE
          Forums](http://forums.opensuse.org) which provide me a very interesting view about what our users do with
        openSUSE. I™ve noticed there are some relevant questions about Wine once in a while in the
        Games forums. 

A few time ago one of my friends nagged me a lot to do a couple of levels in [Lord of the Rings Online](http://bit.ly/ei1sL7) which has a ˜Free Play™ plan
        in Europe. People can create an account and play for free the game with some restrictions
        (contents, equipment, items, etc). Players also have the option of using the online game
        store to unlock several aspects of the game. I™ve used a free play account for this, as I
        don™t really dedicate much time to it. 

I™ve downloaded and installed the game in a Windows 7 computer (abour 10.5GB™s), updated
        it and it works as expected. My laptop has somehow better hardware and I™ve decided to see
        how it would run under openSUSE through wine! On [WineHQ](http://www.winehq.org/) there™s some extensive know-how shared by the community about this game¦
        for my little experiment I™ve used the following:

  * Lord of the Rings Online installation files pulled from the installer (since I had
              previously downloaded the game on a Windows machine, I™ve used those files to avoid
              downloading 10.5GB™s again).

  * Wine 32 bits (1.3.12, shipped with openSUSE, LotRO requires also
              wine-gecko);

  * openSUSE 11.4 x86_64;

  * ATI FireGL drivers, release 11.2;

  * PyLotRO Launcher (written in Python, used to launch LOTRO since the normal Turbine
              .NET launcher has some serious issues);

Looking at everything written on WineHQ about LotRO it seems quite a hard task to get
        this running, luckily it™s actually the opposite¦ pretty much a quick step, though time
        consuming due to the size of the game. Here™s the procedures:

**Installing wine on openSUSE 11.4**

Installing wine on openSUSE is pretty easy (like any other software package). Make sure
        you are networked and open your favourite terminal emulator and type in the following
        command: **zypper install wine wine-gecko**. Zypp client will
        pull all the required dependencies and install the software. Please be aware that your
        system needs to have 3D capable drivers, often proprietary drivers.

**Installing Lord of the Rings Online**

As I™ve stated previously, I™ve had available the installation cache files from a
        previous Windows installation which made my life easier (around 10.5GB). If this is not your
        case, you can look into WineHQ and check how it goes with the installer. An interesting
        thread can be found [here](http://bit.ly/fNf5iA). 

When one installs LOTRO on a Windows Machine it will create a folder on the Desktop
        called LOTRO_* which will contain a local cache of the files necessary to install the game.
        Inside of this folder there™s a ˜lotrosetup.exe™ runs the installer. To start the
        installation is quite easy¦ open a terminal (with normal user), navigate to the directory
        where we have the cache files from the installer and run: **wine
          lotrosetup.exe**. The installer window pops up preceded by a small splash screen.
        Follow the instructions on the screen and wait until it deploys the game (took around 30/40
        minutes).

**PyLotRO Launcher for Linux **

There™s ways to run the game and the Turbine launcher (.NET) isn™t really friendly of
        wine. I™ve decided to go for PyLotRO which is a small launcher written in Python. I™ve made
        a small test package which is available on my test repository in OBS ([openSUSE Build Service](http://build.opensuse.org/)) and called it
        python-lotro. You can find it [here](http://bit.ly/e2GLTb). For openSUSE
        11.4 it can download this RPM, [python-lotro-0.1.14-4.1.noarch.rpm](http://bit.ly/eM96wk) and install it with: **sudo zypper install python-lotro-0.1.14-4.1.noarch.rpm**. This will also create
        a link on your Games menu entry (works in GNOME, never tested on KDE). 

You have the Linux launcher installer and are a tiny step away from being able to play
        LoTRO¦

**Updating the Game¦ **

PyLotRO provides a small interface with the very basic functionality available from the
        Turbine Launcher. Allows to configure wine debugging output and patch the game amongst other
        features. Here™s a small screenshot how it™s looks:

<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="40%" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" ><tr >
<td >![](http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screenshot-Lord-of-the-Rings-Online-Launcher-for-Linux.png)
</td></tr></table>

To update the game, it™s only required to hit the ˜**Tools**˜ menu and select ˜**Patch**˜. This will
        access the game contents, download, decrypt and update the game to the latest version. Due
        to the size of the game it really takes a bit of time, so be patient. 

**WARNING**: Before launching the game make sure that you
        have 3D effects disabled on the Desktop (ex: disable compiz or composite in Kwin). If this
        step isn™t done, the game might suffer of great performance issues and weird behavior. If
        something looks fishy, then that™s because you forgot this step. This also made me think in
        one thing¦ What impact will Unity and gnome-shell have in cases like this¦ when the
        accelerated 3D Desktop will generate performance issues in applications like in this case¦
        something to look for in the nearby future¦ 

After the update it™s possible to login into the game, configure the options and give it
        a go¦ You will need a game account first than can be created for free (Europe only as far as
        I am aware, the game seems to be under subscription in the US), make sure you download the
        European client as well.

**Gameplay **

The game tries to detect the best configuration for your system (Low in my case)¦ I™ve
        forced it to Very High, selected my native resolution and gave it a go. The game is fluid
        enough, though lags a bit in big cities (ex: Bree), this is somehow something to expect, the
        same happens in Windows. While I haven™t seen much problems with performance, I™ve disabled
        dynamic lighting and it™s somehow a bit better. The runs nice and everything seems to work. 

I know many tutorials talk about winetricks and d3dx9¦ I™ve not did such things and the
        game runs very nice with the native wine dll™s without having the need of installing
        Microsoft™s DirectX files. 

This was a very pleasant experience, and it really surprised me on the positive.
        OpenSUSE has a very nice version of wine capable of running at least LotRO and World of
        Warcraft without any issues! It™s something that is worth trying with openSUSE!

[Martin Schlander: GNOME NetworkManager Applet in KDE in openSUSE 11.4](http://mschlander.wordpress.com/2011/03/17/gnome-networkmanager-applet-in-kde-in-opensuse-11-4/)

The KDE NetworkManager plasmoid used in openSUSE 11.4 has some issues and rough edges.
        Some of those will be fixed in an online update expected to be out soon. If you want to help
        make the NetworkManager plasmoid better you can read about filing good bug reports against
        it [here](http://userbase.kde.org/NetworkManagement).

If the plasmoid is not working for your needs you can easily and safely use the GNOME
        NetwokManager applet (nm-applet) in KDE instead. Just follow the steps below (# means run as
        root, $ means run as normal user):

  * Upgrade oxygen-gtk “ otherwise nm-applet will fail to
              start:

# zypper addrepo -f http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/KDE:/UpdatedApps/openSUSE_11.4 kua
# zypper install 'oxygen-gtk>=1.0.3'

  * Install nm-applet:

# zypper install NetworkManager-gnome

  * Remove the KDE
              applet:

# zypper remove NetworkManager-kde4-libs

  * Make nm-applet autostart on
              login:

$ ln -s /usr/bin/nm-applet ~/.kde4/Autostart/nm-applet-link

  * Reboot

Thanks to oxygen-gtk nm-applet will even integrate quite well in the look and feel of
        KDE.

[TechRepublic/Jack Wallen: Five tips for faster Web browsing](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/five-tips/five-tips-for-faster-web-browsing/722)

**Takeaway**: If you™re wasting too much time waiting (and
        waiting and waiting) for Web pages to load, give these tips a try. You should see an
        immediate, noticeable boost in speed, making your browsing experience faster and more
        efficient. 

Everyone wants faster Web browsing. After all, who has time to wait for Web pages to
        load these days? This is especially true if you™re a tab-junkie like me. When you live with
        an open browser containing 10 to 15 tabs running at any given time, you know how crucial it
        is to have as fast a browsing experience as possible. But how do you manage this? Are there
        tricks to getting more speed when your pipe is maxed out already? You bet your sweet bits
        and bytes there are. 

Not every solution will work for every user, and not every solution should even be
        attempted by every user. However, if you like to eke out as much blood as you can from every
        turnip, let™s see how you can squeeze a bit more speed from your browsing experience.

### For Developers and Programmers



[Stefan Seyfried: (e)glibc cross compiling issue¦](http://seife.kernalert.de/blog/2011/03/17/eglibc-cross-compiling-issue/)

While building a brand new powerpc cross-compiler with crosstool-ng (which is great), I
        came about a simple issue which was unexpectedly hard to
        fix:

../misc/syslog.c: In function '__vsyslog_chk':
../misc/syslog.c:123: sorry, unimplemented: inlining
failed in call to 'syslog': function body not available
../misc/syslog.c:155: sorry, unimplemented: called from here

Using different combinations of build helper tools, eglibc, gcc, whatever did not really
        help. Even the search engine results were full of the same questions but with very little
        answers, and most of the answers were clearly in the league of cargo cult programming,
        nothing you™d want to rely on for a toolchain to be used by others. 

But finally I came across [this mail from Mike
          Frysinger](http://sourceware.org/ml/libc-help/2009-02/msg00023.html) which finally showed that it can be as easy
        as

CT_LIBC_GLIBC_EXTRA_CFLAGS="-U_FORTIFY_SOURCE"

Of course the question remains why compiling glibc has to be always a major PITA, but
        that™s something I™d rather not discuss in public¦

Josef Reidinger: Temporary overwrite method for specific task

Hi, today I must solve issue with not well structured code. Problem is that one method
        return last correct version, but in one specific case it needs to return newest version
        (even incorrect). There is many calls between top level method which know what needs to call
        and target method which is called from generic code. Now I need to fix it and code is not
        well tested and quite sensitive to changes ( this fix is fix of another fix :) . So what is
        the safest way to change it? 

I decide that the best solution which doesn™t change almost nothing ( but is suitable
        just for maintenance update, for trunk I create better solution ) is temporary overwrite of
        target method to change its behavior. Now how to do it? There is simple
        example:

class T
  def test
    puts "test"
  end

  def lest
    puts "lest"
  end

  def m
    test
  end
end

T.new.m
T.send(:define_method,:m_a) { lest }
T.send(:alias_method, :m_old, :m)
T.send(:alias_method, :m, :m_a)
T.new.m
T.send(:alias_method, :m, :m_old)
T.send(:undef_method, :m_a)
T.send(:undef_method, :m_old)
T.new.m

as you can see after modification class is exact same as before ( except if there is
        method a, but it is possible to handle it via introspection and dynamic choose of method). I
        don™t need to change whole stack of calls to add parameter or introduce new singleton class
        which can have flag. I hope it help someone with his fix of not so well written piece of
        software.

[Martin Schlander: openSUSE 11.4 has been released](http://mschlander.wordpress.com/2011/03/12/opensuse-11-4-has-been-released/)

In case you hadn™t heard, openSUSE 11.4 was released this Thursday, and as usual [opensuse-guide.org](http://opensuse-guide.org/) was updated at the same time. 

I think overall it™s a very good release, besides being the first major distribution to
      ship KDE SC 4.6, LibreOffice Linux 2.6.37 with free Broadcom wlan drivers (for some recent
      chips) and other goodies. 

You can read the announcement [here](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/03/10/opensuse-11-4/) or read the [Product highlights](http://en.opensuse.org/Product_highlights) for a more
      extensive presentation of the new stuff.

As customary I like to also prepare people for the most likely causes of problems:

  * PulseAudio is now installed and enabled in KDE installations by default. If it™s
            causing sound problems, you can disable it in YaST -> Sound -> Other -> PulseAudio
            Configuration (or run ˜setup-pulseaudio “disable™) or even uninstall it “ KDE doesn™t
            have hard dependencies on it.

  * GStreamer is the new default Phonon backend “ enough said. You may want to use
            phonon-backend-xine or phonon-backend-vlc (from Packman) instead, if Amarok or other
            Phonon applications misbehave.

  * The great new KDE Bluetooth tool “ BlueDevil “ has a missing dependency on
            obexd-client, which means you™ll need to install obexd-client yourself in order for
            sending files via Bluetooth to work.

[Nelson Marques: openSUSE 11.4 :: How it goes in Portugal ?!](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/03/13/opensuse-11-4-how-it-goes-in-portugal/)

I™ve been following the biggest general technology forum in Portugal with a close eye for
      openSUSE 11.4 comments and reviews¦ 10 years ago SuSE Linux was one of the predominant Linux
      distributions fighting for first place with Red Hat and followed closely by Debian. The fourth
      place belonged to Slackware.

10 years after¦ Slackware mainly disappeared, the Red Hat/Fedora community somehow
      vanished (judging by LUG member strength), and fate hasn™t been nicer for openSUSE. From most
      of what I read, Ubuntu became the major power, followed by Arch Linux and Debian¦ there™s a
      few pockets of resistance by Mandriva¦ It™s also interesting to see that new users are mainly
      confused between choosing Fedora and openSUSE¦ this relation is also getting strong with drop
      outs from Ubuntu. The timing is good for intervention¦

From what I could see in the reports of openSUSE reviews I™ve seen:

  * Installer “ Users expected something new, but they didn™t disclaimed what they
            expected. They say that openSUSE installer is pretty much offering the same features as
            other distributions. I really don™t know what can be innovated here¦.

  * Updates “ This is one of the points that is most commented in the reviews. Though
            there™s no real claims on what could be improved or what is missing, everyone points to
            a simple conclusion: people seem to like updates and the faster they are done, the
            better. Update timings seem important.

  * Tumbleweed “ There are a lot of expectations towards rolling releases and
            Tumbleweed. This feature seems to captivate a lot of veterans changing from other
            distributions and also new comers. This is without doubt one of the points to invest in
            the future for the local community¦

  * Time of Installation “ Some harsh critics on the installation time. People believe
            that 30 minutes is too much of installation time. I kinda disagree as it seems pretty
            much normal for a DVD install. Installing openSUSE LiveCD™s on real hardware (no
            virtualization) through USB2 and USB3 sticks, is pretty much bellow 10 minutes. Should
            we focus on USB sticks installations and work the methodology? Sounds good as a
            differentiation point.

  * USB Sticks “ Some harsh critics with people using imagewritter and unetbootin. For
            what I was able to determine, this problems seem to be related with the partitions not
            being flagged as ˜active™. Something we can improve here?

  * KDE “ All the reports seem to place openSUSE as the best KDE offer. Nothing was
            expected besides this.

  * OpenSUSE and other distros “ Not much has been written, except some comments
            considering that Mandriva Spring was the only distribution that is more attractive than
            openSUSE 11.4. Only 2 comments place emphasis on this¦ Something we can improve on this
            field ?

  * Support “ Support on those forums is rudimentary¦ Something we can improve and
            that™s being worked on. Soon Portuguese will become available on the official openSUSE
            Forums and a Portuguese Team as been assembled for this. Additionally Jim Henderson is
            contacting Carlos Ribeiro to explore the possibility of having also Brazilian
            contributors and community to help on this Forums. They will become Portuguese (language
            wise) following the work by the Wiki and IRC.

The feedback is very positive, and there™s an abnormal dropouts from Ubuntu and many
      confused people¦. The timing is perfect for taking action¦ and that will happen soon!

[Cornelius Schumacher: It's not an address book](http://blog.cornelius-schumacher.de/2011/03/its-not-address-book.html)

It began about [ten years
        ago](http://markmail.org/message/7ef64iba64mjoy4a), when I [rewrote the
        KDE address book library](http://markmail.org/message/cyt6drrtjjem2xti). I implemented a nice API, vCard parsing, and a
      representation of something I called an Addressee back then, a contact, the data belonging to
      a person or any other entity, closely modelled after the fields of vCard, which is a fine
      standard for storing and exchanging address book data.

We wrote [KAddressBook](http://userbase.kde.org/KAddressBook_4.3) as an
      application to manage contact data on top of the address book library, and while it's a nice
      and useful application, in some ways it still follows to some degree the technical thinking
      coming from the structure of the underlying implementation. This shows in the user interface,
      and makes it less useful, attractive, and intuitive as it could be.

So I thought it would be a good idea to experiment a bit and approach the task of handling
      people data from the other direction. Ignoring technical aspects of the implementation, or
      constraints of underlying technology, but thinking from a user's point of view, thinking about
      what's a natural way how to deal with this kind of data. I started to think and code a bit,
      and during [Hackweek 6](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Hackweek) I went on
      and got the application I started to a level where I think it's time now to share it and
      gather some more feedback.

<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="20%" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" ><tr >
<td >![](http://en.opensuse.org/images/8/8e/Hackweek6Logo.png)
</td></tr></table>

But before I come to the application itself, here is some of the motives and concepts
      behind it.

**Mental model of people**

The first thing I did was trying to come up with an idea of what the mental model is how
      people think about people. The way address books usually present this data is practical in
      some ways, but when you think about other people, do you have an alphabetically ordered list
      of names in your mind? Probably not. So I collected a list of concepts, which better address
      the mental model of people.

**Groups**. People usually belong to some groups. There are
      colleagues, friends, familiy, the weird group of hackers you hang around with on IRC. These
      groups are often used to classify people, and provide a pretty solid way to structure how you
      organize people, the KDE guy you met at last year's Akademy, the colleague who used to study
      with you at university. People often belong to multiple groups, and sometimes there is no
      clear mapping.

**Pictures**. When thinking of people you usually have some
      kind of picture in mind. You would recognize most persons you know on a photo without effort.
      Pictures are widely used to identify people, and pictures of people, especially of people you
      have a closer relation with are easily available from various sources now.

**Fuzzy information**. In many cases the information you have
      about other people is somewhat fuzzy. You might not know the exact address, just a city. You
      might only know a nickname, or the date of the birthday, but not the year, or you might have
      trouble assigning the parts of a foreign name to the fields of a technical address book. Is it
      a middle name or is it part of the given name? Is this the surname, or maybe a suffix? While
      it's nice from a technical view, to have this exact classification of fields of a record, in
      practice and from a human point of view, it often just is neither possible nor important.
      Humans deal with fuzzy information pretty well, especially when dealing with other people. 

**Time**. An important factor to classify information is
      time. You remember that you met a person at a certain time. When having multiple phone numbers
      available, the time, when you got them, will give an important hint about which one is more
      likely to work. In general, knowing when something changes, helps a lot with navigating
      information.

**Space**. Another important factor is space. You think of
      people being close to each other, either physical, as in neighbors, or in a logical way, as in
      family. A family tree is a great example how space is used to organize and structure people.
      There are also numerous other ways how to relate people in a spacial configuration. How they
      appear on a photo, a seating order for a celebration, and many more.

**It's not paper**

In addition to coming up with a way how to meet the mental model of how people think about
      people, I also wanted to take benefit of having available the power of managing the data on a
      computer. There are many address book applications which resemble paper address books, going
      as far as mimicking the texture of the leather cover. But being able to manage the data
      electronically without the restrictions of paper, leather, and spiral binders, gives some
      unique freedom and potential in a couple of areas.

**Ubiquity**. As it's so easy to store, transmit, and
      distribute data electronically, data can be ubiquitous, it can be available at work as well as
      at home, or when being on the road, on your laptop, phone, tablet. It can live in the cloud,
      easily accessible from everywhere.

**History**. Without the restrictions of paper, there is no
      reason to ever delete data. You can keep an unlimited history, which gives you the safety to
      always being able to go back, if you have changed something you later realize you didn't want
      to change, or if a need to access old data arises. This all can be done in a way, which hides
      old data from the current view, to not clutter the most recent view you normally use.

**Low-cost editing**. With electronic data, the cost of
      editing, rearranging, duplicating, and deleting data is very low. You can easily duplicate a
      set of entries about people to do some rearrangements, and then delete it again after a few
      minutes without loosing anything. No striked through entries, no wasted pieces of paper, no
      mess of failed attempts to get something done. This provides the opportunity for ad-hoc
      editing, especially if combined with some kind of history.

**Connect to the cloud**. A ton of personal data lives in the
      cloud, on various web sites, in structured and not so structured ways. With Facebook, Google,
      Linkedin, your corporate directory server, the data on your private mail account and much
      more, you have access to a lot of data from the people you usually deal with. By putting an
      application at the right place, you can connect all this to represent your personal social
      network.

**Unconstrained user interface**

Finally I wanted to go beyond the standard user interface of current address book
      applications. There is much value in standardized interfaces, taking into account style
      guides, using standard components, and all the other good stuff of working in a nicely
      defined, consistent, and integrated environment. But I wanted to experiment with leaving this
      behind and trying some non-standard concepts.

So I decided to not care much about standard widgets, to get rid of everything, which was
      non-essential to the actual application, to use animations gratiously to make the interface
      dynamic and support the user in understanding transitions. I also decided to try a new kind of
      menu, which isn't seen much on desktop applications, but could give more direct access to the
      actions the user needs. Finally I also decided to create a UI, which is not limited to a
      specific form factor, but can deal with a variety of devices, not only classical desktops, but
      also stuff like tablets, or maybe even phones.

**Polka**

Now that you know where I came from let me introduce you to my experiment. I call it
      Polka. It's an application for dealing with people data based on the concepts I described,
      thinking from a user's point of view, matching the mental model of how we think about people,
      and not caring too much about the current status quo in terms of address book applications. I
      summarized that in the FATE entry for my hackweek project, where I called it the [humane address book for the cloud](https://features.opensuse.org/311143). The
      title came from the idea to approach an address book not from the technical point of view, but
      from what is relevant for human users, and to tie it to all the data and functionality which
      is available in the cloud.

<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="30%" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" ><tr >
<td >![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xeFtKuDablU/TX15k4HbdcI/AAAAAAAAAKU/7lus4acD60g/s320/polka_start.png)
</td></tr></table>

I started to think about this quite some time ago, and did write some code here and there,
      but during last hackweek I made the effort to actually put it all together and polish it so
      that it hopefully adequately illustrates the concepts I wanted to experiment with.

Let me explain some of the main elements of Polka.

**Group view **

The central part of Polka is the group view. It shows a group of people and possibly some
      sub groups. The display is based on people's pictures and makes use of the view as a kind of
      canvas, where the members of the groups can freely be arranged. Names are shown for entries
      where no picture is set, and they are shown for all entries, when hovering over with the mouse
      pointer, so it's easy to identify people.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Eqc4BFJcCII/TX15gWlVtUI/AAAAAAAAAKE/D51MxeWvnw4/s320/polka_group.png)

By default all people are shown in a compact regular arrangement, but you can simply move
      all entries around to create a different arrangement. The next screenshot shows an example.
      It's the group of people, who attended the [Osnabrück 8 meeting](http://community.kde.org/KDE_PIM/Meetings/Osnabrueck_8).
      The arrangement reflects where people were on the [group
        photo](http://community.kde.org/File:KDEPIM_Meetings_Osnabrueck8_group.jpg). 

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jPlKm7h6dew/TX15iHRxVLI/AAAAAAAAAKI/Xfh7gyKzxJM/s320/polka_group_menu.png)

That's just one application for arranging people freely. You could also reflect breakout
      groups, seating orders, a family tree, or any other relations between people. The basic idea
      is that you use space to naturally reflect how you are thinking of people. People can be added
      to as many groups as needed, and any group can contain other groups with the same or different
      people. The arrangement of people is specific to the view of the group, but the entries of
      people are always the same, they are just links, so a person can appear in multiple groups,
      but the data is only there once.

**Menus**

For menus and getting access to actions in general I wanted to experiment with something
      different than the classical menu bars and context menus, and see if I could find a way to
      make it more natural and direct to work with the elements shown in the user interface. So I
      got rid of all traditional menus, no menu bar, no status bar, no right clicks.

In the previous screen shot you can see how you get access to actions for a person. If you
      hover over a person, there is shown a fan-like menu, where you can select some person-related
      options. For general options there is the "main" menu disk at the top right, which also shows
      actions on hover. You can also click on the canvas to get options which are related to a
      certain location like adding a label.

This all is pretty simple, and you don't even have to be very exact, when hitting a menu,
      so it probably would also work with a touch screen, although I didn't try it, so take this
      with a grain of salt.

**Person view**

When you click on the "show" menu item, a detailed view of the person is shown. It
      includes all the data you store about this person. This is the usual contact information, but
      most of it is stored in a relatively free form. You don't have to identify components of the
      name or the address for example. They are just text fields. You can also easily add free form
      text by adding comments to every field of the person's data. The speech bubble indicates where
      a comment is there, and you can add general comments to the person's entry. All this helps
      dealing with the fuzziness which data about people often has.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1ahv7j2sCqs/TX15kUMo4PI/AAAAAAAAAKQ/Lr4GH9CfxSE/s320/polka_person.png)

When you hover over a data field, some editor controls are shown to comment, edit or
      remove the field, and the information is shown when the fields was modified the last time.
      This way you can judge, which fields are relevant, and which ones might be outdated, and it
      also can help with putting the entry in the perspective of time, they might be related to
      something which happened at a certain time you remember.

An important element are the pictures of the person. Polka collects pictures from
      different sources on the web, e.g. from your Twitter profile, and you can easily add more
      pictures by using a built in screenshot function. So if you see a picture of a person on a web
      site, in your mail client or any other place, you can just capture it directly from the
      display without having to deal with saving image files or getting URLs.

What the screenshots don't show is how the views transition. It's all done dynamically
      with animations converting between views of different groups or when the details of a person
      are shown. This makes it easier to keep track of what belongs where, and also is fun, because
      it looks and feels nice and smooth.

**History**

Polka takes care of saving data in the background. The user doesn't need to know or think
      of that at all. All changes are saved and the complete history of changes is preserved, so
      data is never lost, and there is no need for confirmation dialogs or anything like
      that.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Nw0nP12fSiY/TX15jK8xDeI/AAAAAAAAAKM/pZrOvHpuDGY/s320/polka_history.png)

The data can also be shared via a server, including the full history. So all your people's
      data is always available and shown in the same way, no matter where you are.

Storing the history also makes it possible to have unlimited undo, even across different
      computers. But I haven't implemented any user interface for that yet.

**Technology**

So much about what Polka does and how the user interface looks and behaves. Although the
      implementation is not that important, it is working code, so some technical details might
      still be interesting.

The data is stored in an application-specific XML format, including all the meta data like
      comments, when something changed, the position of objects in the views. So everything is in
      one place and can easily be versioned and shared. The interface to the XML is generated via
        [kxml_compiler](https://github.com/cornelius/kode/tree/master/kxml_compiler) from an example XML file. So there is a native API to access the data
      without having to maintain the code to read and write the XML and represent it in C++
      objects.

To store history and for sharing the data across machines, everything is stored in a git
      repository. Every change is recorded, so the full history is available in the git history. Git
      is amazing as a storage backend. As it's so fast, it's not really noticable that storing data
      is more than just writing a file, and by using git's distributed nature, sharing the data and
      its history with a server and across different machines comes almost for free.

The UI is implement with QGraphicsView and the Qt animation framework. I thought about
      using QML, but as C++ is my native language, using QGraphicsView directly seemed like the more
      straight-forward way to me. The implementation separates models handling the data and the
      views reasonable well, though, so adding a QML based view should be possible without too much
      hassle.

For the person's view I use Webkit. The data is rendered as HTML and CSS and shown in
      Webkit. This gives some more flexibility and power than a widgets or QGraphicsView based view,
      and also opens a path towards the web. I tried again to write a small library to make it
      convenient to generate HTML and CSS. It's better than some of Spaghetti code I wrote in the
      past for this purpose, but it still doesn't match the elegange of for example some of the Ruby
      based solutions for this. It's a pretty tough problem in C++.

Other than that it's a pretty much standard KDE application. It doesn't make too much use
      of the platform, though, as I consciously didn't use many of the standard UI elements. 

**Code**

The code for Polka is available at [git://anongit.kde.org/scratch/cschumac/polka.git](http://quickgit.kde.org/?p=scratch/cschumac/polka.git). It's still experimental, so use
      with care, although by the use of git as a storage backend your data is pretty safe. 

I don't have specific plans for making a release or making it a more official part of KDE
      right now, but will continue to use it as a playground for trying out concepts and maybe
      provide some inspiration for other projects.

I am interested in feedback and comments. So don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:schumacher@kde.org), if you have questions, ideas, comments,
      or suggestions.

So I'm at the end with this blog post, and while it is a very long post, there is still a
      lot to tell. For now I'll let the code speak, and maybe I'll blog again later to discuss some
      more details about specific aspects of Polka.

[OMG! SUSE!/rtyler: Sharing openSUSE with the world, via MirrorBrain](http://omgsuse.com/content/sharing-opensuse-world-mirrorbrain)

Some of our readers might not know this, but the release of openSUSE 11.4 is actually the
        **second** release that OMG! SUSE! has had the opportunity to
      cover, the first one being [openSUSE
        11.3](http://omgsuse.com/content/meet-opensuse-113). 

Shortly after the 11.3 release, I reached out to some of the folks responsible for
      coordinating the distribution of **terabytes** of openSUSE on
      release day. I managed to interview [Peter Pöml](http://poeml.de/) one of
      the creators of MirrorBrain, the brain (weak-pun intended) behind distributing some of the
      biggest projects on the internet, including [openSUSE](http://opensuse.org/).

<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="10%" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" ><tr >
<td align="right" >![](http://pixelpressicons.com/MinersHelmet.jpg)
</td></tr></table>

At a high level, MirrorBrain allows a central server such as [download.opensuse.org](http://download.opensuse.org/) utilize a vast network of
      "mirrors" for distributing enormous amounts of data in such a way that users are downloading
      from a mirror that's "close" to them. For example, if you're in the UK, MirrorBrain will try
      to bounce you to a UK mirror, failing that a european mirror, and so on.

Enough with the formalities, put on your Miner's cap and let's dig into the
      interview.

**OMG! SUSE!**: The openSUSE project
        uses a tool called MirrorBrain, which (correct me if I'm wrong) tries to automatically
        redirect users to their closest mirror based on a geographic lookup of their IP address.
        When did openSUSE start using MirrorBrain and what motivated the switch?

**Peter**: By the end of 2006, a new openSUSE release (10.0
      maybe?) was just being issued. There were serious problems with stability of the download
      server during the "peak". At the time, I joined a new team to work on the openSUSE Build
      Service. That team used the same download server to publish their work, so I came into contact
      with this part of the infrastructure. As Apache guru, the server crashes were seriously
      irritating me and it was clear to me that something should be done about them. Thus, I started
      working on a solution and made it my obsession for the next three years. The Build Service
      team kind of had to do without me. However, the Build Service benefitted most from my work,
      more than anything else. See below :-)

You probably realize, as I did at the time, the utter importance of the download system,
      because a working download is the life blood of openSUSE; its aorta, so to speak. (Users take
      this for granted, of course.) 

If you think about delivering openSUSE, you might first thing about CD and DVD images.
      However, that's only a part. And it is the part that's not difficult to deal with. The images
      account for about 3 requests per second (peak), which is easily to deal with with a simple
      Perl script that you can hack up in half an hour. That's what other projects do successfully.
      openSUSE also had such a script, but it had some performance issues. 

The real challenge was that we redirect more than ISO images. We have to handle requests on:

  * updates

  * network installs

  * packages built by the build service

When the build service was presented, it quickly became popular, and we soon realized that
      we need a powerful content delivery for all those things. 

Therefore, we are talking about 300-500 requests per second to be handled and redirected.
      That made a good design necessary. In the beginning, a handful of people at SUSE gathered to
      think about the needed feature and the design, but with one early exception I'm the only one
      who ever worked on it. 

If it weren't for the build service, it would have been easy to do the following:

  * redirect requests for ISO images via a little Perl script

  * distribute updates by giving the clients lists of mirror URLs and let them pick a
            mirror, just like Fedora does with yum.

The build service however could not be handled by either of this methods. Since it pushes
      out new packages at an extremely high pace (more than **once a
        minute**). There is simply no time for mirrors to synchronize and for the mirror
      system to stabilize. They'll always lag and be out-of-date by definition.

That's the reason for the design of MirrorBrain. It runs all client requests through a
      single system (also because we wanted to be able to be in a position to count things), and it
      keeps track of the mirrors contents and does that for ISO images, updates and buildservice
      packages alike. 

The openSUSE build service would impossibly have succeeded without MirrorBrain. It can't
      work without it.

But the DVD and CD images' distribution is a bagatelle, from the perspective of
      MirrorBrain. Those 3 req/s don't surface in the graph of a server that constantly gets 300
      req/s. They certainly don't cause any noticeable load. And finally, all the hard work is done
      by the mirrors! Their bandwidth, hardware and manpower which they contribute is what makes
      openSUSE whir. 

You'd have to look very, very hard at [openSUSE's apache stats](http://download.opensuse.org/apachestats/) to see any
      effect of the recent release on openSUSE's infrastructure.

For the mirrors however, the release causes a very noticeable peak, since the files are
      huge (while the request is tiny, which is all that MirrorBrain has to handle). I worked hard
      to collect as many mirrors as possible, over three years, so that openSUSE enjoys the help of
      about 150 mirrors at this time. This number seems to do the demand justice, and there hasn't
      been a shortness of bandwidth since a long time - the US being an exception, where we had only
      a few mirrors sometimes and openSUSE wasn't popular enough to find more. 

Finding mirrors and keeping them working correctly means to communicate with mirror admins
      and to carefully listen to users. One has to have "big ears" to get hold of problems that
      surface for users. Of all the problems that occur, only a very tiny fraction is reported in
      public forums, or even directly to us. Thus, if one happens to hear about some problem it
      usually affects many people, and has to be taken very seriously. 

Another design goal of MirrorBrain was reusability and modularity, because an in-house
      solution didn't seem to have the chance to grow enough. So MirrorBrain is open source and
      freely available to other projects, and attempts to suit them as well. OpenOffice.org and the
      Free Software Foundation use MirrorBrain, and Sourceforge uses components of it. The users
      that I know of are [collected here](http://mirrorbrain.org/users/).

**OMG! SUSE!**: Does MirrorBrain
        incorporate any "health" or speed metrics to try to determine if a mirror is slowing down?
        Could you tell us a bit about how MirrorBrain determines what the "best" mirror for me
        is?

**Peter**: Every mirror is checked once a minute with a
      simple request that it has to answer within 20s. The time seems generous, but has to take into
      account that many mirrors are far away, on the other end of the world so to speak, it can take
      that long to talk to them.

In addition, when assessing mirrors content we do some trickery to make sure that the
      mirror is 100% capable of delivering large files (>2G, >4G) correctly and supporting partial
      transfers (to complete a previously aborted transfer). 

Since mirrors often are older systems, there are still about 30% among them that don't do
      this correctly. 

Further health metrics havn't proven necessary. We had a lot of ideas initially, but
      either they were to difficult to put into practice or not so much needed in reality, as
      real-world experience showed. 

For the distribution of ISO images, it would be quite useful to survey mirrors more
      closely and monitor their "performance", because:

  * A user is directly involved and sitting in front of his computer.

  * Web browsers don't do error checking on downloads

  * Due to the size of the files, a drop in performance can easily catapult the download
            time from an hour to 3 days.

This is where torrents come into play, because (at least for some savvy users) they
      improve on this. Even though distribution via torrents is not known for the good speed that
      you can reach when downloading from fast mirrors. 

There's a lot that could be done in regard to monitoring, and I'd love to see
      contributions. 

Regarding other files (not ISOs), we have pursued a different approach. We have large
      control over the download client that is used to download packages and updates, and we have
      made the client robust to deal with slow or broken mirrors. MirrorBrain is not only a
      redirector, but also a Metalink generator. Metalinks contain all the information that is
      needed to find packages on mirrors and make sure they are 100% intact. MirrorBrain serves
      Metalinks to zypper and YaST, so they can download packages in parallel from multiple mirrors
      at the same time, do error correction and automatically deal with most mirror problems that
      way. 

This method could also used for ISO images (see: [Best way to
        download openSUSE](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2008/12/16/best-way-to-download-opensuse/)) and it would be ideal if web browsers would natively support this
      technology. For now, this isn't the case though. I have been working hard on a standard for
      the Metalink Download Description format for more than a year, because protocol
      standardization would probably lower the barrier of such implementations, and the standard has
      been [published](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5854) in March this year. 

Regarding mirror selection, the client is geolocated by GeoIP and the network prefix and
      its autonomous system is looked at. The process is [illustrated
      here](http://www.poeml.de/~poeml/talks/free_software_CDN_vision.pdf). Mirrors from the same country (or same continent) are preferred, or in the case
      of some countries there's a special configuration that makes sure that a useful choice is
      made. For instance, it could be a nearby country that works best (New Zealand -> Australia),
      or it could be a country far away that works much better than a neighbouring country
      (Mozambique -> Germany instead of South Africa). This [presentation from
        FOSDEM](http://mirrorbrain.org/static/talks/mirrorbrain_fosdem_2010.pdf) contains such an example, which shows that a simple proximity- or
      geolocation-based choice is not enough.

From all mirrors that are eligible for a request, a weighted randomized choice is made, so
      that powerful mirrors can get a larger amount of requests than small ones. It is also possible
      (and necessary) to restrict some mirrors to their country, autonomous system, or network. For
      many mirrors, international bandwidth is scarce and needs to be protected.

**OMG! SUSE!**: For openSUSE 11.4 and
        subsequent major releases, how could MirrorBrain or the openSUSE distribution infrastructure
        improve to make the release process smoother and faster?

**Peter**: Did the 11.3 release leave something to desire in
      this regard? From what I heard, it went smoothly. There is always a little discussion whether
      the use of Akamai during the first day makes things faster or slower, but apart from that I
      didn't hear complaints. However, I'm mostly not involved anymore and miss most of the
      communication going on.

**OMG! SUSE!**: How does the openSUSE
        project ensure that all mirrors that users are being redirected to have the absolute correct
        files at the time of a release?

**Peter**: Registered mirrors pull the images before they are
      released. They are first synchronized in a directory that is not readable to the public (and
      the team makes sure that the mirrors replicate these permissions, so the new stuff doesn't
      "leak"). The release team then waits and checks mirrors periodically, to see when enough
      mirrors have the files. Then a time is agreed on when the permissions are "flipped" to open
      the directory, a procedure often called "bitflip release" which is also employed by other
      Linux distributors. 

The reason behind this is that it takes time to spread the files to the mirrors (it could
      take 3-5 days), and it works best if the files become publicly available within a short
      timeframe on all mirrors at once. If files become available only on one or a few mirrors,
      they'll soon be swamped completely by downloading users, which doesn't please the mirror
      operators (and neither the openSUSE project).

**OMG! SUSE!**: Many existing
        openSUSE users, myself included, use Zypper to upgrade from previous releases. The packages
        are all downloaded from download.opensuse.org, just like ISO images are. Do you have any
        numbers to give us a rough idea of how much traffic upgrades produce?

**Peter**: An upgrade generally consumes less bandwidth than
      a DVD download, because unnecessary stuff isn't downloaded in the first place. It causes more
      requests on download.opensuse.org (let's say, a thousand requests) instead of the single
      request for the image. All that runs through MirrorBrain of course.

**OMG! SUSE!**: Releases typically
        "go live" around mid-day in Europe and early morning in the United States. Do you have an
        idea when traffic "peaks" after a release?

**Peter**: Usually, after 6-10 hours. All traffic that [download.opensuse.org](http://download.opensuse.org/) receives follows a clearly
      visible circadian rhythm. The release peak also follows this and overlays it.

**OMG! SUSE!**: This has all been
        incredibly informative, as it stands right now, are there any other major hurdles or
        challenges faced when distributing openSUSE?

**Peter**: I would like to point out that contributions to
      MirrorBrain would be important, to keep the project alive and improve it further. It is
      important to make it more attractive for more users, to strengthen its user base. A
      contribution could be development (a web frontend is needed, e.g., and IPv6 geolocation),
      sponsoring of the development of a new feature and fixing of bugs, testing, packaging,
      documentation, testing the documentation, or lastly (but not least) a donation. Donations can
      ensure all of the above. We have a [donations
        link](http://mirrorbrain.org/donations/) on the site and feel free to spread the word.

I'd like to take this opportunity to publicly thank Peter for taking time out of his busy
      schedule to share so much information with us about distibuting a major operating system like
      openSUSE. You can learn more about MirrorBrain at [mirrorbrain.org](http://mirrorbrain.org/).

[Jos Poortvliet: Be proud of yourself, Geekos!](http://nowwhatthe.blogspot.com/2011/03/be-proud-of-yourself-geekos.html)

Right now I'm enjoying the post-release stress. Going back and catching up with what was
      delayed due to the release being priority and all... And enjoying huge discussions on
      Identi.ca like [this
        one](http://identi.ca/conversation/65860477#notice-66972122) ;-)

**Me proud of the Geeko!**

The article which went out on Friday made me very proud - [openSUSE 11.4 made a
        splash](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/03/12/opensuse-11-4-made-a-splash/). The title is really correct - we're gathering info on reviews etc on [this page](http://en.opensuse.org/In_the_press) but it is extremely incomplete -
      there are so many reviews, articles, [tweets](http://twitter.com/#!/search/opensuse), [dents](http://bit.ly/e3IAHc), [facebook](http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/openSUSE/45393742283) comments,
        [video's on youtube](http://bit.ly/fPsJaZ) - it is really great! And well
      over **100.000 downloads in 24 hours**, almost twice what we did
      for 11.3 - awesome. openSUSE has its momentum back, that's clear. We already wrote that [in this "end of 2010"
        article](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/01/03/opensuse-finished-2010-big/), and the subsequent Bretzn and Appstore sprints, the marketing sprint and
      all the cool stuff that is going on makes me quite certain about this: the openSUSE conference
      2010 was a real turning point for openSUSE. The Geeko's back in the game!

**Did we leave?**
    

The question that might come up is - did the Geeko ever leave? I had a look at [some statistics](http://opensuse.org/statistics) on our user base.** openSUSE has 7-8 million users**, that's significant! And,
      interestingly enough, between 30-50% more than Fedora. Ubuntu has no statistics online but
      once made some noise about numbers - talking somewhere between 6 and 8.

**So be a proud Geeko! **

Now all these numbers have some uncertainty associated with them, nothing is sure. Yet the
      numbers of Fedora and openSUSE at least are measured in the same way, so likely you can at
      least compare them roughly. And I bet Ubuntu has similar statisics on which they based their
      number - with the usual exaggeration. So even though the numbers aren't entirely clear, it is
      interesting to see openSUSE ain't exactly insignificant as many seem to believe... Not only do
      we have amazing technology like [OBS](http://build.opensuse.org/) and [Studio](http://susestudio.com/) but we also have a HUGE user base whom we serve
      with [a pretty awesome
        distro](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/03/10/opensuse-11-4/)! So, Geeko's, in the communication and marketing department - maybe openSUSE
      is not well known for that. But we're a leading distro when it comes to what matters - users
      and technology. Be proud!

[Klaas Freitag: openSUSE and Kraft on CLT](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/03/17/opensuse-and-kraft-on-clt/)

First some news about my KDE project [Kraft](http://volle-kraft-voraus.de/): 

A review was posted on [Technewsworld.com](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/03/17/opensuse-and-kraft-on-clt/Technewsworld.com) with title [Kraft: A No-Nonsense
        Office Assistant That Gets Straight to Work](http://bit.ly/f40Pux). Nice title, and also the bottomline of
      the whole article. Good to read, however I am wondering why the author tested Kraft version
      0.32 instead the current one 0.40 which is out already for ten month. Are there *still* 0.32
      packages around in the Ubuntu-World? On the [download page](http://volle-kraft-voraus.de/Main/Download) on Kraft™s website,
      there are good Ubuntu packages linked thanks to Rohan Garg. 

The only remark in the review was that the list of document types should be editable. It
      is since 0.40 :-) Anyway, thanks for considering Kraft for a review. 

On next weekend I will be in Chemnitz on the [Chemnitzer Linux Tage](http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2011/). I will give a
      talk titled [Linux im Büro von
        Kleinunternehmen](http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2011/vortraege/800) (Linux in the small enterprise). Beside other interesting things I
      will present Kraft of course. It will be a talk for people who are new to Linux but try to get
      their work done with Linux. I am looking forward as I enjoy these solution focused topics. If
      you are interested, show up and we talk about Kraft. And, yes, a new release of Kraft is also
      on the way, it can™t take too long any more.

[Andres Silva: openSUSE Release Party - Provo, UT](http://anditosan.blogspot.com/2011/03/opensuse-release-party-provo-ut.html)

The openSUSE release party was a lot of fun and I was very happy to be there one more
      time. The Novell facility in Provo, UT is pretty big and had plenty of room to accommodate the
      few of us that attended. I met a few personalities as well, most of them participants of the
      SLED version of openSUSE sponsored by Novell. I also had the chance to talk to some of the
      guys there about what they did as part of the project and felt like my contributions to the
      project seem to be so much smaller than theirs. People working for XEN, the package manager,
      Yast and others have put a lot of effort into making openSUSE a great distribution. 

I am happy for their achievement and their contribution as well. openSUSE would not be my
      favorite distribution if it wasn't for much of the work that these people do. So a big THANK
      YOU to all of them. They also had pizza, a few goodies and 2 big screens. That did it for me.
      I was happy to see openSUSE handling big screens like that. Although with gnome 3 and the
      resolution, there were some glitches. 

Anyway, I promised some pics and here they are. They are not the greatest quality, I used
      my Palm Pre to take the shots and the lighting was not that great for this tiny phone.

### Call for participation



[GNU Free Call: An Open Source Skype Alternative](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/222556/gnu_free_call_an_open_source_skype_alternative.html)
      

There's no denying that [Skype](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/216382/skype_growth_eats_into_international_calls.html) is by far the most ubiquitous VoIP service today, but a new project
        launched this week aims to create an open source alternative.

GNU Free Call, which was [announced](http://planet.gnu.org/gnutelephony/) on Monday by the GNU Project, will offer a service that's both secure
        and usable on all platforms, much the way closed-source Skype is, its developers say. The
        key difference, however, will be that it's available "without requiring a central service
        provider to register with, without using insecure source secret binary protocols that may
        have back-doors, and without having network control points of any kind that can be exploited
        or abused by external parties," its creators say.

![](http://zapp5.staticworld.net/news/graphics/205761-headset_mic_180_original.jpg)

Rather, GNU Free Call will offer what they call "a self organizing meshed calling
        network," thereby eliminating potentially vulnerable service control points and ensuring the
        continuation of emergency services even if the existing communication infrastructure has
        been disrupted.

[Ostatic/Susan Linton: openSUSE Thinking About Naming Change](http://ostatic.com/blog/opensuse-thinking-about-naming-change)

Andreas Jaeger, Program Manager at Novell for openSUSE, has posted about an on-going
        discussion concerning the naming convention of openSUSE. Apparently the traditional "old
        school" 11.4, 12.0, 12.1, etc. might need some modernization. Developers and active users
        have suggested several alternatives.

Jaeger [explains](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/03/11/how-to-name-the-distribution-releases/) that despite common belief openSUSE doesn't actually employ major and
        minor number versioning. So to assume that 11.4 is an update to 11.3 is incorrect. That
        explains all the times reviewers said things like 'despite being only a minor version
        upgrade, there are enough new and updated features to warrant a major number up-tick.' They
        just usually "count it always until 3." So, next release would be 12.0.

KDE is beautiful, even if you never change a thing on your desktop. What makes it even
        more appealing is all of the customizable visual features. Three areas you should consider
        spicing up a little are your KDE style/theme, your Plasma Workspace theme, and your icons.

[Moved by Freedom “ Powered by Standards : What does Community really mean? (Part
          2)](http://standardsandfreedom.net/index.php/2011/03/17/what-does-community-mean-part-2/)

[In the first part of this essay](http://standardsandfreedom.net/index.php/2011/03/15/what-does-community-really-mean/) I attempted to describe how communities around
        Free & Open Source Software (FOSS) projects are born and what is their underlying model.
        After having described the conditions necessary to have communities emerge around Free and
        Open Source Software I used [Simon Phipp](http://www.webmink.com/)s™ s
        typology of communities in order to highlight the various roles that are found in these
        groups, and how several sub-groups may be distinguished inside a FOSS community. I ended up
        the first part by hinting at the limits of that typology. Here™s why. 

The very first comment that somewhat counters™ Phipps™ s model is that it ignores the
        fundamentally dynamical nature of FOSS communities and the inherent sociological rejection
        of any real stable state of the social structure inside these communities. It means two
        things: That anyone from the end-user community may turn into a core developer provided
        he/she has the skills and provides relevant contributions in the relevant way (in my
        example, the end-user would have to contribute code patches in a regular fashion to become a
        core developer); second, that the members of these communities have no status that is carved
        in stone. You are not born a core developer, you become one, but you won™t remain one until
        you keep contributing. This in turn highlights two notions that are essential inside FOSS
        communities and that may be seen, as I wrote earlier, as an additional, yet necessary
        description of the way FOSS communities work through and beyond the typology enunciated by
        Simon. (...)

          Wallen: Review: openSUSE 11.4](http://www.ghacks.net/2011/03/13/review-opensuse-11-4/)

Recently it was brought to my attention that all the desktop Linux hoopla in the world
        doesn't mean squat without compelling applications to get the end user interested. To
        address this need, I™ve rounded up fifteen powerful Linux applications that reflect the best
        that Linux has to offer the desktop user, both in and out of the enterprise
        environment.

This is not meant to diminish any excluded apps. Instead my goal is to showcase
        applications that I™ve found to be really powerful for the typical Linux user. (...)

**Booting**

The first thing you™ll notice when the [OpenSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org/) CD/DVD boots, is the looks. They™ve taken the usual, monochromatic
        Choose language, okay, now choose your boot options screen, and made it look welcoming by
        getting it as close to your normal GUI without having to include a mouse. You also get a
        decent amount of boot and language options (e.g. safe boot) but you start off with english
        as the default language (unlike some distros where you have to select a language at the
        booting screen), which might save time for some, but could cause some difficulties for
        non-english speakers. (...)

[PCWorld/Katherine Noyes: 5 Reasons to Try OpenSUSE 11.4](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/222065/5_reasons_to_try_opensuse_114.html)

With hundreds of [Linux distributions](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/204767/a_guide_to_todays_top_10_linux_distributions.html) to choose from, users of the open source operating system
        face what may almost be called an embarrassment of riches, so numerous are their
        options.

Of course there's [Ubuntu](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/221517/work_begins_on_ubuntu_1110_oneiric_ocelot.html)--by far the most frequently downloaded and popular version of Linux,
        according to Distrowatch. Then there's [Linux Mint](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/208620/4_reasons_to_give_linux_mint_10_a_try.html)--my second favorite--along with [Debian](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/218901/debian_60_breaks_free_of_restrictive_licenses.html), [Puppy Linux](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/216488/for_an_old_or_slow_pc_try_puppy_linux_52.html), [Zorin OS](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/214928/5_reasons_to_try_zorin_os_linux.html) and [Splashtop Linux](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/220602/splashtop_linux_a_free_chrome_os_alternative.html), to name just a few.

Another very popular distro is openSUSE, which currently holds Distrowatch's No. 5 spot.
        Version 11.4 of the Novell-backed software was just released last week, and it features a
        number of compelling additions and updates that could make it the right choice for your
        business. Here's a small taste of what you can expect. (...)

[TheRegister/Scott Gilbertson: openSUSE 11.4 rocks despite missing GNOME](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/03/14/opensuse_11_point_4_review/)

**Review** openSUSE 11.4 brings a host of KDE and GNOME
        updates, the first release of OpenOffice fork LibreOffice, and numerous speed improvements. 

Perhaps the biggest news, though, is what's not included. That would be GNOME 3.0. 

Unfortunately for openSUSE fans, the distro's release schedule just didn't quite mesh
        with GNOME's, so GNOME 3.0 will have to wait for openSUSE 11.5, due at the end of the year.

[Kraft: A No-Nonsense Office Assistant](http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/Kraft-A-No-Nonsense-Office-Assistant-That-Gets-Straight-to-Work-72069.html)

**Small-business users with a fondness for open source apps could
          get a lot of mileage out of Kraft, an application for creating, customizing and managing
          correspondence and planning. It settles into its job easily, then presents you with an
          intuitive and familiar interface. Its adherence to XML and PDF is good, but it could stand
          to learn a few other types of formats as well.**

Operating a small business or home office is always fraught with tasks based on creating
        and maintaining office documents. Often, entrepreneurs are stuck using different apps to
        handle each phase of record-keeping and pricing business proposals for each customer. Why
        stretch those tasks over multiple business apps when [Kraft](http://www.volle-kraft-voraus.de/) can do it all in one package? 

[Kraft](http://www.kraftfoodscompany.com/default.htm) (NYSE: KFT) lets
        you create, customize and manage your business correspondence and planning. It uses a [MySQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL) back end and helps you calculate

        spectrum, I have some preliminary findings and lessons which I hope can serve us going
        forward to help improve things. Nothing in here is controversial, I think, but each of these

I have to admit, over the years I haven™t given openSUSE enough love or credit for being
        the outstanding Linux distribution is it. With that said, I wanted to give some attention to
        the latest release coming out of the openSUSE project. And, since the default desktop for
        openSUSE 11.4 is KDE, I will be giving a little extra attention to the KDE desktop. Since
        both might well gain some serious ground, when Ubuntu 11.04 is released, it will be nice for
        users to not only know of its existence, but to also know that openSUSE 11.4 is, in fact, a
        solid distribution worth giving a look. (...)
