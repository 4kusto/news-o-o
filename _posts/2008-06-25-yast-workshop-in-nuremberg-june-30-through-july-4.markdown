Now that openSUSE 11.0 is out the door, the YaST team is looking to get together and improve YaST _even more_.

[Next week](http://en.opensuse.org/YaST/Events/Workshop_Nuremberg_2008) the YaST team will be meeting in Nuremberg, Monday through Friday, to hack on YaST and work on some of the projects on the [YaST Research page](http://en.opensuse.org/YaST/Research).

The improvements in YaST for 11.0 have been amazing, but there's always room for improvement and innovation. Some of the ideas on the table [now include](http://en.opensuse.org/YaST/Research):



	
  * Porting YaST to other distros.

	
  * Integration with PolicyKit.

	
  * A Web interface for YaST.

	
  * Make YaST more IPv6 compatible.

	
  * Improve YaST documentation.


And there's a lot more where that came from. If you'd like to get involved with the Hackshop, but don't happen to be in Nuremberg, there's a few ways you can participate. If you're interested in taking part in the workshop remotely, please join in on [#yast](irc://irc.freenode.net/yast) on Freenode and follow the discussion on yast-devel. We have limited  space at the meeting facilities, but may be able to accommodate a few  interested developers who would like to help improve YaST.

We'll have a full report after the Hackfest, and would welcome suggestions  and discussion on the yast-devel mailing list.
