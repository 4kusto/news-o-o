The openSUSE Project has two seatsÂ  for this year's [openSUSE board elections](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election).

Phase 0 has begun and candidates who have an interest in running for the board will need to notify their intent to run by Jan. 1.


#### Membership Window Open


The window for openSUSE membership is also open. [Apply for membership](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Membership_officials#Process) during a three-week window and be a part of directing outcomes in the project.

Only members elect representatives to serve on the openSUSE Board for a 24 months term.

<!-- more -->openSUSE board members influence the future direction of the project, so if any openSUSE member knows a member they would like to serve on the board, they should contact the election officials to propose the candidate.

The two seats are currently held by Kosta Koudaras and Michal Hrusecky, who are both eligible to run for reelection.

Richard Brown, the openSUSE Board chairman, the current board and the openSUSE Election Committee extended all current board member terms by one month due to scheduling, but the process for electing openSUSE representatives to serve on the board has officially begun.
