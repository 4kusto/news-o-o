Just a quick reminder: the next openSUSE Project meeting is April 8th, at 16:00 UTC. (See [The Fixed Time World Clock](//tinyurl.com/dm6sqa) for the time in your time zone.) As always, the meeting will be held in IRC on the #opensuse-project channel on Freenode.

If you're a mentor or student interested in participating in Google Summer of Code, please attend this meeting!

Please add your topics to the meeting wiki page at:

[//en.opensuse.org/Meetings/Project_Meeting_2009-04-08](//en.opensuse.org/Meetings/Project_Meeting_2009-04-08)

Please add topics as soon as possible. Also, if you have questions for the meeting, but can't attend (we know that the meeting times can't work for everyone) please add them to the agenda as well.

For more on IRC meetings, see: [//en.opensuse.org/Meetings/About](//en.opensuse.org/Meetings/Project_Meeting_2009-04-08).

As always, we meet in #opensuse-project on Freenode. Fire up your favorite IRC client and head over to #opensuse-project.
