![Tumbleweed-black]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Tumbleweed-black-300x127.png)Another week and another five snapshots for [openSUSE](http://opensuse.org)’s rolling release [Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) produced updates for openSSL, GNOME 3.22, Mesa and the Linux Kernel.

Dominique Leuenberger, a core member of the openSUSE release team,  [informed subscribers](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-09/msg00620.html) of the [openSUSE Factory Mailing List](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/) about some of the packages that were updated during the week and some packages users can expect over the next couple of weeks.

[Snapshot 20160928](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-09/msg00621.html) produced an update for [openSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) to 1.0.2j, which patched a high severity Online Certificate Status Protocol vulnerability. The same snapshot also gave users the updated 4.7.5 Linux Kernel.

The previous [snapshot 20160927](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-09/msg00527.html) provided several new [YaST](http://yast.github.io/) updates and some xf86 updates for XServer. [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) plugins, [Perl ](https://www.perl.org/)and fonts-config were updated in the [20160926](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-09/msg00503.html) snapshot.

[Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?gclid=COHD9Ob2us8CFQMjaAodGooMeQ) updated to a new major version with version 49.0.1 in the [20160925](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-09/msg00485.html) snapshot. Amarok, ark, dolphin and konsole also made it into the repositories during this [snapshot.](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-09/msg00485.html)

[Snapshot 20160924](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-09/msg00436.html) provided the largest update of the week. Mesa was updated to version 12.0.3 and there were several applications updates for both KDE and GNOME. Ostree was also updated to version 2016.10.

Packages openSUSE Tumbleweed users can expect coming soon are KDE Plasma 5.8, [freetype](https://www.freetype.org/) 2.7, [Qt](https://www.qt.io/developers/) 5.7, [Mono 4.6](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/releases/) and [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) 4.4, which is waiting on fixes from logrotate and dracut.
