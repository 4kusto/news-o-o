We as a community are still abuzz from the success of the first community organized openSUSE conference in Thessaloniki this past July and many are already looking forward to the openSUSE Conference in Dubrovnik, Croatia next year (oSC14.) As we all know the wheels of time never stop turning and time flies when you're having fun. Therefore, before we know it it will be time to announce the location for oSC15. However, before a new location can be announced it has to be found.

The openSUSE board invites you to consider organizing and hosting the openSUSE conference in 2015. The openSUSE Conference (oSC) is the primary yearly gathering of Geekos from around the world. The conference venue requirements can be [found on the openSUSE wiki](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_venue_requirements). This is your chance to show the world of Geekos the hospitality and culture of your country. One member of the organizing team will be invited to attend oSC14 at the end of April, 2014 in Dubrovnik and present the location of oSC15.

Please submit your proposals to either [opensuse-project@opensuse.org](mailto:opensuse-project@opensuse.org) or [board@opensuse.org](mailto:board@opensuse.org). We are happy to consider proposals from teams that would like to organize the event but are currently not actively involved with the openSUSE community. Proposals are accepted starting now until the end of the year (2013). The board will make a decision about the 2015 location early in 2014 with an announcement to be made at oSC14.

oSC15 should take place in the March-May time frame in 2015, roughly 1 year after oSC14. Your proposal should include a description of the location (city/town and venue) and provide information about your organization team and any experience you may have had organizing other events. Items to consider are cost of lodging around the venue, access to public transportation to and from the airport/train station and hotels to venue, and proximity to a venue for a party.
