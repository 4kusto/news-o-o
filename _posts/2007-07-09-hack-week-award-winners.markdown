The winners of Novell's Hack Week have been announced. The main purpose of Hack Week was for everone to follow his passion, and the awards are really just a bonus. Nonetheless, the awards were taken very seriously and many hours were spent the last two days carefully selecting the winners. With so many great projects, it was an extremely difficult choice. There were many close calls, and so if you didn't win, take heart. [See who has won](http://idea.opensuse.org/content/blog/hack-week-award-winners).
