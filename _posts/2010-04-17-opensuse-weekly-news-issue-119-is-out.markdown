"Milestone 5 (of 7), a snapshot of the Factory work in progress build, leading up to openSUSE 11.3 release in July, is now available for [download](http://software.opensuse.org/developer).  M5 was marked by significant contributions from both the openSUSE Community, and the larger Linux community. We™ve added some interesting new packages, made some updates to core processes, and participated in a coordinated multi-distribution upgrade of a major multimedia component. Over 50 bugs were fixed and 8 new features were implemented."  


####  [**Andrew Wafaa: oSC09 videos**](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/04/16/osc09-videos/)


"Well it™s been almost seven months since our inaugural conference, and there were a load of videos taken. The problem was that our usual VT gurus have been unavailable to do any of the editing etc. So the raw video has languished on the servers waiting for some kind soul to help edit them.  After multiple calls for help and nudges from the marketing team, I decided to see if I could slot it in anywhere (yay me, I™m such a hero :-P ) Thankfully I had some brilliant help from SankarP who refreshed my memory on how to edit video, thanks chief!

"Nice weekend without any further need-to-do's so I worked on the due release 2.4.9 of libgphoto2. (And a dinner invitation to friends, and some biking through the south part of Nuernberg.)  News of 2.4.9 can be found here if you are curious.  First time I used a (more or less ad-hoc) testplan for the ptp2 driver.  I went through the currently 3 major types of remote controllable cameras and tested generic common scenarios of remote control."  


####  [Vincent Untz: GSettings Hackfest: Day 1](http://www.vuntz.net/journal/post/2010/04/13/GSettings-Hackfest:-Day-1)


"Yesterday was the first day of the GSettings Hackfest! Ryan, Matthias, Colin, David and I were locked in a meeting room for the whole day (okay, we went out for lunch and Matthias had to leave afterwards) and we put our brains to good use. Or at least, that's the feeling I got ;-) But first, let me thank the various companies who are helping this hackfest: Novell is sponsoring and hosting it, and Red Hat and Codethink are sending folks here. This hackfest will most certainly make a difference on our road to GNOME 3.0, and the support of those companies is a great contribution! And obviously, without the Foundation support, the event wouldn't have been possible, so here's lots of love from the participants to the Foundation too :-)"|

"Did you know every app built with KDE 4 can save files as easily to a FTP server or a remote computer using SSH as easily as it accesses your local hard disk? You should! This is a feature that I take for granted since it was introduced in the days of KDE 2.0, but it's easy to forget that the majority of KDE users only started using it since then.  A few of our community people got together and wrote this thorough overview of network transparent file management in KDE at the weekend. Cookies to them for writing it and even if you think you are an old KDE hand, give it a read - I didn't know about the handy protocol selector in Dolphin, and that let me discover the settings:/ protocol - now I can access my Settings "|

"This time round I'd like us to discuss Collaboration, Learning, Listening and Leading. Let me clarify what I mean by Collaboration; I'm NOT talking about Groupwise/Exchange/Zimbra/Alfresco/SharePoint/Kablink style collabortaion, but I AM talking about working with other parties and teams.  Within openSUSE as with other distributions there are multiple teams/projects that in some cases could be classed as competitors - GNOME & KDE are a prime example. Just because they are trying to get you to use them doesn't mean they can't have some commonality (other than the underlying OS). I'd love to see more collaboration with other distributions, working with them on the topic of say RPM as an example. Working with upstream DEs and other distros to improve the likes of a11y (that's accessibility for thos that aren't aware, you know - audio/visual/etc impaired), education. You get the idea? Quite often we need to just look past our differences and get on with the job, soon we'll realise (hoipefully) that we are pretty much the same the difference is in the implementation. If we focus locally on how we can collaborate within openSUSE alone then we need to work together with a focused vision and take a demographic, say developers, and get everyone interested to chip in with ways of making it easier and better for developers to use openSUSE. Both KDE and GNOME can easily contribute to this, as can documentation gurus and others. The key here is to have a clearly defined target and work together, effectively combining multiple teams into one."

""It's been two weeks rather than the usual one, because we've been hunting a really annoying VM regression that not a lot of people seem to have seen, but I didn't want to release an -rc4 with it," began Linux creator Linus Torvalds, announcing the 2.6.34-rc4 Linux kernel.

"I recently added a new account to my Claws-Mail configuration. That account will soon become one of my main accounts, so I was not happy about it being shown on the bottom of the folder list, below all my less important accounts.  Using the GUI, I could not find a way to move it around. I already thought about manually changing the configuration, editing all the references for all accounts.  Fortunately, when looking around the ~/.claws-mail directory that contains everything, I found folderlist.xml which is an easy to understand (and edit) XML file that describes how the folders are displayed. I did no fancy stuff, just moved the  ¦  block, that corresponds to the new account up to the first place and voilá ” it works.  BTW: Claws-Mail is still my favourite email client after using it for over a year - that clearly is a new record ;)"

I actually prefer that to an attached file, because I can read the article right away, without having to open another application. When I™m ready to edit, I ask GMail to create a Google document out of it. Trouble is, the resulting file has hard new-line characters after every line, and a double new-line between paragraphs. I could cursor to the end of each line, delete it, and type in a space, but my inner sloth told me there had to be a better way."

"To most people, boot loaders aren't the most exciting aspect of an operating system, but they are extraordinarily important. Without a functioning boot loader, nothing else works. Currently, a transition from the old Grand Unified Bootloader (GRUB) Legacy tool to the new GRUB 2 is underway. GRUB 2 is the default boot loader in Ubuntu 9.10, and it's an option in most other major Linux distributions. Sooner or later, other distributions will deploy GRUB 2 as the default boot loader."

"You may already be familiar with the cat utility, which can send files to standard input and output. Ncat does something similar, except it's for sending data over the network or accepting data to a local machine. In the right hands, ncat can be an extremely useful tool for system administration and troubleshooting.  Setting up Ncat should be pretty easy. It's packaged for most major Linux distributions, so no compiling should be required. Depending on the distro, it might be packaged separately or as part of the Nmap suite. Ncat is part of the nmap package on Ubuntu 9.10, and is ncat on openSUSE. Note that you may also run into variations of ncat called Netcat and others. It has been implemented in a number of ways, but ncat is probably the most popular version in use today. (...)"|
