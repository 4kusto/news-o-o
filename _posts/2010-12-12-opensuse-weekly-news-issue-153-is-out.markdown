<blockquote>**[openSUSE poster and Free Software Calendar 2011 with Linux Magazin](https://news.opensuse.org/2010/12/06/opensuse-poster-and-free-software-calendar-2011-with-linux-magazin/)**
> 
> The Januari edition of the German [Linux-Magazin](http://www.linux-magazin.de) this year will feature something this Magazine has not featured for almost 10 years: a Free Software Event calendar. Sponsored by SUSE, this calendar features many of the upcoming Free Software events in 2011 mingled with interesting tidbits about Linux and Unix history! While this geeky piece of paper (offering the date and time of events in unix time) is cool, the back offers an even more exciting layer of ink: Beer! Our very own Robert Lihm, openSUSE artist Extra-Ordinaire has taken a picture of the [famous Old Toad beer](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Beer), featured at the openSUSE conference. Uttering the infamous words A good beer is a good beer, he decided this would form a good foundation for a poster. Hence, everyone who gets his or her hands on this first 2011 edition of Linux-Magazin can use the back of this Calendar to show how much beer and openSUSE go together (read more about the beer).
      The Linux-Magazin folks have also thought about those for whom German is not a first language “ they have made an English translation of the Calendar and the graphics for both Calendar and Poster are available on the openSUSE wiki for re-print under liberal licensing terms “ the magazine is for sale now, get it or just [download and print the calendars and of course the awesome poster](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Marketing_materials#Folders_and_leaflets)! For the poster we hope to have sources online soon, if you want them now, ask Robert Lihm!FigureÂ 1, Old Toad Poster

> 
> With the openSUSE distribution, we have a set of openSUSE manuals and QuickStart guides.
      You can read them online via [http://doc.opensuse.org](http://doc.opensuse.org). They are installed by default on your system so you can
        access them there as well.

> 
> For openSUSE 11.4, we face the usual challenge of updating the manuals: The documentation
      writers know what™s in the manuals but do not know everything that™s changed and the
      developers know what™s changed but may not know all the manuals. For openSUSE 11.4, I created
        [feature 310944](https://features.opensuse.org/310944) Read the
      documentation at doc.opensuse.orgin openFATE which will be the one reference point for
      documentation. Please add there things that need to be changed in the manuals. I™ve already
      added a few things that came to mind. FigureÂ 2, docs.opensuse.org
> 
> The Novell[ documentation
        team](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Documentation_team) will concentrate on updating the Startup Guide, the GNOME and KDE Quick Guides
      and the Reference guide. They plan to also add a short chapter on the top use cases so that
      for example new users know to use LibreOffice as their Office Suite and where to find more
      information about it. 
> 
> If anybody is interested in helping improve the documentation, please reach out to the
      documentation team on the opensuse-doc mailing list or on IRC on the #opensuse-doc channel on
      the freenode network. You can also find the sources of the manuals at [https://developer.berlios.de/projects/opensuse-doc/](https://developer.berlios.de/projects/opensuse-doc/).
> 
> **Call for help** Please add to [feature 310944](https://features.opensuse.org/310944) new comments that explain
      what needs to be changed in the manuals for openSUSE 11.4.

        the issue with Zombie bugs](https://news.opensuse.org/2010/11/22/opensuse-bug-day-on-saturday-november-27th/), bugs against old, non-maintained versions of openSUSE. A
      team got together in the [#opensuse-bug](irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-bug) channel on the [freenode](http://freenode.net)
      network to review the bugs for any important and still valid information, otherwise closing
      them to clean up [bugzilla](http://bugzilla.novell.com).

        Collaboration thrives!](https://news.opensuse.org/2010/12/10/opensuse-collaboration-thrives/)**
> 
> Earlier this week, the openSUSE Marketing Team held the first of a series of Collaboration
      Days in December. This was, without a doubt, a success with many of our team members showing
      up as well as many newcomers offering to lend a hand.

> The focus for the 6 December event was to review existing support materials for our
    Ambassadors. Moderated by Kostas Koudaras and Carlos Ribeiro, a variety of assignments were
    tackled, from a list that included booth design and organization, kits for Ambassadors,
    presentations, talking points, 2011 planning and much more. To be sure, not everything can be
    accomplished in one day. Heck, even Rome wasn™t built in a day! Still, this day was long “ after
    all, we™re an international bunch, so there were a few more hours than usual :D 
> 
> But the coolest thing was that at the end of the day people volunteered to take on the
    assignments that were not done and committed to finishing them! We™re confident that in the very
    near future, we™ll have just about everything on the list of last Monday will be finished.
    Koudras and Ribeiro are busy sorting out the dones and remaining to-dos and the results will
    be posted on the [marketing
      wiki](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Marketing).FigureÂ 3, Apparently not build in a day

> **More Collaboration Days coming! **
> 
> Meanwhile, Linux Journal is noticing [the spirit of
      openSUSE](http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/has-novell-deal-hampered-opensuse) “ mentioning the Collaboration days in the linked article! The team feels
    full of energy and is looking forward to the next two Collaboration Days scheduled for this
    month. On Monday, 13 December, we™ll have the Marketing Materials Review Day and on Tuesday, 21
    December, we™ll have the PR and Social Media Review Day. 
> 
> To quickly summarize again what we™ll be doing on those two days: 
> 
> Marketing Review Day, under guidance of Chuck Payne and Bryen Yunashko, will review current
    posted materials including, but not limited to, brochures, slide presentations, talking points,
    etc. with the goal to strengthen existing materials and add new materials where needed.
    Moreover, the wiki will be, where needed, reorganized so things will be easier to find. 
> 
> Manu Gupta and Jos Poortvliet will host a Social Media day to focus on improving our
    press/media communication, especially through social media outlets like Twitter/Identi.ca, bogs,
    Facebook and more. If you™re interested in helping out, just do so! It™s great fun and we are
    getting things done.
> 
> **How it works **
> 
> The day begins at 9:00 UTC and ends at 24:00 UTC in the #openSUSE-Marketing channel on
    Freenode IRC The moderators of the day will post the list of suggested assignments. When you
    come by, simply review the list and volunteer for an assignment to complete. Or, if you feel
    there is something else more relevant to your preferences, you may create your own assignment. 
> 
> At the end of the day, the moderators will review the day™s accomplishments and list what
    has been completed and what needs to be completed. This subsequently will be posted on the
    marketing wiki.
> 
> This is an opportunity for people to come together, not just marketing folks, and provide
      their expertise in their areas, whether you are an OBS expert, openSUSE expert, design expert,
      etc.

> Due to the rewrite of the working copy handling osc might fail with the following
          error: Your working copy ˜.™ is in an inconsistent state. Please
            run ˜osc repairwc .™ (Note this might _remove_ files from the .osc/ dir). Please check

> 
> The first package I pushed to openSUSE was Notify OSD (Canonicals Notification
          Agent/Bubble) with a small patch for extended features (skinning/theming) maintained by Roman
          Sukochev. This patch is popular and wasn™t merged with Notify OSD because it ˜breaks™ the spec
          of Notify OSD that states it shouldn™t be skinnable/themable on Ubuntu. 
> 
> Now I™ve packaged a lot of dependencies¦ cracked and patched GTK with a patch taken from
          Ubuntu, spended hours of mind crushing frustration¦. but finally it has landed! The first
          ˜Indicator™ has landed¦ Often known as Ubuntu Me Menu, under openSUSE it will be known as
          ˜indicator-me™.

          Sonar and the only tweak is the Faenza-Dark icon theme, which I also packaged and pushed to
          openSUSE:Contrib. FigureÂ 4, Indicator ME Screenshot 1
> 
> Top right corner¦ Indicator ME on openSUSE. It works¦ I won™t backport it and will only
          maintain it from 11.4 forward. I™m doing this for personal reasons, mainly to become an
          alternative on a localized openSUSE Spin that will be named ˜openSUSE IBERIA™, which was
          already taken into openSUSE-Project by Javier Llorente. 
> 
> The main reason to bring this to openSUSE and into IBERIA is tightly related to the fact
          that most people on the Iberian Peninsula use Ubuntu, so we find the best approach possible to
          offer something as close as Ubuntu and hopefully even a better offer when it comes to
          localization. We don™t want to make of openSUSE a ˜clone™ of Ubuntu, instead we want to make
          the openSUSE experience more close to what people already use. 
> 
> I™m also going to post a small pic of the same software, this time with Canonical™s
          Radiance Theme, which introduces a small ˜tab™ like visual on the bar. This theme is awesome¦
          regardless of what people think of Ubuntu and Canonical¦ This is the kind of polishing that
          makes Canonical successful, not just the ˜marketing™ many point and even despise.

> Indicator ME as landed¦ soon others will follow¦ My plans are to submit this pieces of
          software to GNOME:Apps, and not to push as default, but instead offer them at the distance of
          a ˜zypper in package™ to the openSUSE users out there. And at the same time, since the
          libraries behind it are also packaged¦ be more attractive to developers who might want to use
          them. I see no loss neither an identity crisis on openSUSE by providing more packages and
          alternative software to improve users Desktop experience¦ FigureÂ 5, Indicator ME Screenshot 2

          there™s actually any need to have this indicator, specially when it will bring additional
          efforts on GTK maintenance, and this feature is somehow supported by software like

        [openSUSE makes a splash at Latinoware](https://news.opensuse.org/2010/12/07/opensuse-makes-a-splash-at-latinoware/)
      **
> 
> The openSUSE Brasileiros!
        A few weeks ago, Latinoware offered an opportunity for the Brazilian openSUSE ambassadors to organize an ambassador meeting, combined with a great showing at the Latinoware event itself. The ambassadors gave a series of talks and workshops while answering questions at the booth and helping users with the installation of openSUSE. International visitors Bryen Yushenko and Jos Poortvliet flew in to attend the ambassador meeting, get to know the team and give keynotes about the importance of accessibility and the openSUSE community itself. It is safe to say that the event was hugely successful and of course a lot of fun! FigureÂ 10, Braselieros
> 
> **Venue** Many semi-government organizations or
        government-run companies in Brazil, operating important communal services, have a dual
        purpose. A library provides books and a Museum shows it™s guests the beauty of art. But they
        have other goals too like creating jobs or improving welfare. Latinoware itself is an
        example as it is hosted by Itaipu. Itaipu is ˜s worlds largest hydroelectric dam located
        across the Brazil-Paraguay border (also close to Argentina) and near to Foz do IguaÃ§u, a
        city with about 500.000 inhabitants. Foz do IguaÃ§u is a very touristy place, as it features
        the world largest water fall (Cataratas do IguaÃ§u in English is Iguassu Falls, the water
        falls of Foz do IguaÃ§u). It used to feature an even larger waterfall “ the building of the
        worlds largest hydro-electric dam has however turned the worlds second largest waterfall
        into the biggest. This collaborative effort between the two countries generates about 19% of
        Brazil™s and almost 90% of Paraguay™s annual electricity needs. Itaipu invests heavily in
        social programs to decrease social inequality, build schools and care for the environment.
        And it organizes Latinoware “ an attempt to increase education and support the local
        economy. I don™t have to argue with you why Free Software is far better for the local
        economy than proprietary “ great to see this is recognized by Itaipu. Itaipu itself makes
        heavy use of Free Software, running thousands of openSUSE and SUSE Enterprise systems. John
        Maddog Hall explained on the bus to the conference location: they have a long term
        investment here. When they started building the dams, software was new “ and so were
        software businesses. Even now, the time needed to recoup the building costs (and hence the
        minimum life expectancy of the project) exceeds that of most software companies. Imagine the
        damage if Itaipu would suddenly be stuck with unsupported software running some of it™s most
        crucial infrastructure! Itaipu wisely decided to go for a more long-term, durable solution
        build on Linux. This provides them with software which is maintained by a huge international
        community of large and small businesses and individuals “ and even if they would fail to
        maintain it, Itaipu has the freedom to do it by themselves as they have access to the source
        code.

> **The conference** Latinoware is a big conference with
        thousands of visitors and many simultaneous tracks accompanied by a large exposition area.
        Many prominent Free Software projects gave presentations and featured a booth, as did the
        openSUSE team. Most of the openSUSE ambassadors arrived late on the night before the
        conference so the breakfast at the hotel turned into a meet-and-greet. At the conference the
        team quickly set up the booth and started to prepare for the talks and workshops which were
        scheduled. There was quite a turnout and unfortunately the supply of openSUSE DVD™s provided
        a serious stumbling block “ customs had stopped a shipping of 1000 DVD™s at the border so
        there were only a hundred or so to give away. The ambassadors mitigated the issue by
        performing openSUSE installations at the booth, thus ˜sharing™ the DVD™s in true Free
        Software fashion. The first day ended with a party including a rock band at conference
        venue, openSUSE people fueling party spirit with Bryen Yushenko in the lead and yours truly
        bouncing around as well.FigureÂ 11, Jos Poortvliet gives a keynote at the Conference

> The second day had two keynotes given by openSUSE visitors.
        Bryen Yushenko talked about how thinking about accessibility impacts common software
        development and your writer spoke about the open and collaborative atmosphere in openSUSE
        which has resulted in such innovative technologies as the openSUSE Build Service, KIWI and
        upcoming projects like Bretzn. Like the first day there were other talks and workshops, same
        as the third day. Friday the openSUSE team further organized an ambassador meeting with over
        20 people attending. We did a round of introductions and spoke about the future of openSUSE
        in Brazil and South America in general. The ambassadors who volunteered at Latinoware to
        help out received some cool rewards including openSUSE branded soap, courtesy of the
        creative brain of Carlos Ribeiro.FigureÂ 12, openSUSE Brasil Meeting

        invited people from the KDE, GNOME and Latinoware event teams at the hotel together for a
        party. A few ambassadors went out to get Pizza and Beer, and upon their return the 25 FOSS
        enthusiasts enjoyed some quality time together. Rest assured that the openSUSE team in
        Brazil is very much alive and kickin™ and has great plans for the future. A big thank you
        for the invitation from openSUSE ambassadors Carlos and Izabel “ and extra special hugs for
        Izabel who organized both the openSUSE and the GNOME booth, took care of hotel, travel “ in

        GNOME and KDE booths but also TV-Radio Latinoware featured openSUSE desktops; the openSUSE
        ambassadors organized a large number of well-attended talks and workshops; there was the
        openSUSE keynote; and at the booth many visitors brought their laptops to be equipped with a
        fresh openSUSE installation. In short, we made quite an impact at the conference and brought
        fun with us!FigureÂ 14, Izabel Valverde discusses openSUSE at our booth

      have the the sub-configuration of ECONET enabled that are necessary to exploit this.
> 
> As the ECONET parts of this exploit are not effective on openSUSE and

      I've received bubkiss!! I heard loads of talk from the recent MeeGo Conference about how open
      MeeGo was, but it seems that they are only open to partners who can help them make money; not
      open to the wider community. I am not alone in waiting for a response from them, Fedora and
      Debian are also in limbo waiting for information/clarification and general communication from
      them. The difference between us is the fact that in openSUSE if you want something done the
      best way is to Just Do It :-)

> So in a nutshell, before I make an official release of either I need people to test and
      report back to me what does and doesn't work. I haven't tried doing an upgrade from 1.0.3 to
      1.0.5 or 1.1.0 so maybe someone could try that. Jump onto #opensuse-moblin on Freenode or the
      opensuse-goblin mailing list and let's continue to be trail blazers. Yes I know I need to
      align the mailing list and irc channel names, but I'm waiting for a conclusion to the name
