## openSUSE 12.1: All Green!â–¼

This Special Corner is about Postings about openSUSE 12.1 into the Community and the
      Press.

### Community Articles




        [Han Wen Kam: openSUSE 12.1 gets positive review on LAS](http://sellingfreesoftwareforaliving.blogspot.com/2011/11/opensuse-121-gets-positive-review-on.html)
      

Nice and positive review of openSUSE 12.1 on the Linux Action Show on 20th Nov 2011. The
        YouTube video is embedded below... you may fast-forward to 30:10 where they finally got down
        to the review of openSUSE 12.1. 

Most interesting (the best) comment on that YouTube page was from Jos Poortvliet (our
        openSUSE Community Manager), "VERY nice review guys! Fun to see how opinions on openSUSEï»¿
        have changed in the last year - from 'meh, yeah, is that distro still alive?' to the
        awesomeness now :D If you ever wanna talk about it with me - I'd be happy to be on the
        show..." 

As with most things in life, its all about perception and goodwill. openSUSE 12.1 is
        polished and enjoyable but a number of the great features mentioned, including [SUSE Studio](http://susestudio.com/) and [openSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/), have been around for a
        while... anyway, I'm just happy & enjoying the goodwill towards openSUSE. :)

        [PCWorld/Katherine Noyes: Try OpenSUSE Linux 12.1 for Stability and Flexibility](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/244005/try_opensuse_linux_121_for_stability_and_flexibility.html)
      

Major updates have been coming fast and furious in the world of
        Linux distributions this fall, and this week is no exception. Now joining the ranks of
          [Ubuntu 11.10](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/241831/ubuntu_1110_oneiric_ocelot_bounds_onto_stage.html), [Fedora 16](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/243189/six_good_reasons_to_try_fedora_16.html) and many others is OpenSUSE 12.1, which on Wednesday made its
        debut.

OpenSUSE is currently the fourth most popular [Linux distribution](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/204767/a_guide_to_todays_top_10_linux_distributions.html) on DistroWatch, behind just [Mint](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/243793/get_an_early_taste_of_linux_mint_12.html), Ubuntu and Fedora. I last wrote about OpenSUSE back in March, shortly after
        its last major version, 11.4, arrived on the scene. As I [noted then](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/222065/5_reasons_to_try_opensuse_114.html), the free and open-source operating system offers a lot of compelling
        features to explain its popularity, including stability, power and ease of use.

With this new release, however, OpenSUSE brings even more to the table -- not to mention
        a new numbering scheme, which is why it's now 12.1. Ready for a look? Here's a small
        sampling of what OpenSUSE 12.1 has to offer. (...)

        [Howrtoforge/Falko Thimme: The Perfect Desktop - OpenSUSE 12.1 (GNOME)](http://www.howtoforge.com/the-perfect-desktop-opensuse-12.1-gnome)
      

This tutorial shows how you can set up an [OpenSUSE
          12.1](http://www.opensuse.org/) desktop that is a full-fledged replacement for a Windows desktop, i.e. that
        has all the software that people need to do the things they do on their Windows desktops.
        The advantages are clear: you get a secure system without DRM restrictions that works even
        on old hardware, and the best thing is: all software comes free of charge.

I want to say first that this is not the only way of setting up such a system. There are
        many ways of achieving this goal but this is the way I take. I do not issue any guarantee
        that this will work for you! (...)

**We were never really excited about openSUSE, but 12.1 is well
          positioned to change this: it adds some state-of-the-art technology to the highly polished
          desktop openSUSE is known for¦ **

OpenSUSE 12.1, you say? Did we miss 12.0 then? No, this is the first release in the
        distribution™s slightly altered release numbering: from now on openSUSE will not have a .0
        release but only .1, .2 and .3 releases. Because the distribution is following an
        eight-month release cycle, from now on the November release will always be the .1 release,
        the July release the .2 and the March release the .3. (...)

            [Look at plymouth for splash during boot (Score: 211)](https://features.opensuse.org/305493)
          

I wanted to open a fate feature about this when I first heard of plymouth, but
            reading
            http://fedoramagazine.wordpress.com/2008/10/21/interview-fedora-10s-better-startup/
            really makes me think we should go this way.

Ray's comment starting with "Every flicker and mode change in the boot
            process takes away from the whole experience." is especially interesting. Is it
            okay to track the "don't show grub by default" here?






            [1-click uninstall (Score: 175)](https://features.opensuse.org/305305)
          

An easy way to remove Software! For example: you installed an application with "1-click install" (which will install all the packages that you need), there should be an easy way (also with 1 click) to remove what you have installed with that 1-click operation... in another words: an "1-click Uninstall" to remove installed software (dependencies and packages included).






            [Update to GRUB v2 (Score: 171)](https://features.opensuse.org/308497)
          

Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn't
            going to go away. The code itself isn't well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It's only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don't have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

We need a feedback about packages that are preferred by users and actively used. Debian already has a tool named Popularity contest (popcon)
            
          

* reusing popcon will give us results that are directly comparable with Debian and Ubuntu
          

* packagers team can take care of the package
          

* we need a configuration dialog in YaST that is visible enough
          

* we need a server infrastructure on opensuse.org. (There are certain privacy issues, see Debian FAQ for details)

Please help us - the users, who decide to use in the real business the Linux PIM management.
Please make possible for us to choose - will we use the Semantic Desktop or just would like to switch it off for some reason.

Since years the idea of so called Semantic Desktop is taking huge time and efforts but results still are unappealing.

I admit the work of the developers and any one should be thankful for their efforts in making KDE the best free desktop ever. But... please give some chance to users to choose what they need and prefer.

            [KDE4: widget for battery shows remaining time in popup](https://features.opensuse.org/313002)
          

Since KDE 4.3 the battery widget does neither provide the remaining time nor a GUI way to change it.
openSUSE follows upstream while other distributions patch this.

It is only shown in the popup, after you click on the widget. It is not shown directly and not shown mouse-over.

            [Installer: ability to choose encryption type / strength](https://features.opensuse.org/313003)
          

I would like to request that a feature be added that allows a user to specify the encryption strength for their encrypted LVM. Previously on 11.4, the installer would accept the unlock key and then format the LUKS container to its own default (at the time I think 256bit aes-xts-something), which is overkill for a netbook, and may not be user-desirable. OpenSuSE 12.1 doesn't do this, honoring the LUKS setup that already exists, but nevertheless, being able to choose the bit strength and encryption type (such as aes-cbc-essiv, etc) would be nice. I would be willing to provide any help documentation for a "help" or "what is this?" button on this section (and it could be made part of the "custom (for experts)" section of disk partitioning.

Several of you has all kind of non feature (mostly called bugs) with Gnome3.2 and kde4

I will just copy/google translate/paste here the comment made by Sebastian Siebert on
            his blog

Okay, now that was a long night for me was. ï·½ I™ve researched intensively since
            yesterday evening after the problem of GNOME 3.2 and the XvBA hardware acceleration on
            openSUSE 12.1. Here, a blog reader has pointed out that the direct installation of the
            AMD Catalyst could solve the problem. However, I think the direct installation of
            anything since like AMD will move the existing files, and thus endangering the integrity
            of files. But I had to start somewhere and so did the RPM package and direct install AMD
            compared. I could detect no difference in principle, except that some files were
            installed in a different directory, where they had really nothing to be related. I could
            at first make any sense why the RPM installation failed. To me a very banal story is
            remembered. A specific search path ld.so.conf could possibly be kicked out in openSUSE
            12.1. I have my current openSUSE 11.4 /etc/ld.so.conf compared with that of openSUSE
            12.1 and lo and behold some search paths were removed. I have the necessary path to
            /usr/X11R6/lib/ or created and /usr/X11R6/lib64 in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/fglrx.conf for the
            fglrx driver, and lo and behold vainfo tells me that everything is in order. Now comes
            the interesting question: Is the problem fixed with GNOME 3.2 now? The answer: YES! ï·½
            So, dear people, you invite the makerpm-ati-down script with the updated packaging
            script installs the driver as usual and have fun with the new openSUSE 12.1 and the AMD
            Catalyst driver. (...)

      [h-online/Thorsten Leemhuis: Kernel Log: real-time kernel goes Linux 3.0](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-real-time-kernel-goes-Linux-3-0-1382791.html)
    

**The patches for real-time support are now based on a much more
        recent kernel version. Torvalds has revoked a change merged into 3.2 which had come under
        widespread criticism from developers. AMD and Intel have released new graphics
        drivers.**

With the release of real-time (RT) kernel [3.0.9-rt25](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1214898), Thomas Gleixner
      has declared that the [Linux
        3.0](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/What-s-new-in-Linux-3-0-1279552.html)-based RT tree is now ready for use in live systems. He noted that this new
      version series represents a major leap forward and that development has run pretty smoothly,
      despite major revisions to many of the core techniques.

Gleixner has now handed over responsibility for maintaining RT patches for Linux 3.0 to
      Steven Rostedt, who recently released a [pre-release version of Linux
        3.0.9-rt26](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1217680) for evaluation. Gleixner has ported the changes aimed at improving
      real-time properties to pre-release versions of Linux 3.2 ([1](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.rt.user/7445), [2](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.rt.user/7462), [3](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.rt.user/7499)). The RT patch has shrunk
      substantially in the process, as some of the changes have now been incorporated into the main
      development tree.

        [Mike McCallister: Preparing to Install openSUSE 12.1 from Scratch](http://metaverse.wordpress.com/2011/11/20/preparing-to-install-opensuse-12-1-from-scratch/)
      

You may already know, but [openSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org) released
        v12.1 of the community distribution this week. With a new number before the decimal point, I
        thought it would be a good time for a fresh, clean install on my aging laptop. I could just
        upgrade my existing v11.4 installation, but I like to see what the new install looks like

        [LinuxCareer.com/Rares Aioanei: Learning Linux Commands: sed](http://how-to.linuxcareer.com/learning-linux-commands-sed)
      

**1. Introduction**


Welcome to the second part of our series, a part that will focus on sed, the GNU version. As you will see, there are several variants of sed, which is available for quite a few platforms, but we will focus on GNU sed versions 4.x. Many of you have already heard about sed and already used it, mainly as a substitution tool. But that is just a segment of what sed can do, and we will do our best to show you as much as possible of what you can do with it. The name stands for Stream EDitor, and here "stream" can be a file, a pipe or simply stdin. We expect you to have basic Linux knowledge and if you already worked with regular expressions or at least know what a regexp is, the better. We don't have the space for a full tutorial on regular expressions, so instead we will only give you a basic idea and lots of sed examples. There are lots of documents that deal with the subject, and we'll even have some recommendations, as you will see in a minute. If you require futher assistance please visit our [Linux Forum](http://forum.linuxcareer.com/). (...)

        [LinuxCareer.com/Rares Aioanei: Learning Linux Commands: awk](http://how-to.linuxcareer.com/learning-linux-commands-awk)
      

**1. Introduction**

In this case, the title might be a little misleading. And that is because awk is more than a command, it's a programming language in its own right. You can write awk scripts for complex operations or you can use awk from the command line. The name stands for Aho, Weinberger and Kernighan (yes, Brian Kernighan), the authors of the language, which was started in 1977, hence it shares the same Unix spirit as the other classic *nix utilities. If you're getting used to [C programming](http://how-to.linuxcareer.com/c-development-on-linux-introduction) or know it already, you will see some familiar concepts in awk, especially since the 'k' in awk stands for the same person as the 'k' in K&R, the C programming bible. You will need some command-line knowledge in Linux and possibly some scripting basics, but the last part is optional, as we will try to offer something for everybody. Many thanks to Arnold Robbins for all his work involved in awk. (...)

        [Linuxaria/Truelite.it: Permanent SSH Tunnels with autossh](http://linuxaria.com/howto/permanent-ssh-tunnels-with-autossh?lang=en)
      

There are many occasions where you need to create connections to machines and services that are protected by firewalls because it is appropriate to adequately protect them, but for which the creation of a VPN becomes an excessive burden.


For this reason, the ability to port forwarding via [SSH](http://linuxaria.com/tag/ssh) is very useful for creating an encrypted tunnel from one machine to another, allowing you to enable only local access (such as a MySQL only listens locally) safely, with the only the problem that in case of problems, the SSH connection (and its tunnels) could fall.

[Carlos GonÃ§alves: SOCKS proxy over SSH](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/cgoncalves/~3/Zc0xPQ8pcHc/socks-proxy-over-ssh.html)

Here goes a quick and valuable tip people don't usually know, or at least a couple of
        friends of mine were not aware of. The two keywords will be SOCKS and SSH. 

Connecting over to a remote server, one can bypass unauthorized access blocked by
        usually our network firewall. The most common examples given are restricted access to
        Facebook, MSN or torrents. We can also have unlimited access to all kinds of contents thanks
        to the nice sysadmin managing the network who puts no barriers whatsoever, but we may not
        trust him or the network users to permit unencrypted data flowing openly. Having some way to
        establish an encrypted connection to a known network who we trust, or distrust less, and
        tunneling over it would be safer. This is where SOCKS and SSH can be much of helpful!

      [Kai-Uwe Behrmann:
        Quality of Default ICC Profiles](http://www.oyranos.org/2011/11/quality-of-default-icc-profiles/)
    

On the internet are many places to download ICC profiles, which promise to implement
      standards. But how reliable are these profiles and why should users and distributors care
      about their quality? 

Why quality counts? For many users is real value in reliable colour space definitions.
      Most professionals and advanced amateurs know that wrongly implemented colorimetry can cause
      them unwanted modifications and will sum up over repeated conversions and colour space
      assignments until the error has rendered the colour material useless. But profile conformance
      to the standard, which these profiles claim to represent, is not so obvious. A profile checker
      can only detect conformance to the ICC standard itself, which is about the file format, but
      not about the quality of the encoded data. 

The preferred solution for professionals is to download ICC profiles only from trusted
      vendors. Unfortunately for the open source community, most ICC profiles for common standards
      are restrictively licensed and allow no modifications. However these licenses are a reaction
      to people, who want to push stuff at whim and fake profile names. After all spreading low
      quality fakes will mostly harm users. Such faked profile made it in many open source packages.
      It would help the open source community, if vendors license their ICC profiles for standard
      conditions after the new non restrictive ICC profile license. Then faking profiles, by the
      reasoning of providing them under a free license, would not be needed any more. (...)

[Lotus Notes](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/lotus/products/notes/) is
      what I use at work and the latest v8.5.3 works well on openSUSE 11.4. Although it installed
      without a hitch on 12.1, things goes awry when I start using it. Here are my observations and
      how I managed to get it working again. :) 

For starters, Lotus Notes 8.5.3 only managed to render about half of its interface. For
      example, I could see my inbox but email preview pane is blank. Integrated [SameTime](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/lotus/sametime/) worked but workspaces
      and replication tabs were blank too. I suspect it could be some incompatibility or confusion
      with the GTK libs and I was right... Google is my friend and I discovered a brilliant soul who
      had the same challenge, created a [bug report](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-bugs/2011-11/msg03695.html)
      against openSUSE and even created a workaround/fix.

Since the source code is usually available, software under a free or open open source license can be re-used within another software project rather easily. That is, after all, the whole point of FLOSS. But the potential for FLOSS license violations within software projects is, like any other license, always there.

Critics of FLOSS licenses are usually quick to point out that the very openness of FLOSS source code actually promotes more license violations. Protect yourself, these critics urge, and avoid FLOSS altogether--or at the very least purchase commercial compliance services and products. (...)
