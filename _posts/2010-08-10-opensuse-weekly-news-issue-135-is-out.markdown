####  [Weâ€™re a happy family â€“ The Boosters are hiring!](http://news.opensuse.org/2010/08/05/were-a-happy-family-the-boosters-are-hiring/)


"The openSUSE Boosters are a team of people helping developers of the openSUSE project to take off. It consists of people with skills ranging from low level C hackery over Ruby on Rails mastering to graphical design or project management. The team picks milestones and works on them in a agile fashion. They always follow their mantra: Grow community by enabling community"  


####  [SUSE Studio: Build openSUSE 11.3 appliances now](http://blog.susestudio.com/2010/08/build-opensuse-113-appliances-now.html)


"It took us a bit longer than expected, but now we are happy to announce, that SUSE Studio now also supports building appliances based on openSUSE 11.3. So you can take advantage of the latest and greatest features, which come with this release of openSUSE. We will continue to support building existing appliances on older openSUSE versions, but new openSUSE based appliances will all be 11.3."  


####  [Klaas Freitag: Status openFATE Milestone](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/08/06/status-openfate-milestone/)


"Recently Henne Greenrock sent a status report about the Boosters Standup-Meeting here he said that nothing happened to the openFATE sprint. Well, thatâ€™s only partly true, so it seems to be time to take a closer look and revitalize the project openFATE a bit.  Whatâ€™s the matter with openFATE?  We did a good start with openFATE to involve everybody who is interested into product planning. However, after the screening team was formed it turned out that some parts of the process are not yet working well. The biggest problem is still that the screening team members can not move features from state UNCONFIRMED to NEW which turned out to be crucial for a fluent process. So the Boosters picked up the task since we think this is a huge blocker to work together as a community effectivly."

"Currently the updater applet has been working better than ever but there are some occasions where a large number of packages with a slow inet connection shows you an unpleasant app that you are not sure if it is working or not. Of course this is not only for slow connection, there are sometimes that it really takes a lot and you are not sure why. (...)"

"if i mark the repos to auto update in down side of the equator when internet connections is slower then 1 Mbps i have to wait a long time every package manager start.

Boy, do I look forward to that ;-)"

"On a request, I updated the openSUSE [NX](http://www.nomachine.com/) packages to the latest release, 3.4.0.  If you're an NX user, please test [the packages](http://r.opensu.se/home:pbleser:branches:X11:RemoteDesktop.repo) and report whether they work for you or not. As I don't use NX myself, I'd prefer to have a bit of feedback before pushing the changes to the [X11:RemoteDesktop](http://r.opensu.se/X11:RemoteDesktop) repository."  


####  [Pascal Bleser: openSUSE package index and search](http://dev-loki.blogspot.com/2010/08/opensuse-package-index-and-search.html)


"I've been busy working on a new implementation of our beloved "webpin", which is actually a service for searching for packages in the insane amount of repositories and packages we have, in the distribution, in all openSUSE Build Service repositories, as well as on Packman.  The thing is, it's a bit dated now, and its features are limited by the fact that it's using a relational database to perform search operations. I've been digging into Apache Solr quite a bit over the last few months (did I already mention that it totally rocks? :)) and I thought.. hmm.. why not use that for indexing packages/repositories ?"

Shortly afterwards, he announced that he also intends to send the code to Linus Torvalds for integration into the Linux 2.6.36 kernel. AppArmor can restrict applications to specific actions to prevent attackers who have, for instance, exploited a security hole in a server program, from gaining access to a system and causing major damage."

"Actually, I do not need mobile modem for mobile browsing because I mainly use internet access at home or by using public hotspot, but sometimes I need it when traveling and there is no hotspot available. I bought Vodafone-Huawei USB/HSDPA mobile modem E270, detected as K-3565 on Windows machine.  The modem bundled with 3 GSM, local internet provider here in Indonesia. Price are about IDR 600.000,- , equivalent with approximately US$ 60, with free access bonus for 3 month. The modem also provide modem driver for Windows but sadly without modem driver for Linux.

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is currently popular terms among the virtualization technology. What makes it popular and become the strong competitor for Xen Hypervisor are the technology behind KVM and Red Hat decision to move focus on KVM instead of Xen for next release Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.0. What makes KVM gains an advantage on the technology side are the inclusion KVM module into Linux kernel so we do not need a patch or different kernel as we need for Xen Hypervisor. Beside the two virtualization technology above, those are various virtualization technology running on Linux : VMWare, VirtualBox, OpenVZ etc but Xen and KVM are quite popular among others."

"Switching to a lightweight graphical desktop environment is a great way to improve the overall performance of your system, especially if this system happens to be a notebook or netbook. But if you opt, for example, for LXDE, you'll discover that it lacks a graphical tool for managing power profiles and controlling the processor frequency. This might not be a big problem on a desktop machine, but the ability to adjust power settings is crucial for improving the battery life of your mobile companion. The cpufrequtils utility provides a neat solution to this problem. This utility can help you to tweak power management options from the command line. cpufrequtils is available in the software repositories of most mainstream Linux distributions, so you can install it using your distro's package manager.

"KDE 3.5 was originally released almost five years ago, the last maintenance release clocking in mid-summer of 2008. Regardless of its age, a half-decade after its debut some KDE users still prefer KDE3 over KDE4.  For openSUSE lovers who also love KDE3, the discontinuation of support for openSUSE 11.0 represents the last major release of openSUSE that shipped with KDE3 as an installation option (it actually bundled KDE3 and KDE4 with it).  Wouldn't it be great if you could get all the delicious goodies introduced in openSUSE 11.3 without needing to give up Amarok 1.4 and adjusting to all the sweeping changes made in KDE4?"

I would like to address a few things in this post. First of all, why a strategy, and what will it and won't it do? Second, there is one strategy I'd like to mention specifically, as I think it's disrupting but as a community proposal it deserves to be discussed as any other strategy. That's about the KDE strategy for openSUSE."

So from yesterday, we also have [http://paste.opensuse.org](http://paste.opensuse.org/). Same computer, same IP, just different name if you prefer the other one. As it is the same thing as susepaste.org, links are interchangeable. So you can post something to susepaste.org and send link to paste.opensuse.org or vise versa. Just replace the first part of the url.  Other interesting thing to report is that Pascal Bleser added support for susepaste to pastebinit, so if you don't like mine simple script, you can use more advanced tool face-wink.png But this is nothing new, he already blogged about that. Next steps on openSUSE Paste includes localization, documentation for the script and getting it to the common menu on all openSUSE sites. But I need to get back to other things for a moment so it has to wait a little bit"

"When KDE 4.0 was released, it was clear that it was not finished and not ready for production. By version 4.2, the completely redesigned and recoded desktop environment was starting to regain the stability and depth that many loved about KDE 3, while also adding new features that make KDE a unique and rewarding desktop software compilation.  Just as KDE 3.5 was intended to be a stabilizing, long-term release, the primary goal of KDE 4.5 is to fix outstanding bugs and increase stability. Users will not be blown away by the new features, but there are a few worth noting. Last week I installed the release candidate for KDE 4.5 from the Kubuntu repositories and took it for a spin."

####  [Techgage/Rob Williams: Quick Impressions of openSUSE 11.3](http://techgage.com/news/quick_impressions_of_opensuse_113)


"About two weeks ago, the openSUSE Project released version 11.3 of its popular Linux distribution, and after putting it off for quite a while, I decided to give the latest version a download and see what SUSE has been up to. After all, the last time I took a serious look at SUSE (over four years ago!), it still went by "SuSE"... yes, it's been quite a while. So far, my initial impressions of the latest version are quite good.  The latest version of openSUSE, as expected, includes updated versions of all the software found in the distro, along with a couple of new bundled applications, such as SpiderOak for net syncing and Rosegarden for audio editing.
