Will Stephenson has announced that the KDE team will be having a bug squashing and packaging workshop day on Sunday, April 5:


<blockquote>I'm happy to announce that we're having a bug squashing and packaging workshopÂ  day this Sunday, the 5th of April. Â This is being run in tandem with an upstream KDE bug squashing event running all weekend, so we can effectively sort bugs that are specific to openSUSE out from those that upstream KDE should know about.

For bug squashing, join #kde-bugs and #opensuse-kde on Freenode IRC.

For packaging, the KDE Team will be around #opensuse-kde from 1200CEST (that'sÂ  10:00UTC) and I will present a couple of packaging tutorials and answer questions. Â  If you have an interest in learning to package and have not already mailed me, please send me a personal mail so I can call for
reinforcements if necessary.

See you on Sunday!</blockquote>
