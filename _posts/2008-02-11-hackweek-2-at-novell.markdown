We had last June our first [Hackweek](http://www.novell.com/coolblogs/?p=919) and have this week (from 11th to 15th) our second hackweek.  Some of us do use the [ideas.opensuse.org](http://ideas.opensuse.org) website for collecting ideas but not everybody.

The goal of the hackweek is for everybody in the engineering group of the Open Platform Business Unit  of Novell to work on some innovate and cool ideas - and not look at the usual work.

Therefore you might notice that some people are less communicative this week and will not answer emails or bugzilla at all - and some will send lots of emails discussing what they are doing or would like to do.

I'm inviting everybody to join us hacking, documenting and testing!

Happy Hacking!
