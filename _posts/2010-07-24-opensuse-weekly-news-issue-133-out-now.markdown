"I just commit my work of the last weeks to KDE SVN trunk: The initial version of the dashboard effect plugin for KWin. This makes the plugin an official part of KDE SC 4.6 which will be released early in 2011. Yay! :) To celebrate this event, I opened myself an ice cold bottle of beer!  What are the next steps? Well, I will enhance the plugin during the next weeks: Implement animations and change the blur effect to resemble the logout effect: The logout effect blurs the screen edges more than the center of the screen which looks pretty nice.

####  [#310158: Add the FISH (SSH) in Konqueror and also in other file managers](https://features.opensuse.org/310158)


"Can act as a Konqueror file manager for local files But also, through FTP, WebDAV or other protocols, as a file manager for files on remote machines. The FISH ("fish: / / user @ host") protocol Can Be Used to manipulate files through SSH, Allowing you to use the Konqueror the file manager for almost any machine Can you connect to on the internet."  


####  [#310159: Create the YaST2 modules, so you can make the complete inst. and conf. of Neatx](https://features.opensuse.org/310159)


"Create the YaST2 modules, so you can make the complete installation and configuration of Neatx (NX server)."  


####  [#310162: BeOS like menu for OpenSUSE](https://features.opensuse.org/310162)


"Well, I am not much of a historian when it comes to computers. I do study history though, but of the Middle East in college. This is the thing though. There used to be a very nice operating system back in the 2000s called BeOS. I got to download the iso image (about 50 MB) and installed it on an old Compaq computer and booted it with a diskette. This small operating system had many bugs but it was at the same time very capable. I really enjoyed playing with it. The system was then not too popular and PALM bought it. That was the end of it as a free operating system and then other projects came out of it, like HAIKU and Zeta. Just imitations of the original system but this time based on Linux. One of the things that impressed me the most about this system was its revolutionary System Menu. Unlike Windows, it was located at the top right of the screen. It was not a panel styled menu, it was rather like a box that expanded and contracted depending on the applications that you were running. If you right-clicked it, then you would be able to get the actual menu with all the applications installed on your computer..."  


####  [#310163: Remove Welcome Screen on OpenSUSE KDE](https://features.opensuse.org/310163)


"(...) As I was talking to some people on the KDE IRC channel yesterday, there was a comment made about a possible way to orient new KDE users on how to use the desktop. However, I believe that users should be left clues to discover their desktop on their own. There should not be an intro popup or anything like that. Ponder about this for a moment. What can you say, for example, about paintings. Paintings are not "explained" to anyone. You look at it and you get it in your own particular way. That is enough for you and you know what it means. The clues left by the artist are clear enough to your mind that you find meaning in the painting. You intuitively "know" what the purpose of the painting is. Reflect for a moment on this Cezanne and know what it means..."  


####  [#310165: Add arrow desktiop switching feauture](https://features.opensuse.org/310165)


"This is an old favorite of mine. Here is the problem, switching desktops on a Linux machine with or without compiz is not intuitive. Why? because it is related to some window keys Ctrl+Alt+Right or Left Arrow, it is a secondary menu, or it depends on the mouse being at the corner of the window. All of these ideas, while being well-intentioned, in nature, simply become annoying because they are hard to discover, they are somewhat hidden, and they tend to be not novice user friendly. (...)"  


####  [#310166: Add audiokonverter in openSUSE Linux 11.4](https://features.opensuse.org/310166)


"Add audiokonverter program, by default on openSUSE Linux 11.4."  


####  [#310175: Zypper / YAST should cache partially downloaded packages](https://features.opensuse.org/310175)


"I have a flaky internet connection. So it's important for me to be able to resume partially downloaded files. I would like the YAST software manager and Zypper to resume downloads of packages where I left off in case of any error."  


####  [#310176: Switch to sssd for LDAP/Kerberos authentication](https://features.opensuse.org/310176)


"Because of the various issues we face with nss_ldap/pam_ldap (see e.g. bug#477061, bug#157078 and others) and because of the added value sssd gives us (e.g. offline support, integrated kerberos support). We should change yast2-ldap-client to configure sssd instead of nss_ldap/pam_ldap/pam_kerberos.  sssd packages are already available for 11.3. We still need to add support for it in pam-config."  


####  [#310177: Yast Package Management - return to the search window after installing packages](https://features.opensuse.org/310177)


"Currently in the GUI based Yast's Package management tool, after you select some packages to install and you click Install, it performs the download and installation. After it is complete it closes the application and comes out. Instead it would be good if again the search box to install further packages is displayed after installing few packages, i.e. go back to the initial view in the application again."  


####  [#310197: Ability to access proxy settings module from the Software manager module in YaST](https://features.opensuse.org/310197)


"Add a menu-item (or some other way if that is more viable) to access the proxy settings module from the Software Management in YaST. In places where you can only access the network after you specify a proxy, the typical first run of the software management module typically launched from the main-menu in all the major desktop environments, fails (unless you have the foresight to know of proxy module in YaST-control-centre and configure it from there first) and starts up showing only installed packages. At this time a user will search for a proxy-configuration tool within the installer interface, because all his/her favourite network applications (firefox, evolution, pidgin, etc.) have proxy configuration options of their own (as well as the ability to pick up system defaults of course). (...)"  


####  [#310199: Repository Announcements](https://features.opensuse.org/310199)


"I often read announcements in Mailing Lists that repositories are renamed, deleted or whatever. Especially in the KDE repos there is currently much restructuration ongoing.  I propose to implement a feature in libzypp and its GUIs to be able to show important announcements for each repository.  Ideally, multiple repositories can issue one common announcement which will be displayed only once."  


####  [#310201: Include a pastebin script in the distribution](https://features.opensuse.org/310201)


"It would help tremendously if we would include a pastebin script (e.g. pastebinit, which is in network:utilities and Contrib) in the stock distribution. Given that it is really small, we ought to include it in the core patterns (i.e. always install it). (...)"  


####  [#310205: using slocate instead of locate](https://features.opensuse.org/310205)


"maybe it would be a good idea to use slocate as default in findutils-locate package. it may called findutils-slocate.  here are the reasons why i think we should use this: (...)"  


####  [#310225: VLC in opensuse](https://features.opensuse.org/310225)


"VLC is a great media player, it awesome, and it will be good, to add like a default media player in opensuse 11.4, because, VLC can play any type of video without codecs.  Totem and Kaffeine have problems with codecs because the licence, but VLC doesnt have problem with licence."  


####  [#310228: TouchScreens support](https://features.opensuse.org/310228)


"Will be mandatory for many pcs like HP TouchSmart products."

####  [Alex Barrios: openSUSE present in the Especial Edition of CIBESS](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/07/19/opensuse-present-in-the-especial-edition-of-cibess/)

###  For Desktop Users





####  [ITWorld/Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols: Linux First Steps](http://www.itworld.com/operating-systems/113296/linux-first-steps)


"Every now and again someone writes me and asks me "What's the best way for me to get started in Linux?" Over the years, I've answered in several different ways, but here's the summarization of my thoughts.  First, most of the people who write me aren't interested in the fine details of Linux. They are just sick and tired to death of Windows' endless security problems or its costs. Indeed, most of them aren't that interested in learning Linux. They just want a cheap operating system that will let them read e-mail, browse the Web, and run some office applications without worrying about malware. "

"Often, when modelling in 3D, it™s necessary to create a backdrop panoramic image. Typically this shows sky and distant land which should appear behind the foreground action. One place we™ll need this for the pilot to Lunatics is for the sky in Baikonur, Kazakhstan on launch day at the beginning of the story.

###  For Commandline/Script Newbies





####  [python4kids: WhyPy?](http://python4kids.wordpress.com/2010/07/09/whypy/)


"Python is a computer programming language. It is named after the comedy act Monty Python (not after the snake of the same name). It was created by a mathematician called Guido van Rossum. Python is called a scripting language because what is typed by the programmer can be run directly by the computer. Unlike some other programming languages, Python programs do not need to be compiled before they work (actually they do, but the computer does it without you noticing)."  


####  [Sander Marechal: Resizing images with correct gamma using PHP and GD](http://www.jejik.com/articles/2010/07/resizing_images_with_correct_gamma_using_php_and_gd/)


"A short while ago Ty W posted an [interesting question on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3303639/php-gd2-how-to-maintain-alpha-channel-transparency-and-correct-gamma). Apparently, most graphics software [cannot scale images the right way](http://www.4p8.com/eric.brasseur/gamma.html). Usually it's hard to notice the flaw but the linked article does a great job of explaining the problem.  PHP's GD library suffers from the same issue, but Ty discovered that the sample PHP program provided with the article did not work on partially transparent images. After a couple of hours of fiddling I managed to get a working solution."

"Let™s admit it, writing applications is a complex thing to do; it requires lot of blood and sweat. After putting so much effort into creating an application it would be shame to see it not being used just because it was only available in English. The bottom line is; most people pay more attention and give more respect to a product which is available in their own language. By its very nature, open source software qualifies as some of the most translated on the planet. If you want to seek a global audience for your software, it is very important that you localise your application for your users. Here™s how¦"

####  [Linux User & Developer/Koen Vervloesem: Ruby for system administrators](http://www.linuxuser.co.uk/news/ruby-for-system-administrators/)


"Most Linux and UNIX system administrators use a diverse mix of shell scripts and tools like grep, awk, cut and so on. The classical approach has proven its merits, but these scripts are generally not easy to read or to maintain. One solution is to use a real programming language for system administration tasks. In a complex environment, system administration can become much easier with a real programming language instead of shell scripts. Traditionally, Perl has been very popular among sysadmins, but some people maintain that this is not much better than shell. (...)"

"Because I travel a lot for my job, I looked for a portable alternative to my DELL XPS M2010. As nice as the huge display was “ the 20³ machine was just unsuited as cabin bagge or for mobile usage.

"In my last posting, I mentioned that my notebook eats by far more battery when running Linux / KDE than running Windows 7. Even though I identified (and fixed) that this was due to the switchable graphics (both cards were running and sucking power), I was eager to optimize the power consumption. After some research, I came up with the following solution.  I put several energy-savign tweaks into a script, saved it to /usr/local/sbin/powersave.sh and added an entry in sudoers for it because it requires root privileges. I can run the script now with sudo but without having to enter the root password thus allowing the KDE energy manager Powerdevil to run the script automatically. Therefore, I added the following custom call to the Powersave profile in Powerdevil˜s settings: sudo /usr/local/sbin/powersave.sh (...)"

But now as Factory is open again and we all have our systems updated to openSUSE 11.3, we™re ready to break Factory again (hopefully not).

There's certainly value in the actual distcheck process to ensure you have a sane build, but why actually distribute the tarball? What's the meaningful difference between a tarball and a git tag?  Now, I won't even touch on the subject of how badly I want to throw autotools in the trash, but we're so entrenched in its ways, and are comfortable with its quirks that energy is better spent on actual improvements, so for now the distcheck process is here to stay.

"Since we relesed 3.98.x on mid-May we have devoted most of our effort to remove the last pieces of Qt3Support from KMyMoney. We are almost there, and we will be probably releasing a stable version sometime mid-August. The final date will be decided when we remove the last piece of legacy code, but it will be almost exactly one year after releasing version 1.0.  We have played with the versioning naming scheme a bit, so the stable version will be 4.5, to follow KDE's numbering more closely."

"Hey you all. I would first like to thank all of you who have visited this website and looked at the ideas I have posted. I am deeply honored that many of you too have considered these ideas worthwhile and would like to see them implemented.  Well, here comes a good one I think. As I was talking to some people on the KDE IRC channel yesterday, there was a comment made about a possible way to orient new KDE users on how to use the desktop. However, I believe that users should be left clues to discover their desktop on their own. There should not be an intro popup or anything like that. Ponder about this for a moment. (...)"

"One of the great advantages of using a free license for a work is that you can re-use a growing body of free-licensed source material to help you do it. But it can seem a little daunting to find the material that you both want and can legally use. Here™s a little bit of my strategy, a few tips, and some sources, including Jamendo, which I found to be the most useful for finding music. I also touch upon some useful free software tools for listening and sorting tracks. (...)"  


####  [Make Tech Easier/Tavis J. Hampton: How to Configure Linux for Children](http://maketecheasier.com/configure-linux-for-children/2010/07/21)


"Many people still cling to the notion that Linux is for 30-year-old male geeks.

"The last time we looked at openSUSE was back in October of last year. It™s been a long haul for the SUSE community between versions, not just in terms of the effort to do the coding, but also in terms of the way the openSUSE community has been handling itself in general in relation to its peers."  


####  [h-online/Andrea Müller: What's new in openSUSE 11.3](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/What-s-new-in-openSUSE-11-3-1039789.html)


"openSUSE 11.3 has arrived with heaps of advancements. In this feature we take a look at such features as the newly added lean LXDE desktop, the new package repository functions and the installation option for netbooks.  Don't be deceived by the version number: although the figure doesn't end in a 0, openSUSE 11.3 has a range of new features to offer “ improved netbook support, a newly added desktop environment and additional package repository functions are only some of them. Before the official release date, the openSUSE team provided us with the gold master so that we could try out the new functions before the official public release."
