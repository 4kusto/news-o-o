[openSUSE 11.2 has reached end of SUSE support - 11.2 Evergreen goes on!](http://lists.opensuse.org/archive/opensuse-security-announce/2011-05/msg00003.html)

With the release of a kdelibs4 security fix on Thursday 12th of May SUSE has released the
      last update for openSUSE 11.2. 

openSUSE 11.2 is now officially discontinued and out of support by SUSE. 

However the openSUSE Evergreen community effort is going to continue the openSUSE 11.2
      maintenance similar to 11.1. 

The overview page of this project, how to activate and use it, and other details, is
        on:[http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen) The Evergreen project is lead by openSUSE
      community member Wolfgang Rosenauer.

Here are some security statistics: openSUSE 11.2 was released on November 12th 2009,
      making it 18 months of security and bugfix support. 

Some statistics on the released patches (compared to 11.1, which had 7 months
      more):

(As comparison would otherwise be difficult due to the different lifetimes, I did adjust
      the 11.1 numbers by *18/25)

  * Total updates: 489 (-19)

  * Security: 317 (-19)

  * Recommended: 172 (+ 3)

  * Optional: 0 (- 3)

          [Sebastian Kügler: What™s new in Plasma Active?](http://vizzzion.org/blog/2011/05/whats-new-in-plasma-active/)
        

We™ve been busy bees in the growing Plasma Active team, so it™s time to post some
          progress updates. In case you forgot, Plasma Active is a KDE project to create a desirable
          user experience for the device spectrum, with its first focus to create a system suitable
          for tablet computers. In my [first post](http://vizzzion.org/blog/2011/04/plasma-active-a-desirable-user-experience-encompassing-the-device-spectrum/) about Plasma Active, you can see the basic shell running on a 10
          inch Viewsonic Viewtab. In this post, I™m using a Wetab to demo the current state of
          Plasma Active. The Wetab is one of our test devices. It™s a nice target device since it™s
          Intel Atom-based, which makes building Plasma Active a bit easier, and thus shortens our
          development-testing-deployment cycles considerable. The Wetab can currently be gotten from
          German Ebay for 219âƒ½ + shipping, so it™s also quite affordable. 

Back to the software, though. Our focus in the past weeks has been two-fold, we™ve
          done a lot of small fixes which greatly improve the user experience. The other class of
          changes is less visible at this point, but still fun and exciting. (...)

          [Aaron Seigo: Qt5 .. KDE5?](http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2011/05/qt5-kde5.html)
        

As most of those who read my blog have already heard, [Qt5 is on its way](http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2011/05/09/thoughts-about-qt-5/). The target is 2012 and the focus is QtQuick where there is a high degree of
          separation between display and data and things are rendered using a hardware accelerated
          (read: OpenGL) scene graph. This is very much in line with where we are heading with
          Plasma as well. Exciting times!

What does this mean for KDE? Will there be a KDE5 in 2012 as well? What would a KDE5
          look like? I know these are the questions on some of your minds, if only because some of
          you have already started asking myself and others about it. ;)

The short answer is that we don't know yet, but we're working on it. Not a very
          satisfying answer is it? Well, short answers are rarely much fun. So here's the slightly
          longer version.

[Thanasis Rous: Medical Report](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-medical/2011-05/msg00008.html)

Report from FOSSCOMM (Patras,Greece) Conference 

As a distro tester and openSUSE Ambassador, I 'm very happy to report what took place
          in the conference (it was my first conference as an ambassador and member of openSUSE
          Medical Team)

So the conference lasted 2 days

**1st Day : Booth and presentation**

We set up the booth as an openSUSE Community. All the related stuff (about Medical and
          openSUSE) was available around the booth. 

Furthermore me and Stathis Iosifidis we presented the openSUSE Medical project as well
          as the applications which are available via the openSUSE Medical Distro.

I would like to note that we presented the following applications :

  * openEMR

  * GNUMed

  * FreeMedForms

  * FreeDiams

  * TEMPO

And finally we presented the new application for diabetics (which is available in the
          medical repository) " plasmoid-glucose "

The presentation is available at: [http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28782593/opensuse_medical_FOSSCOMM2011_001.odp](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28782593/opensuse_medical_FOSSCOMM2011_001.odp)

The presentation was really interesting, people (doctors)Ã½during the presentation
          asked us about the distro, the project and how to setup and use the applications in
          general.

**2nd Day : Feedback and Booth support**

During the second day , we informed the people (via the booth) about the openSUSE
          Medical project and it's applications and features. Many people asked us about the aim of
          the project, and how to use the application. 

In addition with the questions people were surprised with the whole idea of the
          project and that are able to use this kind of applications as FOSS software.

According to me it's very important to present and show the openSUSE Medical project
          to doctors and students, because this project will be alive only with the collaboration of
          developers and medical students+doctors.

**Feedback :**

Something new for a FOSS conference , many people are interested in this
          project!

You can take a look at the photos of the presentation and the booth as well :

I wanted to open a fate feature about this when I first heard of plymouth, but
            reading
            http://fedoramagazine.wordpress.com/2008/10/21/interview-fedora-10s-better-startup/
            really makes me think we should go this way.

Ray's comment starting with "Every flicker and mode change in the boot
            process takes away from the whole experience." is especially interesting. Is it
            okay to track the "don't show grub by default" here?

            [Replacement for Sax2 (Score: 129)](https://features.opensuse.org/308357)
          

We need a replacement for sax2 in 11.3, as a safety measure for when auto

            [Update to GRUB v2 (Score: 120)](https://features.opensuse.org/308497)
          

Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn't
            going to go away. The code itself isn't well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It's only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don't have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

We need a feedback about packages that are preferred by users and actively used. Debian already has a tool named Popularity contest (popcon)

            [make yast gtk gui more complete](https://features.opensuse.org/312308)
          

The yast2 qt interface have (at least) one very usefull function that is not found in the gtk interface: when there is a problem in an install, being able to force reinstall of all the already installed packages is very handy.


In qt, it's enough to clic right and select update all the selected.



so I would be fine to have the same in gtk (I just had a corrupted kde4 install and could only run gnome)

            [Fix Printing in SuSe by Having gutenprint](https://features.opensuse.org/312309)
          

On Ubuntu there are many many printer drivers on the distribution by default because of the package gutenprint . SuSe has this package in the Repos, but not default. When I tried to set up my printer, nothing but the generic driver was found, but I manually installed gutenprint after 3 hours of searching on Google, and the Driver was there. gutenprint should be there by default.






            [don't install postfix by default anymore](https://features.opensuse.org/312320)
          

postfix slows down system boot and runs on every installation even though it's not actually needed anymore on the average desktop. Even mutt can send mails without local mta nowadays. Therefore we shouldn't install postfix anymore by default.



cron may need adjustments to report output of cron jobs via other means such as syslog.






            [cups-pdf Drucker wieder per default installieren](https://features.opensuse.org/312322)
          

I think that openSUSE should install a pdf-printer as default again.

            [allow configuration of offline local printer](https://features.opensuse.org/312327)
          

Now it's impossible to configure a local printer is it's not detectedn why?






            [Provide gccgo packages](https://features.opensuse.org/312333)
          

It would be awesome to ship gcc 4.6 with support for Google Go (gccgo) with openSUSE 12.1.



Debian already provides gccgo for sid: [http://packages.debian.org/sid/gccgo](http://packages.debian.org/sid/gccgo)






            [Installing video card drivers from the official](https://features.opensuse.org/312334)
          

While searching through many pages of information about Linux and OpenSUSE that I found complaining. For the installation of graphics card drivers from the manufacturer. These appear in the repository often result in errors and critical system states.


I think that when you install an option I should be asking whether to install the drivers or compile a formal closed. When chosen to be the official drivers are able to download the script itself from the pack, and compile the relevant modules into the kernel. Also, the appropriate settings in the xorg configuration. This is mainly on the users complain that they used Ubuntu.

[Jos Poortvliet: Events - LinuxTag and HCC linux themadag](http://blog.jospoortvliet.com/2011/05/events-linuxtag-and-hcc-linux-themadag.html)

I'll be going to two **VERY** different events this month:
        Linux Tag with thousands of visitors and [a big openSUSE team](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:LinuxTag) and the [Dutch HCC Linux Themadag](http://groepen.hcc.nl/home/hccplatform-linux-home/1077-hcclinuxthemadag-2011.html) which I expect to be slightly smaller - by a factor of 10 or so.

![](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4153/5105017522_6cf053a9d1.jpg)

I'm not really sure what kind of event I like most. At LinuxTag I'll probably be more
        busy to talk to people who know a fair bit about Free Software, get interviewed, discuss
        things with other FOSS people in many one-on-one or small meetings etcetera. At HCC, well,
        there will be few people I know and most visitors are probably quite new to Linux. I really
        look forward to meeting the dutch openSUSE people (most of whom I don't know yet) and yes, I
        always enjoy talking to newbies. But LinuxTag has lots of friends, both from within openSUSE
        and from other projects - that's also awesome. 

I think I'm gonna decide that they're both equally cool. 

And if you live close to either, be sure to be there & say hi to me! 

If you want to pick me out of the crowd, a helpful tip: my hair (both on head &
        chin) got a bit longer since the pic above was taken!

[Michal ÄŒihaÅ™: StarDict dictionaries for openSUSE](http://blog.cihar.com/archives/2011/05/09/stardict-dictionaries-opensuse/)

While [working](http://blog.cihar.com/archives/2011/05/09/no-new-dictionaries-tarballs-no-change/) on [dictionaries for
        StarDict](http://cihar.com/software/slovnik/) today, I've decided to finally bring them to openSUSE as well.

First step was to fix my favorite tool to access them - sdcv. The fixed package is now in
      my home project and will be hopefully soon accepted to Education project so that it is more
      visible (see [request 69901](https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/69901)
      if it is already the case).

When I had the tool working, it was time to package [dictionaries](http://cihar.com/software/slovnik/) themselves. It was quite
      simple task and the rpms are available in [my home
        project](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=home%3ANijel%3Astardict).

To install packages on openSUSE 11.4 simply
      do:

\stardict

[Holger Hetterich: SMB Traffic Analyzer 1.2.4 supports multiple databases and delivers
        webSMBTA](http://holger123.wordpress.com/2011/05/08/smb-traffic-analyzer-1-2-4-supports-multiple-databases-and-delivers-websmbta/)

If you don™t have a clue what you are reading here, this article is about the** SMB Traffic Analyzer** project, check it™s [homepage](http://holger123.wordpress.com/smb-traffic-analyzer/) for more
      information about it.

The development team is proud to announce the release of **version
        1.2.4 of SMB Traffic Analyzer**. With a much longer development cycle than usual,
      we took the time to do real ground work on** SMBTA**, and
      reworked the whole database handling. As a result, SMBTA will from now on access it™s
      databases via [libDBI](http://libdbi.sourceforge.net/), a generic database
      layer. Via libDBI, **SMBTA** is potientially able to run with
        **sqlite, MySQL, and postgresql** as database backend. Since
      both, smbtad and smbtatools have been rewritten to use the libDBI layer, smbtaquery can know
      run completely independent from smbtad, as it uses** libDBI**
      directly to access the database (**bso#8065**). We have tried
      hard to crash smbtad in test suites since we made the move to **libDBI**, and moved **several tens of
          terabyte** over samba shares without getting smbtad to fall (we are
      currently using** postgresql** as database). We strongly believe,
      since smbtad does not have to function as a network gateway to the database for the clients
      any more, the move to libDBI will make SMB Traffic Analyzer much more stable. SMB Traffic
      Analyzer 1.2.4 provides an upgrade path if the user wants to use the sqlite database that has
      been created with SMBTA version <= 1.2.3.

FigureÂ 1.Â The object selector of webSMBTA

<td >![The object selector of webSMBTA](http://holger123.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/bildschirmfoto.png)
</td></tr></table>

  


Furthermore,** SMB Traffic Analyzer 1.2.4** debuts **Benjamin Brunner™s** work on
        **webSMBTA**, a web
      interface to all functions of the **smbtaquery** program. It is a
      modern, rails3 based, intuitive interface, that **reduces** object selection **to a few mouse clicks**, and makes running statistic
      functions on the objects a breeze. **webSMBTA** automatically
      retrieves all the objects known in your Samba network, and displays them in a way that gives
      an idea of the network structure. Out of these lists, you click the object you want to run a
      function on, and get a descriptive dialog for the function™s options. The output of functions
      is HTML rendered, and attached to the webSMBTA main page. Our ground work on XML in smbtaquery
      finally pays off, as **webSMBTA** is consuming **HTML output** of smbtaquery
      directly. Once a function has been chosen, it can easily be re-run by clicking it™s reload
        button,**** or removed from the
      page.

We have added a new chapter for the documentation on **webSMBTA,** as well as to the **libDBI**
      change.

All of smbtatools can now use a single configuration file, serving all of them (**bso#8097**). The top function of smbtaquery can now operate
      descending as well as ascending. (**bso#8095**).

You can download **SMB Traffic Analyzer** from the [download page](http://holger123.wordpress.com/smb-traffic-analyzer/smb-traffic-analyzer-download/). Please be aware that currently binary packages of smbtatools 1.2.4
      do **not** contain the code for webSMBTA, as webSMBTA is in Beta,
      has not yet been employed with Apache, and is not ready for being packaged. Of course, the
      1.2.4 source tarball of smbtatools does contain the webSMBTA sources. Nevertheless, you can
      find a README file in the smbtatools tarball, describing how to run the webinterface by using
      the internal rails webserver. For more information on **SMB Traffic

[Nelson Marques: Unknown Horizons, a nice strategy game, now on openSUSE](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/05/09/unknown-horizons-a-nice-strategy-game-now-on-opensuse/)

A few days ago I was wandering on the [openSUSE
        Forums](http://forums.opensuse.org), once more in the games section when I saw one more post from one of our
      users asking for [Unknown Horizons](http://www.unknown-horizons.org)¦ I™ve
      search a bit and found 2 entries on OBS ([openSUSE Build
        Service](http://build.opensuse.org)), one for Fedora packages and another for openSUSE packages.

I™ve joined #unknown-horizons on [FreeNode](irc://irc.opensuse.org) and
      found out that Unknown Horizons is very active and people are very nice. I™ve made a few
      questions around and offered myself to package this nice game for openSUSE
      (home:ketheriel:UnknownHorizons). Some of the dependencies are provided by the games
      repository, to which I want to submit the major releases, and if possible enable builds for
      Fedora (and friends).

A few packages need some tweaks to enable builds for Fedora (allegro, libenet, guichan),
      and I™m working already on that. Meanwhile for everyone who wants to check out the latest
      development snapshot of Unknown Horizons, feel free to do so¦ Currently packaged for:

  * openSUSE 11.3

  * openSUSE 11.4

  * openSUSE Factory

  * openSUSE Tumbleweed

Linus Torvalds released the seventh pre-release of Linux 2.6.39 on Monday night. He wrote:

There are many times as a database developer and administrator that you'll want to know what entities are being excluded from a straight table join. For instance, it would be instructive for management to identify sales people who haven't received any bonuses, as these might be deemed to be the underperformers. To provide the requestor with the statistics, you'll have to determine which sales people are absent from the bonuses table. This is commonly referred to as a Non-matching query, although it is sometimes called a Subtract or Set Difference query as well. MySQL provides not one but three standard means of producing non-matching results. I will be presenting each here, along with another that you might not have considered. (...)

        [DevX.com/Jason Gilmore: Mono Development 101: Build Linux Desktop Apps with .NET](http://www.devx.com/opensource/Article/46936)
      

I've spent the majority of my career focused entirely on open source Web development, having only occasionally dabbled in .NET development. Of course, the great thing about the open source community is that if you do happen to need a particular application, chances are somebody else has already created it. But what if it doesn't exist, or if an existing application doesn't work precisely as you believe it should?



I recently encountered this very problem when searching for streaming radio applications (plenty such applications exist, I just don't like any of them), and concluded that perhaps the only way to scratch this particular itch was to build my own application. This decision immediately prompted two questions: how in the heck are Linux desktop applications built in the first place, and could I harness my minimal .NET experience in the process?



As it turns out, there are quite a few open source solutions, but one in particular happens to be .NET-specific. That solution is [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page), an open source, cross platform C# implementation. In this article I'll document how I've begun using Mono. (...)

[Jos
        Poortvliet: Code of Conduct or anti-harassment policy](http://blog.jospoortvliet.com/2011/05/code-of-conduct-or-anti-harassment.html)

I went to LCA 2011 in Januari. There, [a
        'mild controvercy' (or rather 'nuclear war') developed](http://lwn.net/Articles/425661/) around a [keynote](http://linuxconfau.blip.tv/file/4851926) by [Mark Pesce](http://www.cultofmarkpesce.com/) and [how
        it was handled](http://www.techworld.com.au/article/374877/pesce_sorry_raunchy_pics_linux_conf_au/) by the conference team. Now personally, I had little issue with
      Mark's keynote. Ok, there was some harsh language and some explicit imagery, but nothing that
      offended me. So when an apology was made during the closing
      ceremony, I was suprised and later on spoke out with some others against the
      'censorship'.

**Changing mind**

But after a while I realized that the point of all this isn't about censorship or Freedom
      of Speech (vs freedom of 'not being insulted'). Those issues surely play in the wider, public
      area. I don't want to have laws which allow our government to prosecute anyone who talks about
      something they don't like! But that is not relevant here. LCA is NOT a public place. It is a
      conference organized by a team which has **EVERY** right to tell
      us under what condictions we can join! It is **their
      conference**, after all. And yes, one of those conditions is that we are supposed to
      watch what we say so we ensure a welcoming place for everyone. 

As I've already been convinced that we **do** need to think
      about diversity, openness and anti-harassment after reading [this LWN article about the darker side of open source
        conferences by Valerie Aurora](http://lwn.net/Articles/417952/), I've decided to draft up a Code of Conduct for the

[Michael Meeks: LibreOffice is the future of Free Software Office suites](http://people.gnome.org/~michael/blog/2011-05-09-libreoffice-fud.html)

This is of course my view, and I hope yours, but naturally it is worth presenting at least
      some rational and working for this conclusion. Unfortunately, there are **so** many reasons why TDF and LibreOffice are done right, that I can't list them
      all in linear time. However, I'll try to address some of the major ones recently raised by
      congenital worriers. 

**LibreOffice is vendor neutral**

LibreOffice does not belong to any single vendor, neither is it a single vendor's product.
      To characterise it that way is just silly. We have full-time developers from Novell, RedHat,
      Canonical and Lanedo working currently, with many key volunteer contributors, and
      contributions from other companies and distributions eg. CodeThink's Unity integration work,
      or the many Google Summer of Code students we've enjoyed working with. No-one is excluded from
      our governance - oh, except over-dominant corporations, there are strict limits in our [bylaws](http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/CommunityBylaws) on the proportion of
      representation (one third) that any single company can have in any of our key institutions.
      Elections will be by a fair method (Single Transferable Vote), and be participated in by all
      significant contributors equally. The contrast with the mess of ridiculously gerrymandered
      governance, with layers of stacked privilege given to a single corporation in a previous
      project is quite stark. 

SUSE is the largest corporate contributor to TDF, though we are small compared to our huge
      group of motivated volunteers. My aim is to ensure that no vendor dominates (including SUSE):
      and that there is room for all contributors. Looking at our structures: the Steering
      Committee, Membership Committee, and the Engineering Steering Committee, we seem to be doing
      well there. 

Of course, having vendor neutrality around open standards is also good, but this is
      someone else's fight. I'm interested in the best result Free Software implementation possible,
      with a fun community to stand behind it, rather than the different good of enabling
      competition between implementations. (...)

      In most linuces the developpers spent lots of time and energy to improve boottime and startup time of applications. Work has been done to the kernel, we have systemd and the desktop environment developpers have done their share too. The last couple of years we've also seen the introduction of Solid State Disks, "disks" based on memory cards, instead of turning platters. One of the main advantages of these SSDs is that their access for reading and writing is much faster than the traditional HDD's, so booting and starting applications should be faster, and indeed is faster. Disadvantage is the difference in price per GB of storage. Recently less expensive SSDs have appeared on the market, our admin oldcpu is asking people to share their experiences.

Indeed, other than cutting Novell™s work-force by 25%, Attachmate has said little concrete about the company™s open-source plans. I have learned from sources though that [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/), the open-source office suite, will continue to receive [Novell](http://www.novell.com/)™s support. (...)

        [Christoph Feck: Troubleshooting kded4 Bugs](http://kdepepo.wordpress.com/2011/05/11/troubleshooting-kded4-bugs/)
      

Not just recently, but as long as KDE exists, we are getting bug reports for the KDE
        process kded4. These include:

  * kded4 crashes

  * kded4 leaks memory

  * kded4 eats 100% CPU

  * kded4 <defunct> process

Before I dive into troubleshooting those problems, let me explain what kded4 does and
        how it works. (...)

        [Datamation/Bruce Byfield: Are Usability Studies Hurting the Free Desktop?](http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/3933061/Are-Usability-Studies-Hurting-the-Free-Desktop.htm)
      

The recent history of new interfaces on the free desktop is not a happy one. Three years ago, the release of KDE 4.0 resulted in a user revolt whose like had never been seen. This year, the [releases](http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/3930571/Ubuntu-Unity-vs-GNOME-3-Which-is-Better.htm) of GNOME 3 and Ubuntu's Unity have produced similar revolts, but on a smaller scale.



Looking at these reactions, I am starting to wonder: Are the developers of free desktops become obsessed with design principles at the expense of what users actually want? (...)

        [QT Labs/Lars Knoll:
          Thoughts about Qt 5](http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2011/05/09/thoughts-about-qt-5/)
      

Qt 4.0 was released in June 2005, almost six years ago. A lot has changed in the
        software industry over these years. While application development back then happened mostly
        on desktop systems, mobile devices connected to the web have become increasingly popular.
        User interface technology has moved from static widgets to a fluid touch based experience.
        Since Qt 4.0 we have released seven minor versions of Qt to stay ahead of development needs,
        for example by releasing Qt Quick. Within the growing Qt user base, we have had a strong
        up-take and new needs from embedded and mobile app and UI developers.

To also, in the future, be a leading edge development framework across multiple
        industries, Qt needs to continue to renew itself. Qt 4 has been an evolution, and I have
        been thinking about what future Qt versions might look like from a technical perspective.
        Over the last years we have been working on laying the foundations for the next major
        release. I see Qt Quick, QML Scenegraph and Project Lighthouse“ combined with an increased
        focus on Qt Webkit “ as the foundation which we plan to use to move towards a new major
        release of Qt.

Given that Qt is moving into open governance mode in the upcoming months, I wanted to
        share my thinking with the Qt community in order to kick off the discussions about what I
        see as the technical architecture for Qt 5. (...)

### Warning!



[JP Rosevear:
        WebGL](http://blog.jprosevear.org/2011/05/13/webgl-security/)

Recently Context Information Security Limited gathered a lot of attention for [a blog post on the state of WebGL
        security](http://contextis.co.uk/resources/blog/webgl/). For Mozilla, [WebGL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL) was first released in Firefox 4, and there are implementations in Chrome,
        Safari and Opera as well. The blog post outlines an abstract concern that WebGL is
        inherently insecure because it allows fairly direct access to the hardware, along with two
        specific attacks, a Denial of Service and a Cross-Domain Image Theft.

The Denial of Service attack does not generally endanger user data or privacy, but it
        can be highly annoying for users, not unlike sites that pop up multiple dialogs or have
        long-running javascript that hangs the browser. The Khronos WebGL working group has been
        aware of this type of issue for some time and has discussed it openly. Shader validation can
        help somewhat, as can [GL_ARB_robustness](http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/robustness.txt), but the forthcoming GL_ARB_robustness_2 extension will help
        even more. There are also user confirmation approaches available as well depending on what
        real world data we uncover over time. (...)
