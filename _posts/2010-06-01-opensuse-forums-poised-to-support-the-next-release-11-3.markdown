With a good selection of Forum users already working with openSUSE's development version of the next openSUSE release 11.3 -  The forums will be a great place to stop for support post install of the official release.
Members are currently working hard testing and bug reporting on 11.3 Milestone 7 - This can only make for a better final release. Going by the performance of 11.3 so far, it's going to be a super release. Most of the Forum Team are already well involved with testing and helping members troubleshoot issues. This will make for a well prepared body of helpers for when the release is final.
