![Tumbleweed-black]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Tumbleweed-black-300x127.png)Four snapshots released this week provided plenty of new packages for openSUSE Tumbleweed users, but what is coming in a future snapshot is what has people excited.

[Python 3.5.1](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-351/) and [Linux Kernel 4.4.4](https://www.linux.com/news/software/linux-kernel/890325-linux-kernel-444-officially-released) are expected to be updated this week in Tumbleweed snapshots.

[Plasma 5.5.5](https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.5.5.php) released earlier this week in [snapshot 20160303](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-03/msg00052.html) also has people excited.

[Snapshot 20160304](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-03/msg00065.html) provided updates for [YaST](http://yast.github.io/), [Kiwi](https://opensuse.github.io/kiwi/) and perl-bootloader. [Snapshot 20160305](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-03/msg00067.html) provided updated packages for [DigiKam](https://www.digikam.org/) and systemd rpm macros. [Snapshot 20160307](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-03/msg00099.html) had the most diverse updates to grub2, libzypp, Plasma Frameworks, [xen](http://www.xenproject.org/) and [Samba](https://www.samba.org/).

In other news related to the project, Ludwig Nussel, who is the new release manager for openSUSE Leap, is drafting a release schedule for Leap 42.2 and is expected to brief that at the [openSUSE Conference](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC16) in Nuremberg this June.
