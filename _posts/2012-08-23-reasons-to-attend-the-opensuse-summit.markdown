## Geeko Lounge


openSUSE Geekos are a hard working creature.Â  But that doesn't mean we can't take time to stop and enjoy the moment.Â  The Geeko Lounge will remain open for the entire weekend.Â  Plop your dupa down on our comfortable sofas and bean bags while enjoying a nice Continental Breakfast.Â  Or come in for a quick refreshment and socialize with fellow Geekos when you need a break from the hustlle and bustle of a busy day checking out our sessions.
