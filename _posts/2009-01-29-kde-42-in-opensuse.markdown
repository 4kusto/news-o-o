The KDE Project [released KDE 4.2 on Tuesday](//kde.org/announcements/4.2/index.php), and of course openSUSE packages were available in time for the release. If you missed the pointer from the KDE announcement [info page](//kde.org/info/4.2.0.php), you can get your KDE 4.2 fix in a number of ways.

Want to install KDE 4.2 on an existing system? Grab the packages via one-click install for [openSUSE 11.1](//download.opensuse.org/repositories/KDE:/KDE4:/Factory:/Desktop/openSUSE_11.1/KDE4-BASIS.ymp), [openSUSE 11.0](//download.opensuse.org/repositories/KDE:/KDE4:/Factory:/Desktop/openSUSE_11.0/KDE4-BASIS.ymp), or [openSUSE 10.3](//download.opensuse.org/repositories/KDE:/KDE4:/Factory:/Desktop/openSUSE_10.3/KDE4-BASIS.ymp).

You can also run the 4.2 packages in a Live CD, or install a fresh openSUSE 11.1-based system with KDE 4.2 packages from the Live CD found under [//home.kde.org/~binner/kde-four-live/](//home.kde.org/~binner/kde-four-live/). You'll find x86 and x86_64 ISOs there.

Thanks much to our KDE gurus for having this ready! If you want to run 4.2, no need to wait another minute -- grab the packages and have a lot of fun!

**Update: Please note that these packages _are not supported_.** The KDE team has packaged these for openSUSE users who want to get their hands on KDE 4.2 quickly, but the packages are not supported.
