As part of a [Novell Open Audio](http://www.novell.com/feeds/openaudio) series on openSUSE, they will be interviewing various openSUSE developers to find out more about the project, particular involvements and new technologies in the distribution. [Today's interview](http://www.novell.com/feeds/openaudio/?p=180) features a talk with [Martin Lasarsch](http://en.opensuse.org/User:Mlasars), an openSUSE evangelist. He extensively goes over the changes in openSUSE 10.3, highlighting all the nice improvements along the way.

The episode also features a talk with no fewer than 10 of the core openSUSE developers, as they provide insight into the openSUSE releases and how things like the numbering of our releases work.
