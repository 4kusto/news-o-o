As part of their openSUSE release series, Novell Open Audio [has talked to](http://www.novell.com/feeds/openaudio/?p=186) Michael Schr√∂der and Andreas Bauer about the [openSUSE Build Service](http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service), our powerful cross-distribution package build system. They discuss a bunch of updates which happened over the year since last coverage, what is being worked on currently and a little bit on how you can have your projects hosted on the service.
