####  [Sirko Kemter: Improve artwork openSUSE 11.4](//karl-tux-stadt.de/ktuxs/?p=2677)


"It was a little bit quiet about that topic last days, thats because I had a little bit other work to do. The only thing I did now for the installer is, to make deliberations which pages are needed and helpful in the slideshow. More I cant do at this time. A generally background is needed first. I did some wallpaper but I found no really idea, one of them looke like a commercial for lemonade, there was some the liked it but me self not."  


####  [Sirko Kemter: Graphical improvements for 11.4](//karl-tux-stadt.de/ktuxs/?p=2685)


"Some days ago, I showed some of the wallpaper proposals they Ivan Cukic made for openSUSE 11.4. I think they are not the final version but we got good feedback for them and I think they will happen in 11.4. So I played a little bit with them how it could look in generally with the installer, splash and so on. I choosed the grey version because grey is neutral color. And when u come from splash to the windowmanager there changes not the green and it looks very different. So look and tell me what u think. And of course its not final and I have, to make some things better."

"After long drives from Nuernberg, Prague and Darmstadt hitting every traffic jam on the A3 (the Czechs won the race), the openSUSE Boosters met up in the little rhenish town of Sankt Augustin near Bonn to attend FrOSCon. Last night we reacquainted ourselves with each other and the odd glass of Kölsch or two over steak and chips. Suitably fortified, we are now occupied our project room upstairs at FrOSCon (room C125) and are now hacking like crazy on our team project, a new site for openSUSE users and contributors. This is based on the Elgg free software social networking platform, so we’re dusting off our PHP and looking at all the integration points with the rest of the openSUSE platform: the Build Service, Bugzilla, the wiki, Lizards, and so on. So if you’re more of a web monkey than a distro gibbon and would like to help, drop by tomorrow or just get in touch with the ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿[//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Boosters_team](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Boosters_team)."

"One and a half year is now gone since I posted about my work for ARM support in the OBS and the work for a port of openSUSE to ARM. Lots of things had happened in the meantime that are related, from my limited view most notably Nokia and Intel joining Moblin and Maemo to MeeGo (MeeGo is currently working on a number of Atom and ARM based devices), chosing to use OBS as build system and last but not least myself joining The Linuxfoundation (you will be not surprised to hear that I work at LF on OBS). In the meantime there had also been a major new OBS release 1.8/2.0 with a bunch of new features."

####  [KDE at openSUSE: KDE: Week 26-32](//kdeatopensuse.wordpress.com/2010/08/15/kde-week-26-32/)


"It’s been a while without post, simply because I did not have any issues with my openSUSE or KDE that I could have written about. Meanwhile enough small things have accumulated.  The openSUSE and thus KDE update from 11.2 with KDE from the KDE:Factory repo to 11.3 and its stock KDE packages went smoothly via zypper dup.  The most annoying issues are that the not threadsafe dbus makes dolphin crash and thus look bad. Akonadi is crashing on logout sometimes, yet I could not get a backtrace yet because drkonqi is shut down while collecting it. And using desktop effects locks-up my Intel driven netbook from time to time because of buggy drivers/Xorg/Kernel (three more bugs: 1 – 2 – 3), i.e. not KDE. I wonder how often KDE gets blamed for bugs that are actually due to e.g. buggy graphics drivers or packages not part of KDE."  


####  [Raymond Wooninck: Still alive and kicking !! New snapshots and reorganization for openSUSE’s KDE4:Unstable repository](//tittiatcoke.wordpress.com/2010/08/15/still-alive-and-kicking-new-snapshots-and-reorganization-for-opensuses-kde4unstable-repository/)


"I guess that maybe some people were wondering how come that it was so silence around the Unstable repository for openSUSE. There are two reasons for it. First one is that I have been on holidays and I promised my family that I would stay away from a computer as much as possible. Secondly in August the KDE repositories were changes and optimized. This meant not only a new name and/or location, but also we had a good look at what was provided by each repo.  For the KDE4:Unstable repo it was agreed that the new repo name would be KDE:Unstable:SC and that it should only provide the standard KDE:SC packages with the build-required libraries. This means that application like Amarok, choqok, konversation, etc are no longer provided through this KDE:Unstable:SC repository. SVN snapshot versions of these applications can be found in the new playground (KDE:Unstable:Playground) repo or released version can be retrieved directly from either the openSUSE:Factory repository or in case of an older distribution from the KDE:UpdatedApps repository."

####  [#310338: Always create /root/autoyast.xml for every installation](https://features.opensuse.org/310338)


"Distributions such as RHEL (and any of its blood line) always leave a file /root/anaconda-ks.cfg which can be used to repeat the installation via their anaconda/kickstart process.  The parallel to this with openSUSE is YaST2 and AutoYaST.  The feature request is asking that at the end of every installation in the home directory of the root user the necessary file or files are created to allow the user to repeat the installation with the same options. (...)"  


####  [#310339: Improved KDE integration for GIMP & Inkscape](https://features.opensuse.org/310339)


"GIMP and Inkscape need better integration into KDE, namely its "Open file" dialogue is stuck in GNOME look. Firefox and OpenOffice have their own wrappers, which integrate their corresponding action into KDE. GIMP and Inkscape are programs which would benefit greatly from native KDE image thumbnails."  


####  [#310346: java developer](https://features.opensuse.org/310346)


"Since opensolaris "died" I'm looking for a platform perfectly suitable for java development.  I'd need the last versions of netbeans, mysql + workbench, mercurial + android + open jdk + ORACLE JDK.  All of these components can be installed separately, but I'd like a distribution "one click developer".  Possibly with self - update of the last issues."  


####  [#310357: user settings on installation](https://features.opensuse.org/310357)


"on during the installation process on step "create new user" is doing "Automatic Login" per default on. Even its a laptop and the laptop pattern is choosed from yast automaticly.  it would be a little bit more secure for new user who not know what that means to make that not as default."  


####  [#310364: Add DVD's of each DE](https://features.opensuse.org/310364)


"In openSUSE 10.3, there were CD's that you could use to install openSUSE KDE or GNOME alone. I think it would be great to create individual DVDs for each Deskltop Environment, in addition to the current media, so you can install GNOME and loads of software with it. A KDE user could have 4.7 GB of KDE software that they would use, rather than XFCE, GNOME, and LXDE software they wouldn't use. Same for GNOME users. I would imagine that they had to drop some packes from the distribution to make room for LXDE in 11.3 and KDE 3 in 11.1 and 11.0. This would make installing software convenient for computers without an internet connection."  


####  [#310365: Light CD for older computers](https://features.opensuse.org/310365)


"A "Light CD" of openSUSE would be excellent for older computers. It would be a CD with LXDE, OpenOffice, the SUSE Base system, Test-Install YaST, and some basic tools. With this CD, older computers would be able to run openSUSE at a reasonable speed, have YaST and openSUSE community support\updates, legacy drivers, and some basic tools. With this CD edition avalible for download, you could have openSUSE on every old computer."  


####  [#310377: Make Python 3 the default](https://features.opensuse.org/310377)


"Python 3.0 was released nearly 2 years ago now and has been included in the last two releases of openSUSE. Currently in openSUSE we have a python package which installs Python 2.6 and a python3 package which installs Python 3.1. (...)"  


####  [#310379: SUSE Application Center](https://features.opensuse.org/310379)


"Ubuntu 9.10 had one great new feature in it: the Ubuntu Software Center. It's radically dumped down, clean and uncluttered version of Synaptic. See [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SoftwareCenter](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SoftwareCenter) for throughout description.  It is not intended to replace Synaptic, but to make installing software more accessible. This is definitely something openSUSE needs. YaST is even more powerful than Synaptic, but it's also more cluttered (at least in KDE). Thus, the demand for clearly presented centralized software installation and removal is also larger. I'm proposing, that we bluntly copy Ubuntu Software Center principles and create a native Qt interface for KDE. (...)"  


####  [#310380: grub2 bootonce or bootnext command](https://features.opensuse.org/310380)


"With the possibility of Grub2 being implemented soon as a default boot manager, it would be useful to add to the Grub2 packaging a small script that fully emulates the older grubonce that is provided with openSUSE-11.3 and earlier. (...)"  


####  [#310398: e4defrag](https://features.opensuse.org/310398)


"is necessary that a file system to have a defragmenter, even e4defrag is not finished yet. is a kernel patch which do not affect the users who do not want use it. fedora has it and it is the time to have it opensuse too."

As it was announced, it took part on Beeznest Latino offices and we could meet some people interested on the openSUSE Project. We could also spread the word about the openSUSE distribution, as a replacement for closed source OS's and other known Linux distros. Here in my country, openSUSE isn't well known yet, so we're making the necessary to change this."

"While I'm in the mood for posting solutions to technical problems, here's another. I have a OBD interface cable for my VW Bora so that I can run a piece of software called VCDS (sometimes known as VAG-COM) and read the error codes from my car's ECU. However, when I plug in the cable (it's the USB version), it is usually assigned to COM7. Unfortunately, the VCDS programme only supports COM1-4."

"I just installed openSUSE 11.3 on my desktop computer, and I have to say it's pretty much awesome. Almost everything has worked straight out of the box, including my Wacom graphics tablet and my wireless card. One thing that's been annoying me is that whenever I make a mistake (such as trying to delete some text that isn't there), my computer makes the most almighty buzz. Or maybe it could be described as a belch. It's pretty horrible, however you describe it, and makes me jump out of my skin every time. I think it's supposed to be the System Bell."

"I've been at Novell for two years and a half now, and it's been an interesting ride. I must say I've had two amazing bosses who understand the way I work and who have been really supportive, so that definitely helps! I don't know if Klaas will stand me much longer, though ;-) In addition to that, being part of the Boosters is a good way to be with people as crazy as I am, working on weird stuff like me.  Of course, it has been hard to see good people leave the company in the past few months — they are generally still involved upstream, though, so that's positive :-) But recently, we've been joined by two friends: Frédéric, who's working on SUSE Meego, and Jos, the new openSUSE community manager.

####  [Jos Poortvliet: And what has that dude been doing lately...](//nowwhatthe.blogspot.com/2010/08/and-what-has-that-dude-been-doing.html)


"First of all, thanks for the great welcome to the community! I've received many constructive and nice comments which made me very happy. I really look forward to working with you all over the next months/years/centuries/eons/etc.  As I don't yet have much insight in our community, I am spending the first month on getting to know you all, getting input on what is needed, what is going on etcetera. Besides of course reading up on mail, following discussions on IRC and playing with openSUSE myself I went to the Novell headquarters for a week and spoke with my colleagues there. It was an interesting week - Novell has a deep commitment to openSUSE but there is still a lot to learn from both sides. I hope to be able to bring the parts of Novell which work on and with openSUSE technology a bit closer to the community and will start with the marketing. The marketing team at Novell has a lot of experience talking to corporate partners and I hope we can use their experience for openSUSE. The other way around I think we can help them a lot in spreading the word about the work Novell is doing in the free software area."

####  [Sebastian Kügler: Working Upstream.](//vizzzion.org/blog/2010/08/working-upstream/)


"On the website of an Austrian (no kangaroos!) newspaper, I read an interview with Canonical’s Jono Bacon. In this interview, Jono talks about the process of developing central components of the desktop inside Canonical. The process is basically that Canonical’s design department, Ayatana develops components. When they are finished, they’re offered for inclusion into GNOME, which was not a successful in all cases yet. According to Jono this is "working upstream", explaining that in this context Ayatana is the upstream. GNOME is seen as a provider of components, building blocks for Ubuntu’s user experience.  The definition Jono handles of upstream development is quite different from how it works for me. I can speak of personal and professional experience in this context, as I have been working quite a lot on central components of the Plasma Desktop (and Netbook as well). I have done this work both, as a voluntary contributor in my Free time (pun intended), and continue to do so in my working hours for open-slx. open-slx happens to sell and supports Linux deskop operating systems."

This is the first visible sign of KDE’s use of the Nepomuk Semantic Desktop. Nepomuk is a system that uses metadata throughout the desktop to aid in file search and peer to peer collaboration.

Their technical certifications were the industry's gold standard and offered titles such as Certified Novell Engineer, Master Certified Novell Engineer, Certified Novell Directory Engineer, and Novell Administrator. Just ten years later, the networking giant of the 20th century would find itself in a struggle to maintain relevance in the new millennium. The solution came as a change in strategy that would shift the company's focus from networking technologies to low level software and a new venture into an open sourced operating system of their own.

####  [h-online: Root privileges through Linux kernel bug - Update ](//www.h-online.com/security/news/item/Root-privileges-through-Linux-kernel-bug-Update-1061563.html)


"According to [a report](//www.invisiblethingslab.com/resources/misc-2010/xorg-large-memory-attacks.pdf) written by Rafal Wojtczuk, a conceptual problem in the memory management area of Linux allows local attackers to execute code at root level. The Linux issue is caused by potential overlaps between the memory areas of the stack and shared memory segments."  **Update** - As Marcus Meissner from the SUSE security team explained to heise Security, SUSE maintainer Andrea Arcangeli provided [for the problem](//linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Kernel/2004-09/7904.htmlafix) in September 2004, but for unknown reasons this fix was not included in the Linux kernel. SUSE itself [[1]](//support.novell.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2240.htmlhasthefix) and SUSE Linux Enterprise 9, 10 and 11 as well as openSUSE 11.1 through 11.3 do not exhibit this vulnerability."
