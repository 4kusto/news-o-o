Thanks to [Jürgen](//en.opensuse.org/User:Jnweiger) we now have all presentations (documents and videos) from openSUSE day at LinuxTag [ online](//en.opensuse.org/LinuxTag_2009). This time Jürgen managed it with his unbeatable charm to get a direct line to the microphone and therefor the audio quality is superb this time. Thanks to Jürgen who made again talks of an openSUSE event accessible for a very large audience. Most of the talks were given in German but 2 in English as well - marked on the page. Have fun to listen to informative talks about AppArmor, openSUSE 11.2 and the opening of Factory, SUSE Studio, Wine and more.
