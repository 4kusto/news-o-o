<td style="margin: 0pt;" > Welcome to issue # 126 of the **openSUSE Weekly News**. Now the 22nd week goes to the end, and we are pleased to announce our new issue.  This week was very interesting. The Mozilla Project announced the 64bit Firefox, but sadly just for Windows at the moment. But i think that the Project announces the Linux Version soon.  Then our calendar gives us the Information, that we have the 11.3 RC1 checkin in the next week. Soon we enjoy the new Version 11.3. But as written in the last weeks, we need testers. If you like, you can help us with that.  From the wiki side, we need more volunteers, who are willing to help in the review process from the wiki sides. So if you can speak, write and understand English, please help us in the wiki.  So we're hoping, that you like the new Weekly News. We wish you many joy by reading it...

"What really happened is that I renamed original MySQL package. Now it is called mysql-community-server. If you take a look at SUN/Oracle web, they call it like this for a long time, so it makes a little sense... As a result, there is no real package called mysql in openSUSE anymore. But mysql-community-server provides mysql so even if you try to install mysql, it will work. This change also have one funny consequence. Do you remember package mysql-client? Now it's called mysql-community-server-client face-smile-big.png (...)"

####  [Boosters: Umbrella Sprint Summary](http://news.opensuse.org/2010/05/31/boosters-umbrella-sprint-summary/)


"For the last few months some of the Boosters were working on “Umbrella” infrastructure concept for openSUSE. Various web tools grew over time and unfortunately they became almost independant and disconnected from each other. We decided to improve the situation by making openSUSE websites more integrated and easier accesible in order to help people to find the stuff they are looking for.  During the openSUSE Conference 2009 Klaas gave a talk about the current state of tools and our improvement plans. Robert created a brand new Bento theme which allowed Pavol to create a simple global menu to put on top of each website. These menus group all links to other websites into four categories: Downloads, Support, Community and Development. These more-or-less correspond to groups of users openSUSE has, which makes navigation easy and fun! (...)"

####  [Raymond Wooninck: New snapshot available in KDE4:Unstable repository](http://tittiatcoke.wordpress.com/2010/05/29/new-snapshot-availabe-in-kde4unstable-repository/)


"It is only a couple of days after the release of KDE SC 4.5 Beta 1 and openSUSE brings you an update with a newer snapshot. This snapshot resolves the issues reported with the systray, as that it contains the latest version of libdbusmenu-qt. So if you are facing issues with right clicking on the icons in the systray or some other erreoneuous behavior, then this update might solve those issues for you.  Also with this new version a new KDE bindings is released, namely perl-kde4. Unfortunately due to the required perl version, this package is only build for openSUSE Factory repository. This to prevent that 11.1 and 11.2 users have to upgrade their perl5 version which might cause incompatibility issues with other applications.(...)"

####  [Vincent Untz: Hiring a sysadmin for the GNOME infrastructure](http://www.vuntz.net/journal/post/2010/06/02/Become-a)


"Two months ago, the GNOME Foundation started a fundraising campaign to get money to hire a part-time system administrator. Actually, we started this effort much earlier, but we made it much more visible with this campaign. Thanks to all the donors and to Canonical, Collabora, Google and Nokia, we were able to reach our objective. It was actually too fast for me and I wasn't even able to blog about the campaign in time! Once we realized the money was there, we moved on to the next steps — actually, we had those steps ready in the past, so it was mainly a matter of making sure everything was still okay.  We asked around and confirmed three names to form a hiring committee: Bradley Kuhn, Jonathan Blandford and Brad Taylor. With their help, Paul updated the job description that Owen had written some time ago. And after some discussion to define the whole hiring process, Stormy announced the job today. I really love that there have been so many people involved in this, with everyone targetting the same goal. (...)"

"As of this evening the latest phonon-backend, which is based on the VLC Multimedia libraries, is available in the openSUSE KDE Playground repository. This repository also contains a stripped down version of the VLC 1.1.0 Release Candidate which is required to use the phonon-backend-vlc. The phonon-backend-vlc is the rising star among the phonon-backends and has already a lot of supporters and the multimedia application Amarok is working fine with it.  However keep in mind that there is no official release yet of this vlc phonon backend and it is currently based on the latest available svn version."

Under certain other OSs, the 'safely remove' option on usb devices will... 1/ On usb pen drive with a power/activity led, switch it off (trivial nicety, but reassuring). 2/ On usb HDDs, spin down the disk and power off.

####  Larry Finger: Weekly Review


"The TCT held an IRC meeting on May 31.  The first topic concerned the Team's experiences with Milestone 7. Response time to bug reports seems to be better than earlier. Bernhard M. Wiedemann described his methodology for automated testing of installation, and future plans to improve the tests. The Team also asked me questions regarding the testing of wireless. Unfortunately, this does not fit into an automated framework; however, I have been able to test all encryption modes with NetworkManager and the KDE desktop. Testing of Gnome will come later.  Next the Team was polled to see who among us would be at at Linuxtag in Berlin, and when they could meet to discuss testing of openSUSE 11.3.  We also discussed the openSUSE Conference in Nuremburg in October, and how best for the team to participate. We recommended that Bernhard submit a paper on his testing methodology. In addition, a "birds-of-a-feather" session for the Testing Team will likely be proposed."

Bloggers, poets, journalists, business and technical writers, fiction and nonfiction writers – we want to see you! Any other writers, and would-be writers I left out – yes, you too!  You can read about what I’m doing at WriteCamp at my other site. In brief, I’ll be leading a discussion about the future of American journalism, and doing something related to WordPress. I’ll have copies of WordPress in Depth on hand, and a pen to sign them with. I’ll also be at the pre-party Friday night, having some fun."

####  [José Oramas M.: FLISOL 2010 GYE – Some Late Numbers and Experiences](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/06/03/flisol-2010-gye-some-late-numbers-and-experiences/)


"I know, I know… it is a bit late ( more than a month ) since FLISOL took place in Guayaquil-Ecuador this year… but a lot a time consuming activities have stopped me from reporting some results. Even though more than a month have passed, I think I should let you know what happened.  Compared to previous years, the event of this year was relatively smaller. An approximate of 200 people assisted, from which for the ~80% it was their first time that assisted to FLISOL, 50% of visitors had not used or heard about FLOSS before, ~13% were below 18 years old and ~75% were between 18-35 years old."

"When I worked Pre-Sales here at Alfresco I had, on occasion, the chance to talk about integrating Alfresco with a GIS (Geographic Information System). I don’t have a lot of experience with these types of systems (actually none) but I always believed that integration was possible. (It falls into one of those categories where we believe that it is possible, but we have never actually seen it done.) Or even that a simple type of integration could be done with Google Maps to provide basic information.  I started playing with the Google Maps APIs almost 6 months ago and was able to throw together a rough POC, but felt that there was still more that I could do. I’ve gotten closer to what I envisioned and a have put together a starting example, but there is still a lot of work to do, including working around issues from the underlying APIs. (ie one of my examples will not work in some versions of Firefox or IE…I’m working on these, but believe that the answer may actually be in the code of either the browser or the Maps API.) (...)"

And when you are working in large groups around the world, sometimes you need to talk about code snippets. And then you use something like pastebin.com. But there are many similar services on the web. And I already encounter on openSUSE IRC people using for example fpaste.org. So why don't we have some paste thing to show that we are the openSUSE guys and girls? My guess is that nobody cared enough to create other one then opensuse.pastebin.com. But I was part of the Umbrella team, so I want to have everything nicely integrated... So here I come with openSUSE Paste."

####  [KDE Software Compilation 4.4.4 Out](http://www.kdenews.org/2010/06/01/kde-software-compilation-444-out)


"KDE has issued another update to the 4.4 desktop, applications and development libraries. KDE SC 4.4.4 brings, in addition to its funny version number, mainly small bugfixes that further polish the user experience. Most notable are probably sorting fixes for natural sorting in Dolphin, our nice file manager.  The KDE release team also decided to do another release in the 4.4 series, 4.4.5, to come out next month, before fully concentrating on the 4.5 tree. SC 4.4.4 though is a stable update that is recommended to everyone running 4.4.3 or earlier. Packages from your favorite OS vendor will become available soon."  


####  [GCC begins move to C++](https://lwn.net/Articles/390016/)


"I am pleased to report that the GCC Steering Committee and the FSF have approved the use of C++ in GCC itself. Of course, there's no reason for us to use C++ features just because we can. The goal is a better compiler for users, not a C++ code base for its own sake.  Before we start to actually use C++, we need to determine a set of coding standards that will apply to use of C++ within GCC. At first, I believe that we should keep the set of C++ features permitted small, in part so that GCC developers not familiar with C++ are not rapidly overwhelmed by a major change in the implementation language for the compiler itself. We can always use more of C++ later if it seems appropriate to do so, then."

####  [Volker Lanz (Torch): New In KDE Partition Manager 1.1 (II): SMART Status Reports](http://blog.volker-lanz.de/2010/05/29/new-in-kde-partition-manager-1-1-ii-smart-status-reports/)


"KDE Partition Manager 1.1 gains support for reading, analyzing and reporting the SMART status of disks. SMART (sometimes also written as S.M.A.R.T.) is an acronym for “Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology”. In plain English it is a monitoring system for hard drives and its intention is to give the computer user a chance to take action before an impending hard drive failure — the action being to copy his data to another disk, of course.  Virtually all disks sold today support SMART, though implementations differ a little from manufacturer to manufacturer. Also, SMART information cannot be accessed via USB or FireWire, so this does not work for external disks."

That changed drastically with the release of the GMA500 video chipset, named "Poulsbo." Intel let its users down by rebranding a chip made by PowerVR, which is not supported with the mainline Linux kernel and X.org. The company made it worse by passing the buck, and failing to give a clear roadmap for fixing the problem. That was in the fall of last year, but some users had hope that Intel would get it right with the release of MeeGo 1.0. Not so much. (...)"

####  [techradar/Nick Veitch: 8 of the best photo managers for Linux](http://www.techradar.com/news/software/applications/8-of-the-best-photo-managers-for-linux-692441)


"Since the arrival of consumer digital cameras, hard drives have been filling up with images of every social occasion, no matter how boring.  It soon became apparent to happy snappers that where you once merely had to look in a drawer or a photo album to find a particular snap, there may now be thousands of them on your hard drive. And so the need for photo management software was born.

One of the really neat things about Meego is how it integrates messaging right into the interface. Unsurprisingly, this messaging is powered by Telepathy, the framework that makes communications into a service that you can use throughout your product. Collabora, with its team of Telepathic Ninjas, helped Intel with some of the Telepathy integration for this release. (...)"  


####  [DevX/Robin 'Roblimo' Miller: Frank Zappa's Influence on Linux](http://blog.devx.com/2010/06/frank-zappas-influence-on-linu-1.html)


""Bitchen" sounds totally [Valley Girl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnVE3UTIgEM) right? The sort of speech pattern that, like, gags you with a spoon, right? The link two sentences back is to a YouTube (sound-only) version of the original [Frank Zappa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_zappa) song that started the whole Valley Girl thing, with the Valley Girl talk in the song supplied by his daughter Moon Unit Zappa.  Grody to the max, right? Whatever.  And all this Zappa stuff has what, exactly, to do with Linux? Zappa may have been as much of an influence on Linux and FOSS development as [LSD](http://www.pcworld.com/article/193694/steve_jobs.html?loomia_ow=t0:s0:a38:g26:r30:c0.000362:b32618944:z0) was on Apple, although the Zappa influence on Linux isn't thought about as much as the Apple-counterculture connection."  


####  [ExtremeTech/Matthew Murray MeeGo v1.0 for Netbooks Review](http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,2845,2364365,00.asp)


"The tiny notebooks are usually best for those who just want to do the most basic of basics—Web browsing, e-mail, maybe IM—and not much else. In fact, were it not for the fact that Linux is a popular operating system of choice for them due to its nonexistent cost, they'd have almost no appeal to the DIYer whatsoever. (...)"
