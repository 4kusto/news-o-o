<td style="margin: 0pt;" > Welcome to issue # 125 of **openSUSE Weekly News**. Now the twentyfirtst week goes to the end, and we are pleased to announce our new issue.  This week was very busy. I've made my first step with Milestone 7, and I like it. So I propose that you try it out too. And please not forget to file founded bugs in our [bugzilla](http://bugzilla.novell.com/).Through helping with testing, we all can make our distribution better and more stable.  The other thing where I was busy was the move from our Weekly News pages to a new Place. From now on, you can find actual Weekly News under: [http://wiki.opensuse.org/Weekly_news](http://wiki.opensuse.org/Weekly_news).  So wish you many joy by reading this Issue :-)

####  [**openSUSE Build Service 2.0 Beta1 Release Brings New User Interface**](http://news.opensuse.org/2010/05/25/obs-2-0b1/)


"The openSUSE Build Service (obs) is an open package and distribution development platform that provides a transparent infrastructure that allows developers to build for various major Linux distributions and architectures.  The public server build.opensuse.org is available for all open source developers to build packages for the most popular distributions incl. Debian, Fedora, Mandriva, openSUSE, Red Hat, SUSE Linux Enterprise and Ubuntu. It is also used to build the openSUSE distribution.  This is the first beta release of version 2.0. Version 2.0 is planned to be released on June 10th. We have updated the public server [http://build.opensuse.org](http://build.opensuse.org/) with the current code stream as part of our testing. We invite others running a build service to test the code and give feedback via the opensuse-buildservice mailing list and report bugs in bugzilla."  


####  [** openSUSE 11.3 Milestone 7: Preparing for RC Phase**](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-announce/2010-05/msg00016.html)


"Milestone 7, a snapshot of the openSUSE Factory â€œwork in progressâ€ build, leading up to openSUSE 11.3 release in July, is now available for download.  M7 is the last milestone release, the next release will be RC1 on June 17th. Now it's time for testing and bugfixing!  openSUSE 11.3 Progress  Compared to M6, this milestone brings many bug fixes, an update to Linux kernel 2.6.34 and the integration of software translations and new artwork."  


####  [**openSUSE.org Scheduled Outage**](http://news.opensuse.org/2010/05/27/opensuse-org-scheduled-outage/)


"On Saturday, June 5th, most of openSUSE.org will be down due to a network upgrade in the data center. The outage is scheduled to take place between 13:00 and 17:00 GMT (9:00 AM to 2:00 PM EDT). During that time, users can expect the following:  **Full outage** * openSUSE wiki farm  * openSUSE blogs  **Intermittent outages** * www.opensuse.org  * files.opensuse.org The staging version of these sites will be similarly affected. In addition, most novell.com site will either be unavailable or have reduced functionality. This outage should not have any affect on the software or forum sites."  


####  [Klaas Freitag: Novell Hackweek Fife](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/05/28/novell-hackweek-fife/)


"I am really looking forward to the next Hackweek that we have in Novell â€“ it will be in the week from 7-11 of June 2010.  In that week, Novell allows a whole lot of people to spend the full work time (and more ;-) to work on whatever free software they want. That is really a huge thing, because weâ€™re talking about hundrets of engineers.  What everybody is working on is as said not at all prescribed, except that it should benefit the idea of free software. There is a [list maintained](https://features.opensuse.org/query/run?search_products%5B%5D=hackweek_5&type=find) of ideas which people have for [Hackweek Fife](https://features.opensuse.org/hackweek) in order to find somebody joining the team or to pick the idea up at all.  The good thing now is that of course [openFATE](https://features.opensuse.org/) is used to maintain this list and thus it is open for the openSUSE Community to also add ideas, comment or vote on whats already there. This is of course no guarantee that the idea is going to be picked up but still. So everybody who thinks she has an idea that will inspire someone on Hackweek Fife, feel free to add it to openFATE and talk about. (...)"

####  [**Lubos Lunak: On-demand package installation in openSUSE 11.3**](http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/4232)


"You most probably have already run into this at least once. You use the computer, try to do something and you get an error message saying "sorry, application foo is not installed", "the required plugin bar is not installed" or similar. And that's it, there it stops. You have to find out what package the required functionality is in, install it manually and try again. Like if the computer couldn't ask "but maybe I can install that, do you want me to try?" and handle it itself.  And that's what my goodie for this openSUSE release is about. I've been examining a bit about what various parts of the desktop could do this and there indeed are some cases. For example, clicking in Dolphin on a file that has no associated application installed usually results in the "Open with?" dialog. And that dialog has nowhere in it the option "the application that can open it, silly". Especially given that if the installation medium is accessible (i.e. usually if the network connection is up), it's rather easy to find out the right application for the file and install it:"

You can find it for instance in [this repository](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/windows:/mingw:/win32:/EXPERIMENTAL/openSUSE_Factory/noarch/) of our wonderful openSUSE Build Service. The installer is hiding in /usr/i686-pc-mingw32/sys-root/mingw directory of the mingw32-evolution-installer RPM. For people that don't know what to do with RPM packages on windows, 7-zip does just a wonderful job at unpacking RPMs even if they use LZMA payload."

####  Larry Finger: Weekly Review


"The Testing Core Team will have an IRC meeting on May 31 at 17:00 UTC.  See [http://en.opensuse.org/OpenSUSE_Testing_Core_Team/Meetings](http://en.opensuse.org/OpenSUSE_Testing_Core_Team/Meetings) for details. Anyone that wishes may join us.  Personally, I installed M7 on my main machine using the x86_64 NET install CD and I am using it for routine work. That installation was affected by several bugs including the faulty gtk library ([https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=608087](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=608087)) that caused Firefox and Thunderbird to crash on starting. Fortunately, the "Most Annoying Bugs" page has a simple fix. My machine has an nVidia graphics adapter that got a garbled screen when using nouveau, but that was avoided with the workaround on the annoying bugs page. One other bug concerned setting up NFS clients. Within a day of creating the Bugzilla entry, a fix was ready and RC1 will be OK. The workaround was to do it manually, rather than with the GUI.  I used the i586 NET install CD to upgrade an M6 system running in a VirtualBox virtual machine. The upgrade was accomplished without difficulty and has been quite useful as I have been debugging the vendor driver for a D-Link DWA-130. The 32-bit version runs correctly, but the 64-bit one does not. The ability to try both architectures has been useful."

"This session will focus on the â€œArchitecture of Collaborationâ€ implemented in the Kablink Open Collaboration project. See how the Kablink platform allows you to build applications that solve problems while encouraging collaboration among your team members. During this session an application will be developed that takes advantage of the social networking features of Kablink while solving a common teamworking problem."

"Only a few days and then LinuxTag in Berlin starts. The openSUSE project will be there and presenting. The Boosters prepared a program with little Hacksessions. Actually I like this idea doing more as an static presentation. The Hacksessions and all talks they openSUSE people have can be found on this wikipage.  I am going with RadioTux, like all years. For me LinuxTag begun before months with preparing the interviews we do in our broadcasts on LinuxTag. So for all folks they are interested and cant go to LinuxTag in Berlin its possible to be there, just listen our streams from the fairground. So if you are interested there are some interviews with openSUSE folks and some other interviews in english too. (...)"  


####  [Bryen Yunashko: From Chicago to Paris to Nuremberg!](http://feedproxy.google.com/%7Er/Bryen/%7E3/a_O6pqpAB-s/)


"â€™m just wrapping up my mini-vacation in Paris. And getting ready for the main eventâ€¦ Nuremberg! Iâ€™ll be taking an overnight train from Paris to Nuremberg and hit the ground running as soon as I get there in the morning with the first ever openSUSE Board Retreat meeting.  Iâ€™m looking forward to this meeting. While we, the Board, have met previously just before the first openSUSE Conference in September, 2009, we only met to go over our slide presentation for the Conference. This time weâ€™re going to actually sit down face to face and talk BUSINESS!  This will be followed by the Strategy Team meeting which will run throughout the weekend, and is arguably one of the most important community moments in our openSUSE history. It is from this discussion, which takes place face to face after many months of discussion online, that we hope to set openSUSE in a new direction that gives all of us in the community clarity and focus as we continue to move forward as a distribution and project."

####  [Packman: veejay 1.5.3-0.pm.1.4 (openSUSE 11.2/i586)](http://packman.links2linux.org/package/veejay)


"Veejay is a visual instrument and real-time video sampler.  It allows you to play the video like you would play a piano. While playing, you can record the resulting video directly to disk (video sampling)."  


####  [Packman: xmms2 0.7-999.pm.68.2 (openSUSE 11.2/x86_64)](http://packman.links2linux.org/package/xmms2)


"XMMS2 is an audio framework, but it is not a general multimedia player - it will not play videos. It has a modular framework and plugin architecture for audio processing, visualisation and output, but this framework has not been designed to support video. Also the client-server design of XMMS2 (and the daemon being independent of any graphics output) practically prevents direct video output being implemented. It has support for a wide range of audio formats, which is expandable via plugins. It includes a basic CLI interface to the XMMS2 framework, but most users will want to install a graphical XMMS2 client (such as gxmms2 or esperanza)."

They are available in the Build Service [OpenOffice:org:UNSTABLE](http://en.opensuse.org/Additional_YaST_Package_Repositories#OpenOffice.org_UNSTABLE) project, are based on the [upstream](http://development.openoffice.org/releases/3.2.1rc2.html) 3.2.1-rc2 sources and include many [Go-oo](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/ooo-build/ooo-build/plain/NEWS?id=OOO_BUILD_3_2_1_2) fixes and improvements. Please, look for more details about the openSUSE OOo build on the [wiki page](http://en.opensuse.org/OpenOffice.org).  The packages are release candidates and have not passed full QA cycle yet. They might include even serious bugs. Therefore they are not intended for data-critical usage. A good practice is to archive any important data before an use, â€¦  As usual, we kindly ask any interested beta testers to try the package and [report bugs](http://en.opensuse.org/OpenOffice.org#Reporting_Bugs).

###  For Desktop Users





####  [IBM developerWorks/Martin Streicher: Speaking UNIX: The best-kept secrets of UNIX power users](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-spunixpower.html)


"(...) Most UNIX users amass settings in shell startup files, such as .bashrc (for the Bash shell) and .zshrc (for the Z shell), to recreate a preferred shell environment time and again. Startup files can create aliases, set shell options, create functions, and set environment variables. Essential environment variables include HOME (which points to your home directory), PATH (which enumerates directories in which to search for applications), and MANPATH (which lists directories in which to search for man pages). To see which environment variables are set in your shell, type printenv. Consult your shell's man page for a complete list of available environment variables."  


####  [linuxplanet.com/Akkana Peck: Making Movies in Linux with Kdenlive, part 2](http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/tutorials/7079/1/)


"You've read the last article, chosen some video clips and made a basic movie with kdenlive. Pretty easy! But you can make a better movie by adding some effects -- like transitions between scenes, music and titles.  When you cut from one clip to the next, sometimes it's jarring for the viewer -- it's hard to tell whether you've changed to a new scene. It can help to have some kind of transition effect in between.  The most common transitions are fades to or from black; and a common variant of a fade is a dissolve, where the first clip fades out at the same time the next one fades in on top of it.  To create a dissolve, start by overlapping the two clips. Do that by moving one of your two clips down to the next timeline (Figure 1)."  


###  For System Administrators





####  [GeekRide/Napster: Tech Tip: Sending Email from Command line](http://www.geekride.com/index.php/tech-tip-sending-email-from-command-line/)


"Everyone is not as lucky as having a full fletched email client like thunderbird or kmail to send mails. There is one unlucky group known as system administrators who have to send the mails either through the command line or a script running on the remote server. Also, apart from sending the emails, sometimes one needs to test or debug the email server which canâ€™t be done by traditional email clients. If you are one of those system administrators and are scared, then you shouldnâ€™t be, because this is where netcat comes to rescue."  


####  [Novell Cool Solutions/tpetersonalpine: Teaming Cluster on a Laptop using XEN, OCFS2 and Linux Virtual Services](http://www.novell.com/communities/node/11462/teaming-cluster-laptop-using-xen-ocfs2-and-linux-virtual-services)


"The purpose of this lab guide is to show, on a small scale, how a Teaming Clustered system is put together. The Lab will use a XEN Host, 2 Teaming (Tomcat) Servers, 2 Index Servers (Lucene), 1 MySQL Server. This lab assumes you know your way around SLES and XEN but provides significant guidance with OCFS2 and Linux Virtual Services."

"At Novell BrainShare Amsterdam last week, the Geekos were handing out SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1 (RC4) at IT Central. So off came my DVD drive and I installed it on a separate partition on my Thinkpad.  Since its a Release Candidate (RC4) and not the final GA version due on 2nd June, I wanted to have a quick look at how KVM works since its an officially supported hypervisor in SP1 (other than the very established Xen shipped and supported since SLES 10 back in 2006)."

"Network effects being what they are, OpenOffice.org tends to suck all the oxygen out of the room when talking about open source productivity applications. But OpenOffice.org isn't the only game in town for open source word processing. One of the best, if underexposed, open word processors is AbiWord.  AbiWord has been around for ages, but without the weight of a company like Sun behind it, the little word processor has gotten less attention than it deserves. Let's try to remedy that a bit.

####  [Richard A. Johnson: Impressions of the latest MeeGo release](http://blog.nixternal.com/2010.05.27/impressions-of-the-latest-meego-release/)


"So, I have been spending some time playing around with various netbook operating systems lately, trying to find that perfect one. A little bit of a background first. Last month I finally switched from a Blackberry phone to an Android phone, so for the past month I have spent quite a bit of time playing with the Android SDK, writing applications, checking out all of the available applications, in other words playing with my phone. After having done this now for the past month, one thing was clear, my phone integrates with my life damn near perfectly, whereas my netbook isnâ€™t even close. So with that, I set out to play with every distribution or operating system out there. The following have been the releases I have tried out: (...)"  


####  [Datamation/Sean Michael Kerner: Novell Revenues, Linux Business Slide](http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/3884966/Novell-Revenues-Linux-Business-Slide.htm)


"It's been a tough quarter quarter for Novell (NASDAQ: NOVL) as questions about its future ownership remain on the table. Novell is also facing pricing pressure on its Linux business as renewals come up on Microsoft's SUSE Linux Enterprise subscriptions.  Novell this week reported its second-quarter fiscal 2010 earnings, showing a decline in revenue, whihc came in at $204 million for the quarter, a drop from the $216 million it brought in a year earlier. On the positive side, net income hit $20 million or $0.06 per share, which is an improvement over the $16 million or $0.05 per share Novell reported for the second quarter of 2009.  But the slide in revenue continues for Novell, which provided third-quarter revenue guidance for revenues between $205 million and $210 million."  


####  [Miguel de Icaza: Linux for Consumers: MeeGo Updates](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/May-27.html)=


"Excited to see the work happening on the Linux consumer space in the MeeGo Universe. There is now a MeeGo 1.0 download available for everyone to try out.  At Novell we have been contributing code, design and artwork for this new consumer-focused Linux system and today both Michael Meeks and Aaron Bockover blog about the work that they have been doing on MeeGo.  These screenshots are taken directly from Aaron's and Michael's blog posts. Aaron discusses the new UI for the music player Banshee and Michael discusses the new UI for the Email/Calendar program."  


####  [Michael Meeks: Evolution Express (for MeeGo)](http://www.gnome.org/%7Emichael/blog/evolution-express-for-meego.html)


"Some ramblings about the creation of a new user interface for mail, calendaring etc. specifically for MeeGo; something I've been working on, amongst other things, for the last three months.  Why Express Mode ?  Initially for Moblin 2.1 we tried a more invasive re-working of the user-experience: called Anjal. That was not uniformly positive, missing many features (by design), and didn't have enough time to mature. As such, it was decided by the MeeGo team that we should try a new approach. This would take Evolution, and adapt its UI for the netbook screen-size, tweaking all the relevant defaults. We would merge the best features from Anjal, and then build from there. The result is some great MeeGo, netbook goodness, despite being done at high speed over three months.  It is important to realise that ~all netbooks have a 1024x600 screen - giving very, very few pixels - particularly vertically (most apps are tuned for at a minimum 1024x768) and as such lots of tweakage was needed to save vertical space. As Linus' Coding Style document suggests - vertical space is a non-renewable resource, and we need to conserve it: just adding scroll-bars is an ugly cheat. This quest for vspace is nastily exacerbated by the terrible touch-pads that so many net-books have, meaning we need lots of extra padding around widgets to avoid them being clicked by accident."  


####  [Aaron Bockover: Banshee for MeeGo](http://abock.org/2010/05/26/banshee-for-meego)


"After lots of intense work and collaboration, the Netbook profile for MeeGo 1.0 has been released today. As such, I am particularly pleased to announce in conjunction that Banshee is the default and integrated media player for MeeGo.  Currently, MeeGo 1.0 features the latest stable Banshee release: 1.6.1. As new Banshee versions are released, we'll be providing updated packages for MeeGo.  **The Media Panel** In MeeGo, most tasks are performed through panels that slide out from the top toolbar. This is how you can chat with friends, get lost in Twitter and other social network feeds, quickly browse and play your media, access the web, and launch and switch between applications and zones."  


###  Reviews and Essays





####  [Ghacks/Jack Wallen: Why not try OpenSuSE 11.2](http://www.ghacks.net/2010/05/26/why-not-try-opensuse-11-2/)


"I spend much of my time here on Ghacks using and talking about Ubuntu. So much so one would think itâ€™s the only game in town. Well, itâ€™s not and I am going to spend a bit of time focusing on different distributions. The first distribution I am going to focus on is OpenSuSE. OpenSuSE is similar to what Fedora is to Red Hat Linux. In other words itâ€™s a sort of sand box for developers and users to make sure the enterprise level product (SuSE Linux) is right. And, like Fedora, OpenSuSE is a free edition. It costs nothing to download and use this distribution."  


####  [Tuxradar: How Linux works: the ultimate guide](http://www.tuxradar.com/content/how-linux-works-ultimate-guide)


"Ever wanted to learn how the internals of your Linux desktop work? Yes, we've already published detailed "how it works" articles about things like sound, the kernel, LVM, PAM and filesystems, but in this article we're going to take a wider view and explain how everything in a modern Linux distro works, start to finish.  We've opted for a top-down view, tackling each stratum of Linux technology from the desktop to the kernel as it appears to the average user. This way, you can descend from your desktop comfort zone into the underworld of Linux archaeology, where we'll find plenty of relics from the bygone era of multi-user systems, dumb terminals, remote connections and geeks gone by. We're also going to be showing you some commands you can use to poke around on your own system, because where's the point of learning stuff you can't use?"  


####  [LinuxMagazine/Joe Brockmeier: WebM Poised to Bring Open Video to the Masses](http://www.linux-mag.com/cache/7786/1.html)


"Google I/O brought a lot of interesting developments, but one of the most interesting for Linux users might be the announcement of WebM. Finally, Linux will be a first-class platform for media.  WebM isnâ€™t the first effort to bring open video to the Web, but it has a number of things going for it that other solutions do not. Namely, it has the weight and backing of one of the largest companies on the Web (thatâ€™d be Google), and buy-in from most of the major browser projects and vendors."
