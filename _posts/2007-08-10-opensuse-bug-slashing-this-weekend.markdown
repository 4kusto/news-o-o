![bugs.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bugs.png) So openSUSE 10.3 Beta 1 [has now been released](https://news.opensuse.org/?p=106) and it's looking great. A long-discussed topic on the [opensuse-project@opensuse.org](mailto:opensuse-project@opensuse.org) ([subscribe](mailto:opensuse-project+subscribe@opensuse.org)) mailing list was the suggestion of having a "Bug Slashing" day or weekend. Now we can finally go ahead with that idea.

The aim of the weekend is to try to help developers and packagers by trying to clear up the Bugzilla, finding out which bugs need to be addressed, seeing if particular bugs can be reproduced and how, and where necessary seeing which [open 10.2 bugs](https://bugzilla.novell.com/report.cgi?x_axis_field=bug_status&y_axis_field=product&z_axis_field=&query_format=report-table&short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&short_desc=&long_desc_type=fulltext&long_desc=&classification=openSUSE&product=openSUSE+10.2&product=openSUSE+10.3&bug_file_loc_type=allwordssubstr&bug_file_loc=&status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr&status_whiteboard=&keywords_type=anywords&keywords=&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=NEEDINFO&bug_status=REOPENED&emailassigned_to1=1&emailtype1=substring&email1=&emailassigned_to2=1&emailreporter2=1&emailqa_contact2=1&emailcc2=1&emailtype2=substring&email2=&bugidtype=include&bug_id=&votes=&chfieldfrom=&chfieldto=Now&chfieldvalue=&format=table&action=wrap&field0-0-0=noop&type0-0-0=noop&value0-0-0=) still apply to current [Factory](http://en.opensuse.org/Factory) (10.3 Beta1). It's also the place to ask about a particular bug, or ask any other queries about whether you have found a bug. These days have run very successfully within [other](http://dot.kde.org/1161718356/) [projects](http://bugday.gentoo.org/), so it is certainly time for us to give it a go too!

It should be good fun all day (though of course showing up for any amount of time is good) and it is a great way to contribute and get directly involved. Here are the details:
