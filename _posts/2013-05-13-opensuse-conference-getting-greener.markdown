## The openSUSE Conference - Greece!


The moment is drawing close for you to attend the openSUSE Conference 2013. This time we will meet at the fantastic city of Thessaloniki, Greece. Our Greek ambassadors have worked long and hard to provide all the necessary commodities for the attendees. We will be housed as a conference in the [Olympic Museum](http://www.olympicmuseum-thessaloniki.org/), and there could not have been a better place to be. It evokes much of the spirit of what our community is, a team of people striving for a common goal.

Remember that accommodations are set by yourself, although the project does provide places where you can stay for a possible reduced price. Please read further to find the recommended lodging locations in Thessaloniki. The travel support program made news last week announcing the availability of financial support, up to 80%, for those attending the conference from far away. As always, there is a criteria to be met in order to receive the funding, but it is available and our Travel Team is ready for you!

## Promotion


Please help us spread the word about the conference. The more others know what is happening around them, the more likely they are to attend. This event is also a great promotion for the team as a whole. Given our recent release, openSUSE 12.3, the media have covered our progress on the distribution widely. Adding to that media presence, our conference is also another focus of promotion for the project. If you own a blog, Facebook, Twitter or Google Plus account, or any social media, you can download these promotional conference banners, flyers, posters at [https://conference.opensuse.org/#promote](https://conference.opensuse.org/#promote)

A new video is up on YouTube available [here!](http://youtu.be/XrA0_6kXHQo)



Put the badges and news on your favorite social media and spread the word about the openSUSE Conference!

## Get moving!


While it might seem only May, _it is already May_! You'll have to make sure your paper submission is sent and your hotel and flight are booked! Even if you are unable to attend the conference, please spread the news about the conference. To raise awareness about our openSUSE team is an effort in which we all take part.

Those attending the conference should be ready to actively participate in the proceedings. Please beware that a team effort involves everyone and when you are at the conference, likely, you will be asked to participate in organizing different things that you may not have planned for. We expect your enthusiasm and willingness to participate!

Now is also the time to plan for those who may have been undecided about attending the conference. Invite friends, colleagues and anyone that shows an interest in the world of openSUSE. A conference like this is a great opportunity to make friends, and long lasting contacts for projects of your own in which openSUSE and its infrastructure can help you succeed.
