Just a final reminder: The Google Summer of Code applications are due for students tomorrow by 19:00 UTC.Â  [Get those applications in now, folks](//socghop.appspot.com/document/show/program/google/gsoc2009/faqs#student_apply)! (That's Friday, April 3.) We've posted about GSoC previously [here ](//news.opensuse.org/2009/03/23/reminder-student-application-period-for-gsoc-starts-today/)and [here](//news.opensuse.org/2009/03/19/opensuse-project-accepted-to-google-summer-of-code-2009/).

**Mentors**: If you're not signed up in the Google system yet, please do so. If you've signed up, please be sure to also subscribe to the gsoc-mentors@opensuse.org mailing list. (gsoc-mentors+subscribe@opensuse.org)

Have questions? Join #opensuse-project or #opensuse-gsoc for openSUSE-specific questions. Join #gsoc on Freenode for general questions about Summer of Code. If the question isn't addressed in the [Google FAQ](//socghop.appspot.com/document/show/program/google/gsoc2009/faqs), [drop me an email](mailto:zonker@opensuse.org).

Google is highly unlikely to extend the deadline, so get those apps in now or be prepared to wait until GSoC 2010.
