We do a number of software and hardware updates this week for our openSUSE servers. That means that some services will not be available for some time.

**Tuesday 10:00 UTC**
Maintenance of our content delivery infrastructure for about 1 hour. That means the following service will not be available:




	
  * download.opensuse.org

	
  * stage.opensuse.org





**Wednesday 12:00 UTC**
Maintenance of our Build Service infrastructure for about 1 hour. That means the following service will not be available:



	
  * software.opensuse.org

	
  * build.opensuse.org

 	
  * api.opensuse.org

 	
  * users.opensuse.org





**Thursday **
We will update the Factory development projects according to the new discussed list. So Build Service packages should expect a high load on the system, it will most likely not really usable at this day.

Sorry for the inconvenience, but lets hope that a larger and stronger infrastructure will offer the services to you afterwards :)
