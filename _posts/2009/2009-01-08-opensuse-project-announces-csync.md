Andreas Schneider has [unleashed the first public release candidate of csync 0.42](//www.csync.org/2009/01/07/csync-0420-rc2/), which is now available as source from the [csync Web site](//www.csync.org/), or via one-click for openSUSE [11.0](//software.opensuse.org/ymp/network:synchronization:files/openSUSE_11.0/csync.ymp) and [11.1](//software.opensuse.org/ymp/network:synchronization:files/openSUSE_11.1/csync.ymp).

As mobile computing becomes more and more important, file synchronization is more important than ever. Our jobs often require working not only on multiple computers, but in multiple locations, and disconnected from our networks. To help solve this problem, we need effective strategies for replication of user data and files.

csync is a bidirectional file synchronizer for Linux and allows to keep two copies of files and directories in sync. It uses uses widely adopted protocols like smb or sftp so that there is no need for a server component of csync. It is a user-level program which means there is no need to be a superuser. With pam_csync it is possible to create roaming home directories.

For more on using csync, [see the user guide](//www.csync.org/userguide/). Please report bugs using the [bugtracker](https://dev.csync.org/). For more information on csync, or to get involved with development, see the csync Web site and join the [devel lists](//www.csync.org/communication/) or find [help in IRC.](irc://irc.freenode.net/csync)
