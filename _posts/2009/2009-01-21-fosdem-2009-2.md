![fosdem](//fosdem.org/promo/fosdem/square) One of our favorite shows for sure, and again we will be there with a lot of people. I'm also happy that Novell sponsors the event, because we think it's quite important and we like the guys :-)

If you are not aware what FOSDEM is, head over to the [website](//fosdem.org) for more information, short: it's an community event in Brussels, Belgium, on the weekend of 2009-02-07/08.

Thanks to the FOSDEM team, we have again a developer room and a booth. The room is this time H.2214 (iirc it's the same room we had last year on the second day). 

We will have 2 days of talks, some openSUSE related but some topics are for sure also interesting for users/developers of other distributions. Meet the openSUSE developers, community and friends. 

For latest information what we will do, head over to our [fosdem wiki](//en.opensuse.org/FOSDEM) page where you can also find our devroom schedule. If you want to come, and you really should, enter your name in the wiki and i will print you a openSUSE badge (SUSE/Novell employees will get it automatically). For everybody else: we will record all talks again.

See you at FOSDEM!
