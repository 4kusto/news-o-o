The [iFolder project](//www.kablink.org/ifolder) will be having its monthly meeting tomorrow, June 9th, at 14:00 UTC. The meeting will be held in the [#ifolder channel](irc://irc.freenode.net/ifolder) on Freenode.

iFolder is a simple, secure storage solution that helps enhance collaboration and improve productivity. The iFolder client is cross-platform and runs on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. The iFolder server that is used to sync and store files runs on Linux. A release for openSUSE 11.1 is due this month, and will be part of the discussion for the iFolder meeting tomorrow.

The agenda for tomorrow's meeting, so far:



	
  * Project engineering status

	
  * Website update

	
  * openSUSE Build Service update

	
  * Documentation (help needed)

	
  * Close bugs (help needed)
