Quick reminder: The student application period [starts today](//socghop.appspot.com/program/home/google/gsoc2009) for the Google Summer of Code 2009.

(See the [previous post on GSoC and openSUSE](//news.opensuse.org/2009/03/19/opensuse-project-accepted-to-google-summer-of-code-2009/).)

If you'd like to work with openSUSE, be sure to sign up as soon as possible. The deadline is April 3rd.

Quick details:



	
  * You must be **18 or older by April 20, 2009** to participate.

	
  * You must be a student, which Google defines as:
an individual enrolled in or accepted into an accredited institution including (but not necessarily limited to) colleges, universities, masters programs, PhD programs and undergraduate programs. Basically, you need to be enrolled in an accredited educational institution of some kind.

	
  * You **do _not_ need to be a computer science student**.

	
  * You can be enrolled part-time.

	
  * You can take part if you're enrolled to start college as of April 20, 2009 - even if your term hasn't started yet. (So, if you're enrolled for the fall, you would be eligible.)

	
  * You **can participate again** if you participated in SoC previously.

	
  * Time: You should plan on spending a lot of time on your project. As Google says, "**you should expect your project to be your primary focus this summer.** If you have a great internship starting soon or you're planning a month long backpacking trip, you likely won't be a good candidate for the program."


The [rest is on the Google FAQ](//socghop.appspot.com/document/show/program/google/gsoc2009/faqs#eligibility): please do read it through!

The [deadline for student applications](//socghop.appspot.com/document/show/program/google/gsoc2009/faqs#timeline) is April 3rd. There's also a [visual timeline](//is.gd/oyaO) created by Christian Moore.

Read all the FAQ and Google documentation, but still have questions? Ask on the opensuse-project list or [drop me a note](mailto:zonker@opensuse.org).
