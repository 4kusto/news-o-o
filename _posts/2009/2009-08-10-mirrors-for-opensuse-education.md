I'm proud to announce that the download area of [//www.opensuse-education.org/](//www.opensuse-education.org/) is sponsored now by 6 (!) mirrors. A big "thank you" to each of them:






  * [InterNetX GmbH](//www.internetx.de/) (special thanks for the biggest bandwith ever!)


  * [Unixheads](//us.unixheads.org/)


  * [Peter Poeml](//en.opensuse.org/User:Poeml) (special thanks for the help with mirrorbrain)


  * [openSUSE](//www.opensuse.org/) (sponsoring two mirrors)


  * [Skynet](//www.skynet.be/)


  * [Belnet](//www.belnet.be/en/)




Like openSUSE, the openSUSE-Education team use a great software named [MirrorBrain](//mirrorbrain.org/) from Peter Poeml, which makes it possible to redirect download requests transparently to the nearest mirror. As result, our endusers normally didn't even noticed that they get their files from a mirror instead of the original system.




Result: even if our [current hoster](//www.hetzner.de/) still [limits the bandwith](//lizards.opensuse.org/2009/03/01/low-bandwith-for-opensuse-education/) of our main server, our users get their software faster than ever.
