If you're in, around, or near Clemson, South Carolina this weekend don't miss the [SouthEast LinuxFest ](//www.southeastlinuxfest.org/)at Clemson University! The openSUSE Project will be exhibiting at the 'fest and giving away plenty of openSUSE DVDs, stickers, and a few other assorted goodies for openSUSE enthusiasts and contributors.

Members of the [openSUSE Education](//en.opensuse.org/Education) project will also be at the openSUSE booth to talk about open source and education, and showing off the education project's work, so be sure to stop by and learn all about what the openSUSE-Edu team is doing to promote open source and Linux as a cost-effective alternative for educational institutions.

The SouthEast LinuxFest has free and paid registrations (supporters get a SouthEast LinuxFest t-shirt to show their support for the event) and there's plenty of great talks and exhibits for openSUSE enthusiasts. See you in South Carolina!
