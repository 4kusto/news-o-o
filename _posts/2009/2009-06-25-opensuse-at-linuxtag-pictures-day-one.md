Once again, it's LinuxTag time, and (of course) openSUSE is there. Today was day one of LinuxTag, and the openSUSE crew turned out to talk openSUSE, Build Service, and SUSE Studio.

The first day of LinuxTag was off to a bit of a slow start, with traffic a bit lighter than it was last year -- but we still had quite a few people stopping by the booth and asking about openSUSE, playing with the netbooks and other demo systems, learning about SUSE Studio and the openSUSE Build Service, and generally having a good time.

If you're in Berlin or nearby, be sure to visit LinuxTag this week! LinuxTag runs through Saturday, June 27th. Don't forget, Saturday is [openSUSE Day at LinuxTag](//en.opensuse.org/LinuxTag)! We have great talks in store for everybody at LinuxTag, including presentations on LTSP in openSUSE, Wine on openSUSE, AppArmor, and what's new in openSUSE 11.2.

Here's a sneak peek of the openSUSE booth for those of you who haven't made it to LinuxTag just yet:
