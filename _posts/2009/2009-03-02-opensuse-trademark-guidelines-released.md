The openSUSE Project is pleased to announce the release of the [openSUSE Trademark Guidelines](//en.opensuse.org/Image:OpenSUSE_Trademark_Guidelines.pdf) (PDF). With the guidelines, the openSUSE Project is looking to clarify the use of the openSUSE marks and make it easier to redistribute openSUSE-based projects.

Since it's easier than ever to create customized versions of openSUSE, we've seen a lot of interest in the branding of derivative distros. When is it OK to call a distro "openSUSE," or "powered by openSUSE," and when does the branding need to be removed entirely? The guidelines are an attempt to answer as many of those questions as possible in one concise document.

**What Do the Guidelines Cover?**

The openSUSE Trademark Guidelines cover using the openSUSE marks for derivative distributions, merchandise, domain names, advocacy groups, events, publications, advertising materials, and much more.

If you're doing anything that involves redistributing openSUSE or materials with the openSUSE marks, you should look over the trademark guidelines to ensure that your use is permitted.

**Seeking Special Permission**

If you want to use the official openSUSE marks, but fall outside the permitted uses_ _it is still possible to get permission. If you'd like to seek special permisison, send an email to [permission@novell.com](mailto:permission@novell.com) with your contact information and an explanation of the situation.

**Have Questions?**

For discussion of the guidelines and policies around the openSUSE marks, feel free to ask on the openSUSE-project mailing list. (opensuse-project@opensuse.org, subscribe using opensuse-[project+subscribe@opensuse.org](mailto:project+subscribe@opensuse.org).)

Discussion about openSUSE branding in general can be directed to the openSUSE marketing mailing list (opensuse-marketing@opensuse.org, subscribe using [opensuse-marketing+subscribe@opensuse.org](mailto:opensuse-marketing+subscribe@opensuse.org).)
