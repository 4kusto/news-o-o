[openSUSE Conference 2011 to be creative and open!](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/05/16/opensuse-conference-2011-to-be-creative-and-open/)

**Time to get ready for the openSUSE Conference 2011**

On Sunday the 11th of September it will be that time again: [the openSUSE Conference](http://conference.opensuse.org) starts. And of course
      we want an exciting program. Today, the proposal submission time starts and you have until
      July 11th to let us know what you want to discuss at the conference!

**The openSUSE Conference**

The openSUSE conference is where Free Software people meet. And a meeting of so many
      developers, artists, translators, documentation writers and others leads to great things! The
      latest Free Software technologies will be showcased, cool projects initiated and great ideas
      discussed. Last year, [the conference
        was awesome](https://news.opensuse.org/2010/10/28/opensuse-conference-big-success/) and resulted in many new projects and collaborative efforts. This year,
      the conference will be combined with the SUSE Labs conference to bring even more brilliant
      minds together! The SUSE Labs conference has traditionally been about advancing low-level
      technology like the kernel and surrounding infrastructure as well as server related,
      deployment and management tools. 

The openSUSE Conference 2011 will happen from **Sunday 11th to
        Wednesday 14th of September** in Nuremberg, Germany. This date shouldn™t conflict
      with too many other conferences. We™ll be open for registration and a pre-party on **Saturday night**! The website on [conference.opensuse.org](http://conference.opensuse.org) is being updated still
      and we™ll let you know once you can register.

We expect about 500 visitors this year and hence had to find a new location. A perfect
      spot was found in [a previous industrial complex from AEG named ˜Zentrifuge˜](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_Location_Zentrifuge). This cultural center might not be the ˜usual™ space for an
      IT conference but offers a very creative and open space, currently used for art and music.
      Exactly right for the openSUSE Free Software gathering! (...)

[Manu Gupta:
        My GSoC Project “ SaX3](http://sysbytes.wordpress.com/2011/05/20/my-gsoc-project-sax3/)

Well, SaX off course needs no introduction for old time openSUSE and SUSE Users and
      certainly lots of people want it to be back on openSUSE. My proposal for Google Summer Of Code
      for SaX3 was selected and my mentor will be Michal HrušeckÃ½. Now I will tell about the little
      interesting things on which I will be working on and some of the more interesting things later
      on at the end of the blog post. 

SaX as most of on planet SUSE knows stands for SUSE Advanced X Configuration Tool, but for
      others lets say we want to have a Graphical Front End for Xorg.conf.d, so that we can easily
      configure our hardware too. The specific bits on which I will be focusing would be keyboard,
      mouse, touchpad and offcourse whats SaX without a good screen configuration tool like monitor,
      yes we will support that. One of the interesting features that SaX3 will support that it will
      have a graphical UI for ncurses mode even, so even if your X is not functioning, you dont need
      to remember a lot of command line commands.

          [Nelson Marques: Advancing with GNOME:Ayatana repository](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/05/17/advancing-with-gnomeayatana-repository/)
        

Last week I™ve received an email from Bruce Byfield asking a few questions about this
          project. I™ve replied honestly as I would to anyone, I™ve faced several issues, and it
          sounded wise to me to hold a bit this. Since the Beta release of Natty that I™m following
          a technology forum in Portugal (over 150.000 users) and making a few notes on what peoples
          perceptions are about Unity and Natty. 

From what I see amongst this segment of the Linux users in my country, it™s
          interesting¦ While legacy users are moving away from Ubuntu to other alternatives seeking
          GNOME3 (no one seems to be moving from GNOME/Unity to KDE), others are satisfied with
          Unity. The biggest problem with Natty users so far comes regarding Networking issues and
          hardware compatibility¦ and once more Ubuntu™s kernels seem to be driving some people to
          desperation with the classical MCE™s. 

A few days (4 days ago), Compiz 0.9.5 has been released. I™ve taken a look on the
          Ubuntu package and the patch level has dropped substantially, which points that upstream
          has absorbed most of them. Dominique already has 0.9.5 prepared on X11:Compiz (though the
          version needs a bump on the spec) and I™m going to test them out and start branching them
          over to GNOME:Ayatana during the next days and depending on the availability of reviews.
          This should be peaceful. 

For this repository I™m going to enable a small pattern to provide a simple 1-Click
          Installer for Compiz alone, this means that people will be able to test the patched
          version of Compiz in which Unity will be build upon in the future. 

After Compiz is established on GNOME:Ayatana, I™m going to get back to Unity and
          prepare Unity2D for deployment (being Unity a task for the future). Now if some people
          wonder why all of this innactivity? The answer is simple¦ GNOME3 was being prepared and
          launched, and it deserved all the spotlights! 

Now that GNOME3 has proudly established itself on it™s segment and despite the press
          attacks, the communities I keep tracking, I see what seems to be a substantial increase of
          interest on GNOME3. I would personally consider GNOME3 launch a success. (...)

          [Nelson Marques: Unity 2D to enter GNOME:Ayatana soon¦](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/05/19/unity-2d-to-enter-gnomeayatana-soon/)
        

In the past days I™ve been packaging and fixing some issues on Unity 2D for inclusion
          on the GNOME:Ayatana repository in the openSUSE Build Service.

This gave me an excellent opportunity to test a few components share by both, Unity
          and Unity 2D, which is the case of ˜unity-place-applications™ and ˜unity-place-files™,
          both using Zeitgeist which is already in Factory for the upcoming openSUSE 12.1. We thank
          the integration of this packages to Federico Quintero. Thanks Fred.

A few more additional packages need some care and once they get updated and tested
          they will be uploaded to GNOME:Ayatana, at which time I will provide an installer
          (1-Click) for those willing to test Unity-2D. Unity 2D will be the first application to
          use the indicators I have prepared in the past which all all found working, except 1, the
          AppMenu (strangely it works on GNOME2 panel without issues).

This is how Unity 2D looks like. There are transparencies because I enabled
          ˜composite™ on metacity, which works very nicely. As far as I could understand, the
          developers of Unity 2D are also looking into implementing Compiz with Unity 2D, which
          would be sweet. (...)

##### Top voted Features




            [decouple download and installation (Score: 348)](https://features.opensuse.org/120340)
          

Network installation could be improved by running package download and package
            installation in parallel.






            [Look at plymouth for splash during boot (Score: 183)](https://features.opensuse.org/305493)
          

I wanted to open a fate feature about this when I first heard of plymouth, but
            reading
            http://fedoramagazine.wordpress.com/2008/10/21/interview-fedora-10s-better-startup/
            really makes me think we should go this way.

Ray's comment starting with "Every flicker and mode change in the boot
            process takes away from the whole experience." is especially interesting. Is it
            okay to track the "don't show grub by default" here?






            [Update to GRUB v2 (Score: 124)](https://features.opensuse.org/308497)
          

Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn't
            going to go away. The code itself isn't well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It's only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don't have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)
            (...)

            [Popularity contest (Score: 99)](https://features.opensuse.org/305877)
          

We need a feedback about packages that are preferred by users and actively used. Debian already has a tool named Popularity contest (popcon)

    

* reusing popcon will give us results that are directly comparable with Debian and Ubuntu
    

* packagers team can take care of the package
    

* we need a configuration dialog in YaST that is visible enough
    

* we need a server infrastructure on opensuse.org. (There are certain privacy issues, see Debian FAQ for details)

            [clear /tmp-dir at bootup](https://features.opensuse.org/312337)
          

Please clear the /tmp-dir at boot-up per default.

At the moment this has to be activated manually with every new installation, is there a reason for not doing this out of the box?






            [Add BlueGriffon web editor to the repositories](https://features.opensuse.org/312338)
          

BlueGriffon is a relatively young project, but it does seem to be very good when compared to some of the other open source tools, not to mention that it's still a very active project.






            [YaST should warn during install if swap partition is too small for suspending](https://features.opensuse.org/312339)
          

I made the mistake and installed just 2 GB swap on a laptop with 4 GB ram. I
just forgot to think about suspending the computer will need an suitable swap
partition. Now it's sometimes working an sometimes not...

It would be nice and helpful if YaST would warn the user about that problem during the install process.






            [Push Perl 5.14 to Tumbleweed repository](https://features.opensuse.org/312340)
          

Perl 5.14 is here. Please, add new version on Tumbleweed repository.






            [get rid of /etc/sysconfig/sysctl](https://features.opensuse.org/312343)
          

/etc/sysconfig/sysctl and therefore boot.proc and boot.ipconfig should be dropped in favor of directly using /etc/sysctl.conf Distro defaults should be provided via /lib/sysctl.d./*.conf so we don't produce .rpmnew files on upgrade.

    

  1. write script to convert old setings in aaa_base's %post [ready]

  2. write patch for sysctl to read /lib/sysctl.d/*.conf [ready]

  3. adjust yast modules

Affected yast modules:

  * security (IP_TCP_SYNCOOKIES, IP_FORWARD, IPV6_FORWARD, ENABLE_SYSRQ)

  * network (IP_FORWARD, IPV6_FORWARD)

  * tune (ENABLE_SYSRQ)






            [Add --conf-foo flag to zypper for all "foo" in /etc/zypp.conf](https://features.opensuse.org/312344)
          

[ [https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=693765](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=693765) ]

Flags to override settings in /etc/zypp/zypp.conf, such as --repos-dir, --cache-dir, --raw-cache-dir, have been requested and added piecemeal over time. See for example Bug #441377 and Bug #693740.
How about solving this once and for all with a generic flag pattern, so that e.g. --conf-sect-foo would be override the setting for config variable `foo' in section [sect] of /etc/zypp/zypp.conf.
So for example, packagesdir could be overridden via --conf-main-packagesdir. Etc.

This is what many other utilities do. For example, OpenSSH does with the '-o' flag (e.g., `-oPort=1234').






            [AuthorizedKeysCommand patch for openssh OR openssh-lpk](https://features.opensuse.org/312362)
          

There has long been a need to combine opensshd authorized keys with ldap. A couple of solutions have come about, and I would love to see one of these make it mainstream with opensuse.
Here is one patch I have found that is supposedly being implemented on both Fedora and RHEL6 products: [https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1663](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1663)

Of course there is the openssh-lpk patch as well.

[http://code.google.com/p/openssh-lpk](http://code.google.com/p/openssh-lpk)

My company has standardized on suse some time ago, but by policy we require dual factor authentication (key and password). We can not move to an ldap solution until there is a way to integrate ssh keys into ldap. We are a growing company and it is getting to the stage where it is painful to manage each server individually without a centralized system for authentication.






            [Qualcomm Gobi Wizard, making mobile broadband simple](https://features.opensuse.org/312364)
          

My HP un2400 Gobi device is supported and should work. Whether it is due to USB mode switching or that the gobi_loader does not work correctly I do not know. There should be a simple wizard like that which ships under Windows (VZW connection manager) to allow me and other users in the same situation to easily make us of the Mobile Broadband we pay for. This is the final thing keeping me from wiping Windows off my netbook entirely.

The Testing Core Team met on Monday, May 9 at 17:00 UTC. The main topic of discussion
          was preparing for the upcoming openSUSE 12.1 release. We decided that a Feature Test Plan
          needs to be developed. As the nature of the new features in 12.1 becomes clearer, such a
          plan will evolve. 

We also discussed whether the TCT should be involved with testing of Tumbleweed or
          Evergreen. As none of us are users of these two products, the general consensus was that
          we should concentrate on 12.1 and not get officially involved with these other activities. 

Our next meeting will be Monday, May 23 at 17:00 UTC on our usual IRC channel. This
          meeting was scheduled to occur after the release of 12.1 M1; however, that event is
          delayed. I expect a short discussion.

        [Michal HrušeckÃ½: LinuxTag 2011](http://michal.hrusecky.net/2011/05/linuxtag-2011/)
      

Last week I was at LinuxTag in Berlin. It was a great event. This time it was my second
        year there. I really enjoyed the first year and so I did this time as well. I spoke to many
        people, learned new interesting stuff and my todo list got again somehow longer 

![](http://michal.hrusecky.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif)

And I believe that I also showed some interesting stuff to the people at our
        booth. I was speaking about GNOME Shell to anybody who happened to be nearby and everybody
        liked it! Good work, GNOME guys! I™m glad I was able to be there and I want to share few
        pictures from the event with you, so even if you couldn™t make it there, you™ll see at least
        a little bit of what we were doing. We had a lot of fun

        [Marcus Meissner: Wine on Linuxtag 2011](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/05/16/wine-on-linuxtag-2011/)
      

As Christian Boltz and myself held a quite successful talk on Wine on the 2010 openSUSE
        conference, we decided to again hold a talk at Germanys largest Linux fair, Linux Tag 2011
        in Berlin.

![](http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/0516-125435a-150x150.jpg)

We again ran the pun talk Wine (not) the Emulator vs Wine the beverage, with
        Christian talking about life and work at a vineyard and his wine grower community at
        Deutsches Weintor.

![](http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/5720342876_a1ed609bc6_b-150x150.jpg)

Included in this talk was a Wine tasting of 4 different kinds of Wine, as grown in the
      area were Christian lives.

![](http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/5720344274_3f4a4e3edb_b-150x150.jpg)

His stories on Vineyard activities and the processing from grape to wine interluded with
        myself talking about Wine the Emulator, its historical and statistical parts, game support
        and futures.

![](http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/5720348760_0dab4c2a3d_b-150x150.jpg)

Around 70 people enjoyed our light hearted wrap up talk of this Linux Tag
        conference.

        [Jos Poortvliet: LinuxTag 2011](http://blog.jospoortvliet.com/2011/05/linuxtag-2011.html)
      

Last week openSUSE had 30 Geekos at LinuxTag in Berlin. Awesome times, with the
        exception of the last day when we figured out the power supplies of our nice big
        touchscreens were stolen... And to think the thieves left the beamer?!?

**Talks**

But aside that little snag, we rocked. At the booth we had mini-presentations, which
        weren't as successful as last year, but the 15 presentations we gave in the big rooms worked
        out just fine. Of course, Vincent Untz had to give his cross-distribution ollaboration talk
        as first presentation on the day after the party and my own openSUSE 11.4 intro was
        scheduled at the same time as fellow Geeko Eckhart's talk about Wayland. 

![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yLcLAhGeAvw/TdI73ikYSfI/AAAAAAAABgQ/DiuFhaYywVE/s320/Image0187.jpg)

Still, I'm quite sure we got the word out on openSUSE. Especially when it comes to
        'openSUSE is more than a distro'. Personally, I feel more and more strongly on that subject.
        Presenting openSUSE 11.4 is nice - we've got some interesting things there, but honestly -
        what is really so special about the specific kernel or LibreOffice version we ship? I feel a
        lot happier telling people about [Tumbleweed](http://opensuse.org/Tumbleweed) or [OBS](http://build.opensuse.org)! (...)

I was traveling last week to attend two events: Solutions Linux in Paris and LinuxTag in
      Berlin. It was a bit unfortunate that they happened during the same week, as they conflicted
      for two days ” which means I missed some days for both events. And on top of that, the
      Ubuntu Developer Summit was also last week, which resulted in some people missing the
      events... 

Compared to last year, both events had a quite visible difference in terms of number of
      visitors. I'm not exactly sure why this is so; it could be because there were conflicts with
      other events, or also because they moved to first half of May, which is different from
      previous years. 

What was most amazing, however, was to be present at booths just one month after the
      GNOME 3.0 release. For both events, we had tons of GNOME 3 PromoDVDs (kindly offered on
      behalf of the openSUSE project) to give away, and that was a big success: I think we gave
      around 600 of them at Solutions Linux and probably a similar amount, if not more, at
      LinuxTag (Tobias would know better than me here).

Berlin is a great location for the Linuxtag, it™s always nice to come there. Just have a
      look at the photo: The boosters are getting hip! Nearly the complete boosters team was there
      to meet, be available at our booth for questions and take part at the talks. With over 10.000
      attendees it™s the biggest event of this kind, and you can be sure to always meet some well
      known faces of the openSUSE community there.

On the technical side, there were some interesting talks about virtualization,
      cross-distribution, kernel and the usage of free software in business environments just to
      give a few examples. (...)

        [Jos Poortvliet: Promoting openSUSE at a conference](http://blog.jospoortvliet.com/2011/05/promoting-opensuse-at-conference.html)
      

openSUSE has many ambassadors who go out to conferences to talk about openSUSE like
          [last week at LinuxTag](http://blog.jospoortvliet.com/2011/05/linuxtag-2011.html). The marketing team provides them with a number of resources:

  * The openSUSE talking points

  * The openSUSE artwork repository

  * The openSUSE ambassador wiki

Each of those is frequently undergoing changes and improvements. The latest change to
        the [talking points](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Talking_points), for
        example, introduces three [elevator pitches](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Why_openSUSE) to help you quickly explain openSUSE to people. Input (preferably in the
        form of fixes to the linked wiki page!) is of course welcome. 

The [artwork repository](https://gitorious.org/opensuse-artwork/opensuse-artwork/trees/master/) offers lots of poster- and flyer artwork as well as a number
        of ready-made presentations. Unfortunately git, which is where this is all hosted, is not
        super-nice as a way to **distribute** content. The
        presentations are up to 25 mb, which you can't download from gitorious directly... Luckily,
        Bruno "Tigerfoot" Friedman has set up a nice mirror where you can download the
        presentations. 

However, for input, git merge requests are certainly preferred :D 

The[ Ambassador portal](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Ambassadors) on
        the wiki leads you to lots of good resources, like [how to organize an event](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Events). 

So, ambassadors, use what we have - and let us know if it works for you or even better -
        just improve it!

My [previous plea for help](http://www.kroah.com/log/linux/lf_colab_panel_help.html) worked out very well. The resulting video of the talk can be seen [here](http://video.linux.com/video/1972), with one of the highlights being the
        phrase, "It is cheaper to work upstream in the kernel" from Dirk Hohndel who works at Intel.
        There's a summary of the talk on [lwn.net](http://lwn.net/) over [here](http://lwn.net/Articles/437929) if you don't want to sit through the
        whole video.

Since I received so many good questions that I worked into the talk last time, I figured
        I would try it again. In a few weeks, I'll be [interviewing Linus Torvalds on stage at the LinuxCon Japan conference](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon-japan/schedule), with the topic naturally being
        "20 Years of Linux."

But there's no reason we have to stick with that topic, right? [Send me your ideas and questions](mailto:greg@kroah.com) and I'll do my
        best to pick through them and come up with something entertaining enough to fill up a 45
        minute discussion between two boring Linux kernel developers.

On May 14 2011, we joined the calling from our friends from the web page xariseto.gr.
        They had a bazaar in , Thessaloniki, New statue K.Karamanlis (40.622943, 22.951405 in google
        maps). 

Xariseto is a festival where people meet and donate their personal belongings which they
        don™t use any more. So as a Linux and openSUSE community we thought that participating in
        these kind of festivals is really interesting. 

Me and Efstathios Iosifidis set up a booth in order to inform people about FOSS and
        openSUSE project. We had all the related stuff about Gnome and openSUSE project around the
        booth (DVD™s , Cheat Sheet, flyer).

  * Open up [Yast2](http://en.opensuse.org/YaST2-GTK)**or** click on the "Online Update" applet running in your GNOME or
          KDE panels

  * Select the flash-player update and install it

  * Make sure you restart **
          all

      [h-online/Thorsten Leemhuis: What's new in Linux 2.6.39](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/What-s-new-in-Linux-2-6-39-1242910.html)
    

**The latest Linux kernel offers drivers for AMD's current high-end graphics chips and ipsets that simplify firewall implementation and maintenance. The Ext4 file system and the block layer are now said to work faster and offer improved scalability. Hundreds of new or improved drivers enhance the kernel's hardware support.**

Version 2.6.39 once again took Linus Torvalds and his fellow developers less than 70 days
      to complete. This is further indication of a slight, though ever more apparent, increase in
      the kernel's development speed, as about 80 to 90Ã½days still passed between the release of two
      versions one or two years ago. With 2.6.39, this also meant that there was a slight decrease
      in the number of advancements which are worth mentioning in the Kernel Log; however, there are
      still plenty of changes that will make Linux faster and better.

This article will provide a brief description of the new Linux version's most important
      improvements. Many of these improvements affect not only servers but also notebooks and
      desktop PCs. The distribution kernels will bring the improvements to the majority of Linux
      systems in the short or medium term, as these kernels are based on the kernels released by
      Linus Torvalds. (...)

      [DesktopLinux: Linux 2.6.39 assists firewalls, speeds up Ext4](http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS8245116373.html)
    

The Linux 2.6.39 kernel was released featuring new IPset technology for simplifying
      firewall deployment. Other major features include Ext4 performance and scalability
      improvements, a media controller subsystem for video acquisition, a block plugging overhaul
      for fast storage I/O, and support for new AMD "Cayman" Radeon graphics.

Linus Torvalds [
        announced the 2.6.39 release
      ](http://lwn.net/Articles/443684/) with some doubts as to whether he should
      have issued another RC release instead. A scheduling conflict caused by the fact that the
      Linux creator and overseer is wanted for a keynote at [
        LinuxCon Japan
      ](http://www.linuxfordevices.com/c/a/News/OReilys-Android-Open-Conference-plus-LinuxCon-Japan/) on June 1-3 forced him to
      push the new kernel out the door without merging more code. The deciding factor, he writes, is
      that this kernel release window has been "fairly 'easy'."

Linux 2.6.39 is a modest release compared to the mid-March [
        Linux 2.6.38
      ](http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS6031587360.html), which featured an overhaul of the Virtual File System and a
      performance enhancing "automatic process grouping" patch, among other improvements. That
      release may have also seen a major power regression leading to higher power consumption,
        [
        according to Phoronix benchmarks

        [Pascal Bleser: What's an orig-addon ?](http://dev-loki.blogspot.com/2011/05/whats-orig-addon.html)
      

Funny question eh? :)

Let me take a step back first. There are quite a few packages that the openSUSE project
        cannot publish on their main infrastructure, not because of legal reasons, but for reasons
        of potential software patent infringements. That, combined with the fact that the main
        sponsor of the openSUSE project (Attachmate, formerly Novell) also sponsors almost all the
        IT infrastructure, the fact that Attachmate (and Novell before them) is a business in the
        USA, and that the USA has the most ludicrous legal precedents regarding software patents
        (hey, the market regulates itself, right ?), puts us into such a situation. It isn't
        different for most other distributions by the way, except for a very few which probably only
        get away with it because they remain rather small and under the radar.

What am I talking about? Well, packages such as gstreamer-0_10-plugins-bad, MPlayer,
        vlc, xine, libmad, etc... Typically because they contain implementations of multimedia
        codecs such as for [MP3](http://dev-loki.blogspot.com/2011/05/open%20http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3) or [H.264](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC)
        which are heavily covered with software patents.

The [Packman](http://packman.links2linux.org) project and repository
        provides many of those packages (amongst other things) for openSUSE, hosted in a country
        where software patents do not apply. Now, don't confuse software patents and copyright:
        copyright is well established, precise and there are no groups of people on the planet who
        respect copyright more than open source and Free software developers, specifically because
        copyrights such as the [GPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPL), [BSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses) or [ASL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License) (to name [just a few](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/index.html)) protect our work
        and our ideals. Hence, what we are doing is not illegal in any way. As an example, the
          [mad](http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/) library might be subject to
        software patent infringement where applicable, but is under the [GPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPL).

Okay, now back to the actual topic. The libraries of the [gstreamer](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) framework are maintained by
        several contributors of the openSUSE project in the [multimedia:libs](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=multimedia%3Alibs) project in our famous [openSUSE Build Service](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Build_Service). However,
        as explained above, the [download repositories of multimedia:libs](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/multimedia:/libs) may not host the packages that might infringe on software patents
        (where applicable). So what we are doing, is to [link](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_Tips_and_Tricks#link_and_aggregate) those packages on our [Build Service instance at Packman](http://pmbs.links2linux.org) (yes, the Build Service can do that, awesome feature :)). The
        difference is that on Packman, due to some macros, we do build those parts that potentially
        infringe on software patents, and also host them in our repository and [its mirrors](http://packman.links2linux.org/MIRRORS.html). The trick is that
        they're subpackages that end in "-orig-addon". For example, for the package
        "gstreamer-0_10-plugins-bad", its companion is "gstreamer-0_10-plugins-bad-addon-orig" (yes,
        I agree, the suffix "orig-addon" is stupid, too "geeky" and not intuitive in any way.)

In the last tutorial we created a file using our text editor and saved a function to it.  This file was called trivia.py and in it was the module trivia.  We then started Python in a console and import()ed the trivia module.  Once imported, it created a namespace and we could access the askQuestion() function from within the trivia namespace by using a dot “ trivia.askQuestion().  In order for the module to work properly we had to include an import statement within the module itself so that everything that the module relied upon was imported within the module.  We then manually loaded our data from a pickle file we created and, manually, ran the askQuestion() function on the first question in our data store.   Finally we added docstrings to the function and the module.

In this tutorial we™re going to try to do much the same thing again, but without using the Python interpreter.  That is, we will need to take the things we did in the interpreter and implement them in our trivia.py file.  We will have a functioning (although still quite simple) stand alone Python program.

If your system has been rooted, you can't trust utilities like ps to show processes from the rootkit. For ferreting out nasties, you'll want to check out unhide and unhide.rb.

If you've ever encountered a rootkit, you know the symptoms -- suddenly a box is sluggish or sending out gobs of network traffic -- but running top and ps aux show nothing that should be the culprit. One quick and dirty way to turn up the offending processes is to use the unhide utility or its Ruby counterpart unhide.rb. It's a helpful tool to have around for Linux server management. (...)

      master. Ã½And instead of updating the package myself, I suggested they just BURP:

  * **Branch**,

  * **Update**,

  * **Request**,

  * the **Package**

And by doing so we all get the latest versions in the devel project and soon in Tumbleweed
      and openSUSE Factory. Ã½So ambassadors, boosters and motivated contributors know how to do that

Miguel de Icaza hasÂ [announced](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2011/May-16.html)Â the launch ofÂ [Xamarin](http://www.xamarin.com/), a
        company dedicated to creating Mono-based products. Those products will include new
        commercial .NET products for iOS and Android, similar to and source-compatible with
        MonoTouch and MonoDroid, developed from scratch and based on the open source Mono but still
        not open source. Xamarin will also be exploring possible opportunities for Moonlight in
        mobile and in the Mac app store. Icaza adds that the new company will continue to make code
        contributions, maintain and develop both open source Mono and the Moonlight
        components.

De Icaza has also finally given public confirmation that Attachmate began laying off all
        the Mono developers, starting with those in Canada and America, on 2 May, followed by the
        Europe, Brazil and Japan teams in the days following. This included all the MonoTouch and
        MonoDroid engineers and other key Mono developers. The layoffs happened amid theÂ [wider layoffs](http://www.h-online.com/news/item/Layoffs-begin-at-Novell-s-Utah-base-1236676.html)Â that were instituted by Novell's new owners. Attachmate would not

Attachmate's [SUSE](http://www.novell.com/linux/) division has
        confirmed, as The H reported [three weeks ago](http://www.h-online.com/news/item/Novell-deal-completed-Update-1233824.html), that Nils Brauckmann is the new head of the freshly created business
        unit which will be headquartered in Nuremberg. For the first time, The H talked with
        Brauckmann about his new position and how the changes in the SUSE division will affect
        openSUSE. The H pointed out to Brauckmann that there was only one mention of [openSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org/en/) in the press release on SUSE and that
        might be taken to mean that the open source version of SUSE Linux was being downgraded. 

He replied that openSUSE was very prominent in the company's thinking saying "Frankly
        the opposite will be the case" and that SUSE understood the value of the openSUSE community
        and working with the wider open source community. Inside the company "many people are very
        happy with the renewed focus and the revitalised brand" said Brauckmann, who also pointed
        out that many SUSE developers are also openSUSE contributors. He hoped to enable them to
        make more effective contributions in future by providing tools to help enhance and automate
        Q&A, build and test processes too. Support can also include funding too he noted and, as
        an example, SUSE will be funding this year's openSUSE conference. (...)

The Chrome OS project is putting a browser on top Linux to provide a fast and functional operating system. But one guy has done the reverse, emulating an x86 PC in JavaScript and using it to run Linux.

There is nothing like a few benchmarks to encourage companies to push their technologies to the next level. With web browsers, JavaScript performance is often advertised as a killer feature. But, as any web developer will tell you, more often than not web 2.0 applications are developed targetting a low common denominator: Internet Explorer (versions less than 9 anyway).

Still, that doesn't stop hobbiest from exploring the possibilities that are provided by the latest wave of high performance JavaScript engines. [JSLinux](http://bellard.org/jslinux/) is one such example. It emulates a 486 based PC and uses it to run a 2.6.20 Linux kernel based OS, and includes a host of terminal tools like vi, emacs, tiny c compiler and more. (...)

        [Linux.com/Jack Wallen: Stop Spam with Bogofilter on Linux ](http://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/446736-stop-spam-with-bogofilter-on-linux)
      

There are two things in life that are assured: taxes and spam. There is little that can
        be done about taxes. As for spam, you can find a solution. Ideally, ISPs handle this and
        spam never makes its way to an end user system. This rarely happens, though, so measures
        must be taken to prevent the deluge from coming.

There are a number of tools available for Linux to prevent spam. One of those tools,
        Bogofilter, is an incredibly well done system that seamlessly integrates into both [Evolution](http://projects.gnome.org/evolution/) and [Claws-Mail](http://www.claws-mail.org/). This tutorial will walk you through
        the process of getting Bogofilter integrated with two of the more popular Linux email
        clients as well as helping you train Bogofilter for spam and ham.

        [ITWorld/Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols: 5 Skype alternatives for Linux users](http://www.itworld.com/unified-communications/166637/5-skype-alternatives-linux-users?page=0,0)
      

While many people use Skype for its free voice over IP (VoIP) services, Linux users have
        a love/hate relationship with it. Yes, Skype will run on some versions of Linux, but it
        doesn't run on all of them, and the Linux version (2.2-beta) lags far behind the Windows
        version (Skype 5.3). That's three major generations behind. Need I say more?

Much as I dislike [Microsoft's recent purchase of Skype](http://www.itworld.com/networking/163569/microsoft-agrees-buy-skype-85-billion) and even though I think [Skype's technology](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/networking/how-skype-does-and-doesn-8217t-work/1051) is held together by bailing wire and duct tape, maybe Skype
        will become better for Linux with Microsoft. After all, it couldn't be much worse!

That said, there are numerous Linux VoIP programs and they're also free as in
        "free beer," as well as free as in "free software." Most of these
        programs use the open SIP ([Session Initiation Protocol](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3261.txt)) standard or Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol
          ([XMPP](http://xmpp.org/)) If they use the same protocol, you should be
        able to use one client to call another. To do this, of course, they must be on the same SIP
        or XMPP network. For example, I use the Ekiga.net VoIP network for SIP calls.

        [Free Software Foundation/Richard Stallman: Microsoft Skype](http://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/microsoft-skype)
      

How will this affect the success of Skype's spyware, they ask? Was it good strategy for
        one or the other? Did Microsoft pay too much? How does this affect the possible success of
        this or that other company? Questions whose perspective regards people as nothing more than
        terrain for these nonhumans to squabble over. 

All those questions alter nothing that matters for us. 

The Skype client program is nonfree software: it gives its owner power over its users.
        Presently it will give the same power to a different company. The identify of the master is
        just a detail, because freedom means not having a master. 

One part of freedom, for computer users, is not using Skype. 

The GNU Project is developing [free software to do more or less the same job](http://www.gnutelephony.org/index.php/GNU_Telephony), and multiple free programs [by others](http://directory.fsf.org/category/tel/) also already do the basics.
        When free software makes it possible to do full-featured VOIP while maintaining your
        freedom, that will be a real change. 

Replacing Skype with free software is an FSF [High Priority Project](http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority-projects/#skypereplacement).
