### Booth


![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/original_img_2396-150x150.jpg)This Year you will find our awesome booth in **hall 7.2b, booth 153**. We'll show you all the new and exciting things that are happening in and around the openSUSE Project and will answer all the questions you might have. Grab a copy of our newest distribution release, 11.4 and see it in action. See how the new [GNOME3](http://www.gnome3.org/) interface feels, learn how [KDE Plasma](http://www.kde.org/workspaces) helps you to be productive and discover how you can easily get the newest desktops. Let us show to you what it means to roll along with [Tumbleweed](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed), our rolling release or participate in one of our many workshops that will teach you how you can make a difference in the free and open source software community. We're looking forward to meet you in Berlin!

Vincent, openSUSE Member, recently retired GNOME Release Team member and long time FOSS Hacker, will discuss cross-distribution collaboration, with examples of  successes and failures.

Or openSUSE's community manager [Jos Poortvliet](http://blog.jospoortvliet.com/)'s talk about **"[openSUSE 11.4 impression - more than you think!](http://www.linuxtag.org/2011/de/program/freies-vortragsprogramm/popup/vortragsdetails.html?talkid=427)"**.

### Workshops


The [openSUSE Boosters](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Boosters_team) will deliver small workshops on the booth where they will **teach you how to contribute in various ways to the openSUSE project** and the free and open source software community. Let experienced Linux packagers explain to you how you can roll and release your software, or the software you need, with the [Build Service](http://build.opensuse.org). Have a seasoned designer hold your hand while you take your first steps into the world of graphics design with free tools like Inkscape. Or learn how you can extend the GNOME and KDE desktops with small apps written in [Javascript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) or [Qt Quick](http://qt.nokia.com/qtquick/).
