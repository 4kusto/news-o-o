## Kicking off


In a week from today, on Thursday the 24th of April the conference kicks offwith a welcome get together at [the Sesame Tavern](http://www.sesame.hr/tovjerna.html) which is just 200 meters away from the venue. Standing with your back to the venue you will turn to your right walking slightly down hill toward the old town of Dubrovnik. Approximately 200 meters down the street you will see the Sesame sign on your right. The tavern is located at [Branitelja Dubrovnika 23, 20000 Dubrovnik](http://goo.gl/maps/XTdiL). We will start at 6:00 P.M. and hope to see you there!

## The sessions


We are very excited about the excellent talks and workshops that have been submitted and that we were able to select to make up this year's conference program. Registration opens on Friday the 25th of April at 8:30 in the  morning and registration will open each day thereafter at 9:00 A.M. The program kicks off with the Opening Keynote by the openSUSE board on Friday moring at 10 and should keep you busy until we end the conference around lunch time on Monday the 28th. Between the start of the schedule on Friday and the close on Monday the speakers will deliver close to 70 hours worth of content in various formats in 60 sessions. There is also room for on the spot hack sessions and BoF meetings for those that need a bit more than just standing in the hallway.

### Relaxation


With all the material being presented we will not loose sight that a bit of relaxation is needed as well. The conference party on Sunday evening starts at 7:00 P.M. (19:00) at the [EastWest Pub](http://ew-dubrovnik.com/), which is located right at the beach at Frana Supila 4. The pub is just south of the old town and it takes about 15 to 20 minutes to walk there from the venue. [On the way](http://goo.gl/maps/yUoGN) you will pass Sesame where everything starts on Thursday evening.



## Beginnings and endings


On Monday around noon we will start to pack up and say goodbye for another year at oSC15 in **......** for this you will need to wait until the keynote on Friday.

Check out the schedule [here](https://conference.opensuse.org/osem/conference/osc14/schedule), find more details on [the conference website](http://conference.opensuse.org) and plan your participation. We will see you in Dubrovnic next week!
