The openSUSE Wiki Team Meeting will take place on Sunday, the 6th of December 2009 at 19.00 UTC. See all time zones on the [Fixed Time World Clock](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=6&month=12&year=2009&hour=19&min=0&sec=0&p1=0). The meeting will be held in IRC on the #opensuse-wiki channel on Freenode.

This is our last Team Meeting discussing the Wiki Usability Concept before we actually start the transition to the new Wiki instance. Everyone interested is certainly welcome to join us. The agenda (working draft) is available [here](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-wiki/2009-12/msg00006.html).

Not familiar with IRC? A good overview can be found at [irchelp.org](http://www.irchelp.org/). This site is not affiliated with openSUSE.
