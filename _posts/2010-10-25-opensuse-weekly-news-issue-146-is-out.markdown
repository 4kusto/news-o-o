"Next thursday I™m flying to Nuremberg for the openSUSE Conference. I™m arriving somewhere between 14:00 and 15:00 considering that nothing strange happens (ex: like a snow storm).  

  

 For me it™s the first time I attend to FOSS event from such caliber. I™m having my own expectations about it, and it will for sure help me in the work I™ve been doing. I™m also looking forward to meet ˜_the_™ people to which I have interacted with during the last times online. (...)"

"This Wednesday the 2nd openSUSE Conference 2010 opens its doors and we are very happy to announce the third keynote today.  

  

 The Desktop and the Cloud “ Thoughts about Freedom on Thursday morning at 9:30 am. How relevant is the desktop in a world where computing is happening in the cloud?  

  

 The motto for our conference is one of the basic ideas of openSUSE: Collaboration across borders. This is why we are especially proud to have this subject addressed in a keynote by two key people from the free desktop world: Cornelius Schumacher, president of KDE e.V., and Vincent Untz, former president of the GNOME Foundation. (...)" 




####  [Sascha Manns: Live from the openSUSE Conference 2010 in Nuremberg](http://saigkill.wordpress.com/2010/10/20/live-from-the-opensuse-conference-2010-in-nuremberg/)




"Today it starts: The new openSUSE Conference. We have over 240 Registrations before start. Some Registrants sleeping in the Hotel from the Berufsbildungswerk. I™m living in the third floor. And i am happy, a clean and convenient room.  

  

 Today the Conference starts at 09:30 with Henne Vogelsangs Talk žGet your ass up!. He motivates us, not just to talk about what is to do. We should just doing anything and have fun.  

  

 The next Talk i™ve listened was Lubos Lunaks talk about žEasy multi “ distribution package builds with the buid service. Lubos explained us, how to use the kde-obs-generator. This Program needs just a singe INFO File with the needed Inforations, and the Program creates from that a *.spec File and two debian*.control Files. So we have all for building Packages for Fedora, Mandriva, Debian and Ubuntu. This talk motivates me to try it out. Maybe i can support in Future my Packages who i maintain in more Destinations.

####  [openSUSE ass-kickin™ keynote](https://news.opensuse.org/2010/10/20/opensuse-ass-kickin-keynote/)


"As 260 fans of openSUSE descended upon Nuremberg, the second annual openSUSE Conference began at 9:30 sharp with Hendrik Henne Vogelsang delivering a very important and poignant message for us all..  

  




In Henne™s keynote, Get your ass up!, he talks about where we are and how we can move forward as a Project. We™re in a unique position, Henne said. He asked the audience how old they thought SUSE was. Nobody guessed correctly “ it is 18 years. Debian is 17, Red hat 16 “ SUSE really has been around a long time. Yet it has only been a really open project for a few years “ Henne considers the opening of Factory during 2009 the real milestone here." 




####  [Adrian Schröter: Fotostream from openSUSE Conference 2010](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/10/21/fotostream-from-opensuse-conference-2010/)




"[Yet another foto stream](http://www.flickr.com/photos/adrianschroeter/5101297353/) from the openSUSE conference. You see the desktop leads from KDE and Gnome (Cornelius Schumacher and Vincent Untz) giving a talk about the past and future of the free desktop, Stephan Kulow about the future of the distribution, Bernhard Wiedemann about QA testing and so on.  

  

 Most important may be the presentation of the openSUSE board (mainly by Pascal Bleser) how they plan to found an independent foundation for openSUSE as non-profit organization. An important rule of that foundation is that it is independent of any company (no majority of Novell here) but can handle sponsoring, partnering and trademark questions.  

  

 We had also very filled rooms during the OBS talks, but I was unable to take pictures at that point of time unfortunately ;)  

  

 You can skip to the end and leave a response. Pinging is currently not allowed." 




####  [Sebastian Kügler: openSUSE conference 2010](http://vizzzion.org/blog/2010/10/opensuse-conference-2010/)




"These October days, I™m spending in Nürnberg in Southern Germany to attend the openSUSE conference. My role here is three-fold, first and foremost I am here as a representative of open-slx, my employer who sells products and services based on top of openSUSE. Then, I™m a KDE ambassador. Finally, I™m also getting more and more involved with the openSUSE team, getting to know many people and learning about challenges and opportunities this community faces. (...)"

"I'm in Nuremberg since Sunday, and the openSUSE Conference started yesterday. So I have already tons of interesting bits to tell. But the really important part is:  

  

[![20101021 lizard-lounge.png](http://en.opensuse.org/images/thumb/7/7b/20101021_lizard-lounge.png/300px-20101021_lizard-lounge.png)](http://en.opensuse.org/File:20101021_lizard-lounge.png)  

  

 Thanks to B1 Systems for sponsoring the party tonight!" 




####  [Jos Poortvliet: oSC party fun](http://nowwhatthe.blogspot.com/2010/10/osc-party-fun.html)




"Wow, third day of the openSUSE conference already. Feels like the conference started an hour ago, every second has been busy. Well, almost. I'm currently enjoying my morning-thee, feeling a bit bad about the fact that 5 minutes ago the Friday keynote started... Will get a cab soon to not miss all of it ;-)  

  

 Last night we had the party - which was very, very cool. Green lighting, red and green drinks and I've met many nice 'old toads' (the openSUSE branded beer). Which contributes to me really loving my thee right now. (...)" 




####  [Will Stephenson: Video: KDE people at openSUSE Conference 2010](http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/4343)




"I couldn't resist snapping as many KDE folk at the openSUSE conference as I could, and editing them together into: [a short video](http://bille.blip.tv/file/4281044/). (...)"

"Wednesday at the conference, Smeegol master Andrew Funkypenguin Wafaa was given the stage by Michael Meeks who was supposed to talk about MeeGo.

####  [Klaas Freitag: openSUSE Conference](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/10/23/opensuse-conference/)




"I am home from the openSUSE Conference 2010 and finally landed on the sofa. I don™t know why conferences are so exhausting, but they are for me. My brain slowly becomes sorted again and starts to reflect what happened on the conference. Wow, I can say that I didn™t expect it to become such a great event. There were so many interesting and enthusiastic discussions about topics concerning the openSUSE distribution or about things you can do under the openSUSE umbrella. (...)" 




####  [Will Stephenson: Upstream holiday](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/10/24/upstream-holiday/)




"The openSUSE Conference went really well last week. There was an amazing range of material and the audience™s participation in every talk I attended showed that the openSUSE project has moved past the show-and-tell presentations of a company and its customers to a community using the event to share knowledge between its members and develop. As part of the openSUSE Boosters team, I was in it up to my neck. On Wednesday I started with a talk on image building for application authors which was well attended but I think I should tweak towards users™ needs as there weren™t many app authors present. I gave a talk about the upcoming KDE features that will be in openSUSE 11.4 on Thursday, because openSUSE 11.3 had KDE 4.4 but due to the 3 month difference in both projects™ release cycles, openSUSE 11.4 will have the KDE 4.6 releases of platform, workspaces and apps. That equals a lot of changes, so I summarized them for people who don™t read Planet KDE as avidly as I do. The Lizard Lounge event in the SUSE building on Thursday night gave everyone a chance to catch their breath drinking limited edition Old Toad SUSE beer. (...)" 




####  [Sirko Kemter: openSUSE Conference 2010](http://karl-tux-stadt.de/ktuxs/?p=2820)




"I am finally home from openSUSE Conference v2.0 and now I have time to write an article about it. Conference started for me on tuesday with my arrival. I have only 240km ride to Nuremberg but with train you need nearly 4 hours. For the first evening I joined one of the planned social dinners. So I went with some others to a chinese restaurant nearby. (...)" 




####  [Thomas Thym: openSUSE conference 2010 is over](http://ungethym.blogspot.com/2010/10/opensuse-conference-2010-is-over.html)




"openSUSE conference is over. It was an amazing and exhausting time. And the most important thing I learned was: The openSUSE project is a commuity. Of cause I meet many community members employed by Novell. But also many contributors NOT payed by that sponsor. The project is moving more and more into the direction of independence (e.g. with it's community based new strategy).  

  

 I was suspisious myself when I choose my distro some time ago. Shall I really try openSUSE, with all the deals the main sponsor is doing? From now on I am sure that these prejudices were wrong. (...)" 




####  [Christian Boltz: Keysigning made easy](http://blog.cboltz.de/archives/57-Keysigning-made-easy.html)




"At the openSUSE conference I heard many interesting talks and met lots of nice people from the openSUSE community. I also took part at the keysigning party. To avoid that everybody has to start from scratch, here is a HowTo sign keys efficiently with caff." 




####  [Martin Mohring: OBS 2.1: Status of SuperH (sh4) support with QEMU](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/10/24/obs-2-1-status-of-superh-sh4-support-with-qemu/)




"With established ARM support in OBS the as well as emulated MIPS and PowerPC is getting more mature, the last big embedded architecture not working in OBS with QEMU user mode was SH4. QEMU developers community had done a lot of work in improving QEMU user mode during the last months, so I can proudly present with currently only a few patches to QEMU git master OBS builds working with the SH4 port of Debian Sid. The new QEMU 0.13 released recently is a big milestone for this. Another news is that I had fixed the bugs in Virtual Machine builds (build script) when using them with some architectures like PowerPC 32bit and SH4. So now also the combination of using for example KVM (XEN should also work) in a worker together with ARM, MIPS, PowerPC and SH4 is working. The appropriate fixes are in one of the next build script releases (if not even released already now with OBS 2.1, I have to check that). You can select architecture sh4³ with OBS 2.1 and also start a scheduler with sh4³."

I have only 240km ride to Nuremberg but with train you need nearly 4 hours. For the first evening I joined one of the planned social dinners. So I went with some others to a chinese restaurant nearby. I was not really happy about the situation to have two of them but Will saw not my announcement on the project mailinglist and planned a second one. But some of the KDE people from the other dinner joined us later. Personnally I like such things so I think we should plan such a thing next conference from the beginning on. Next day the conference started with Hennes kicking ass keynote and ended with my talk about free and open movies and of course I showed some of them. I write an second article about that and of course I load up my slides and give the URLs to the movies I showed there. Between that I attend only a few talks and sessions, one of them was the session about the foundation. Second day I had also not a lot of time to attend sessions, but that means not I did nothing, I had a lot of conversations with people I do work and thats more important for me. I load up some photos and did some tweets and thats what I tried to do, give the part of our community the not can attend the conference a view whats going on there. The day ended with the Lizard Lounge the social event of the openSUSE Conference." ====[[http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/10/24/upstream-holiday/](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/10/24/upstream-holiday/) The openSUSE Conference went really well last week.

The Lizard Lounge event in the SUSE building on Thursday night gave everyone a chance to catch their breath drinking limited edition Old Toad SUSE beer. On Friday I gave a spontaneous BoF on KWin™s current and upcoming features. Can you name the four ways to show your desktop in 4.5? I only had 3 until a member of the audience pointed out a 4th. And yesterday I supported Chani™s workshop on developing for Plasma using Javascript and QML, which piqued the audience™s interest by showing how KDE™s high-level services like the Plasma applets framework and the KConfig configuration storage library add value to the glamour of QML and QGraphicsView. To enable all of the audience to participate, I™d prepared another live image, this time an SDK based on KDE trunk, Qt 4.7 and latest Qt Designer 2.0.1 with all the headers and developer docu on board. This paid off, as unlike at Akademy, most people didn™t have developer builds ready to go on their laptops. Within minutes we had copies booting from everyone™s USB sticks and people were working through the included git repository of tutorials prepared by Chani, making flags change colour on click and saving applet state using only a schema file and a Qt Designer config UI."

There were so many interesting and enthusiastic discussions about topics concerning the openSUSE distribution or about things you can do under the openSUSE umbrella. The fun side of community and technology was inspiring people all over, in opposite to some situations I remember on the last years conference where we had to deal with unpleasant topics. This seemed to have completely went away, instead people were aiming to solve problems together in a constructive way or, even more fun, worked on new things without so called stop-energy."

[http://rtfm.opensuse.org](http://rtfm.opensuse.org/)  

  

 Thank you guys! I like the thrilling name. ;-)  

  

 It™s a static page (at the moment?) and collects the current documentation from several products and projects. Probably you will see more to come in the next weeks.  

  

 Have fun!" 




####  [OSC2010 Key note “ From Developers to Users and back](https://news.opensuse.org/2010/10/21/osc2010-key-note-from-developers-to-users-and-back/)




"Frank Karlitschek will show us on Saturday at 9:30 the project he™s working on to simplify the way software gets to users. Frank has deep knowledge in open source communities as member of the KDE e.V. Board of Directors and eg. as driver behind the open-PC project and some more activities he™s doing. What makes developers and users happy ? Currently developers create great software solving the user™s problem. But getting the software in a consumable way, simple, fast and efficient to the user nowadays still comes with some challenges. And marketing of the software isn™t covered either yet. So, maybe this situation could be improved. This is the first public presentation of on ongoing project to radically simplify the work for the developers and make new applications available for end users in just a few minutes. If you have not registered for the conference yet, please do so here to assure we have enough chairs. Our yearly conference is free of charge, offers interesting talks and gives you the best chance to meet many cool people in person!" 




####  [Smeegol at oSC](https://news.opensuse.org/2010/10/23/smeegol-at-osc/)




"Wednesday at the conference, Smeegol master Andrew Funkypenguin Wafaa was given the stage by Michael Meeks who was supposed to talk about MeeGo. Meeks claimed that he™d rather have someone on the stage who actually knew what he was talking about, hence Andrew had to explain himself to the audience. **What is special about Smeegol** According to Andrew he developed Smeegol in part because he thought he could do better by building upon openSUSE. openSUSE has a real ˜open™ builservice, where anyone can easily contribute code and improvements to the packages where MeeGo has a much more closed development process. Moreover, openSUSE offers a whole ecosystem of services like a wiki and a bugtracker; and more importantly, openSUSE has a huge community of experts in a variety of area™s who can answer questions and contribute solutions to the many issues that MeeGo faces. Andrew has, for many applications and components in Smeegol, taken advantage of existing openSUSE packages thus offering NetworkManager (which offers proper encryption support, AdHoc networking, VPN etc ) and a more up-to-date Chromium. Andrew also spend considerable time in getting more social networking features to work in Smeegol “ like Facebook and twitter."

"Having an awesome time here at the conference - esp last night with the Movie Night, the Movies were cool. As was the beer during and afterwards...  

  

 During the day I followed talk by Lubos Lunak about the Build Service as I wanted to learn more about it. As I made notes I decided to share them :D  

  

 In the introduction Lubos shared that apparently you have to package each application by hand - however, automatic downloading of random tarballs from the internet and turning them into packages for all linux distributions on distrowatch.org is planned for OBS 3.0! (...)"

"With established ARM support in OBS the as well as emulated MIPS and PowerPC is getting more mature, the last big embedded architecture not working in OBS with QEMU user mode was SH4. QEMU developers community had done a lot of work in improving QEMU user mode during the last months, so I can proudly present with currently only a few patches to QEMU git master OBS builds working with the SH4 port of Debian Sid. The new QEMU 0.13 released recently is a big milestone for this. (...)"

"Yesterday evening, I added the first animation to the KWin [dashboard effect](http://www.andreas-demmer.de/en/2010/06/24/dashboard-effekt-plugin-stand-der-dinge/): Saturation and brightness of the background do now change over a configurable time span when the dashboard appears.

 I posted [the according patch](http://reviewboard.kde.org/r/5658/) to the KDE review board. If everything works out fine, the patch will be in trunk for KDE SC 4.6 before code freeze."

"This idea is made to make installing from source easiest as possible. Many tools to generating makefile (configure) uses pkg-config a lot. Pkg-config returns complirer flags and path to include files.  

  

 When the package devel/header files isn't insralled, pkg-config only returns error code. We should modify pkg-config to search devel packages in the repository(like cnf). We can integrated zypper, but integrating PackageKit instead is also a good choice. The behaviour can be simply: displaying package name to install on error out. Not always package name are matched to name suggested by configuration script.  

  

 I can also imagine to write complete replacement for make, which modify system path to directory with special wrapper for compilers/pkg-config."

"pam-config write the files /etc/pam.d/common-***-pc. If a user want to use its own configuration, he has to remove the symlink from /etc/pam.d/common-*** to the -pc files and create the common-*** file with his configuration to prevent pam-config from removing his configuration.  

  

 But this is nowhere explained. It should be added to the pam-config manpage.  

  

 Additionally we should think about a way to prevent overwriting manual changes to the service files, if --service is used."

"Yogyakarta is one of the tourism destination in Indonesia. The unique Javanise tradition blend with some acculturation from outside culture. Recently I was asked by the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology and Office of Education, Youth and Sport of Yogyakarta to help them to prepare the computer lab for elementary and junior high school in Yogyakarta Province “ Indonesia.  

  

 Well, this is the tough job. I work with some expert, teacher and education strategist to prepare the e-learning system. We should prepare learning/teaching material in digital format, train the teacher to use authoring tools and operating system, and prepare the schools to be ready to receive the PC™s. This government initiative will involve 500 schools in 3 years. Every school that involve in this program will receive 21 PCs.  

  

 We select openSUSE Li-f-e as the operating system in every pc. The selection is not because I™m an openSUSE member but we come to the conclusion that openSUSE Li-f-e is the most complete and well prepare distribution for education (well, I convince other expert, some of them are Ph.D, he..he¦). This year there are 110 schools involve in this program, this means another new 2310 openSUSE installation and more than 4000 new users if we assume that every PC will be used by 2 students.

"As of February 2010, Apache served over 54.46% of all websites and over 66% of the million busiest. It is available on a wide variety of platforms including Linux, Mac OS X, Windows and BSD. One of the key factors behind Apache HTTP Server™s success is its modular architecture. The Apache HTTP Server core is very simple and doesn™t do much. The default distribution of HTTP Server contains the core and a set of core Apache Modules that handle most of the web-server-related operations. This modular architecture presents several benefits. For example, instead of running the full server, one can enable only the modules that one will use; this way one can run the most efficient version of the HTTP Server without changing the server code. Another benefit of modular architecture is extensibility. Apache as a web server community implements a defined feature set approved by the community, but that may or may not be enough for everybody.

"This blog post is long overdued and I apologized to those who had encouraged me to do so earlier and I procrastinated.  

  

 With SLES 11 SP1, officially available earlier in June 2010, KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is officially supported in addition to the more mature Xen virtualization (since 2006). You can install both hypervisors on the same installation of SLES 11 SP1 but you can only choose to use one or the other and not both at the same time (reboot required to switch)."

####  [Pavol Rusnak: Why is pkg-config the best thing since sliced bread](http://stick.gk2.sk/blog/2010/10/why-is-pkg-config-the-best-thing-since-sliced-bread/)




"For those of you who haven™t met pkg-config yet a short introduction from its project page: 


pkg-config is a helper tool used when compiling applications and libraries. It helps you insert the correct compiler options on the command line so an application can use gcc -o test test.c `pkg-config --libs --cflags glib-2.0` for instance, rather than hard-coding values on where to find glib (or other libraries). It is language-agnostic, so it can be used for defining the location of documentation tools, for instance. 


More and more projects are using pkg-config already, but there is still a very high number of projects that don™t. This post tries to describe why using pkg-config is a good idea."

"On the train back from the openSUSE conference, I read an article about improvements in Plasma 4.5 in the German edition of Linux Magazin. The author noticed the re-designed notification area with its more consistent and clean look, but also mentioned that the clock looks visually somewhat outdated in the panel now. Fair enough, most of the notification area has seen a bunch of iterations over their looks, but the digital clock didn™t really receive much visual love other than bugfixes in alignment and layout of the clock. I thought a bit about what would make the digital clock look better, and identified two things: the full bleed color sticks out a bit, and the clock looks flat compared to its neighbours in the panel.

"In various blog comments, my visitors kept complaining about the Flash headlines. This has come to an end right now!  

  

 When I relaunched the page for the last time, I have choosen the DIN font for the header, navigation and headlines. Because of DIN being a commercial font, the only valid way to use it was by embedding it as Flash font with the help of sIFR. This technology only had few drawbacks because it had full fallbacks for browsers without Flash and the headlines were selectable, too. Of course, a native solution would have been better. And this is, what I did yesterday!"

####  [TildeHash/Jacob Barkdull: State of Firefox 4.0 on GNU+Linux](http://www.tildehash.com/?article=state-of-firefox-4-0-on-gnu-linux)




"So we've probably all seen the mock-ups for Firefox 4.0 by now, but has any of it been implemented? In the Windows version, yes. On the GNU+Linux version, partially. And it looks like it's going to stay that way. I'm going to show you what's different in the current development version (nightly 4.0b8pre) from 3.6.  

  

 First up: Firefox 4.0 has great support for the new HTML5 specifications like CSS3, Canvas, Offline Web Applications, Drag-and-Drop interaction, Geolocation, SVG, Animated SVG, Video tag, Audio tag, WebM, and so much more. HTML5 is now very popular on the web, but because many people use older web browsers or web browsers that don't support such new features, web sites are designed to work despite a lack of support for HTML5. So while these are great features, you might not notice them or necessarily want to use them, I will not be talking about them much here. This is the state of Firefox 4.0 on GNU+Linux."

 Linux founder Linus Torvalds formally released the 2.6.36 kernel this week nearly three months after the release of the 2.6.35 kernel.  

  

 AppArmor has been in use by Linux distributions since at least 2006 when Novell first open sourced the code as a rival option to SELinux which has been championed by Red Hat. Ubuntu picked up AppArmor in 2007 with the 7.10 Gutsy Gibbon release. (...)"

"It's a well-established truth in marketing that brands aren't about products or even experiences ” they are about people. Create a community in which your user feels at home, where their questions are answered,their voices heard and their contributions appreciated, and half of your marketing work is done. It doesn't matter how clever your social media feed is if you don't have a core of humanity at the centre of your project.  

  

 The openSUSE conference in Nürnberg, with a theme of "collaboration across borders," will highlight this pivotal aspect of Free and Open Source Software development. Although a distribution-sponsored conference, this event will involve an extended cross-section of the FOSS world, including other distributions, desktop projects and upstream developers. (...)"

"From the 'Sky Isn't Falling' files:  

  

 The Number Resource Organization (NRO) announced today the less than 5 percent of the IPv4 address space now remains.  

  

 So what?  

  

 We've been hearing about IPv4 address space depletion for years and various organizations have kept trying to predict the year we'd 'run out' of address spaces. The reality is that year after year IPv4 has continued to stay alive - even as pundits proclaim its death. The fact that less than 5 percent of IPv4 address remain is not a cause for U.S. based enterprises or consumers to be concerned - the Internet is not running out of IP addresses as some mainstream media might proclaim - you can go about your business as usual.
