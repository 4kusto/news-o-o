Hey ho, we have a few new mailing lists available.

To discuss openSUSE usage on the different virtualization products like [Qemu/KVM](http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/), [XEN](http://www.xen.org) or [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org) subscribe to [opensuse-virtual](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-virtual). If you are one of our many users from the Czech Republic (nazdar lidi!) you should subscribe to [opensuse-cz](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-cz) and discuss openSUSE with other users there. A little while ago we created [opensuse-features](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-features) that broadcasts every change related to openSUSE in the feature database, [opensuse-nl ](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-nl)for users from the Netherlands and some new translation lists: [German](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-translation-de), [Spanish](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-translation-es), [Russian](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-translation-ru), [Slovakian](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-translation-sk)  and [Hungarian](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-translation-hu). For more information on how to use these lists or what other mailing lists we have head over to the [Mailinglist page on our wiki](http://en.opensuse.org/Communicate/Mailinglists).
