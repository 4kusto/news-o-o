[![](/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0007_1.jpg)openSUSE Conference](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC19) 2019 in Nuremberg, Germany, is just four short weeks away.  The conference will be from May 24 -26 at the ZBau and will start at 9:30 a.m. with a [keynote from Thomas Di Giacomo,](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC19/program/proposals/2522) SUSE's President of Engineering, Product and Innovation.

To prepare for oSC19, there are a few things to know before going.


#### Money


See what the Euro conversion rate is at [http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/](http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/). Keep your receipt when you convert money; you can get the same rate when you return to the same exchange where you converted the money into euros.


#### Arriving


Nuremberg is a smaller sized airport. People can take the [U-Bahn](https://www.vgn.de/en/tickets/4-trip-ticket/) to downtown Nuremberg. It only takes about 10 minutes by subway to get to the main station. From the airport, you will want to take U2 to downtown main station (Hauptbahnhof). One-way tickets are about 3 euro. Buy a one-way ticket at a vending machines. A 4-trip pass is 11 euro. An all-day pass is about 12 euro.

You can take a taxi to the hotel, but it’s just as easy to take the subway. Taxi stands are right outside the airport entrance. Costs will typically run between 10 and 20 euro. NOTE - Uber, Lyft and other share riding apps are not available in Nuremberg.

Almost all hotels do not run shuttle services, so don’t expect the hotel to pick you up.


#### Public Transportation


You can get around Nuremberg easily with public transportation. Again, one-way tickets are about 3 euro. The location of the Z-Bau is Frankenstr. 200. To get there, take U1 from the Nuremberg Hbf (Hauptbahnhof); it is just three subway stops from Nuremberg Hbf. Use U1 from the Bahnhof going toward Largwasser and get off on **Franken Straße and walk to Franken Straße 200** (9-minute walk to the **Z Bau). **If you reached Hasenbuck, you have gone one station too far. https://www.vgn.de/liniennetze/schienennetz_nuernberg_furth/

Buy a one-way ticket at a vending machines; bring coins.

There are several different public transportation passes you can get during the openSUSE Conference. Please visit [https://www.vgn.de/en/tickets/](https://www.vgn.de/en/tickets/) for more information.


#### Parking


For those of you who drive, please note that you will need to park in a parking garage when downtown. A map at [http://www.parkhaus-nuernberg.de/parkhaeuser/kartenansicht.html](http://www.parkhaus-nuernberg.de/parkhaeuser/kartenansicht.html) shows all the parkhaus in Nuremberg. Parking at the Z-Bau is free. If you want to park the car there overnight and take public transportation, that is probably your best option.


#### Plugs / Power


<!-- more -->

There will be power at oSC19, but to make sure you can power your electronics, you will need a Type C plug (Europe) or converter connection from your type plug to the Type C plug. Most electronics are 110/220, so there won’t be a need for a 110 to 220 power transformer.


#### Pre-conference Party


A pre-conference party is planned for May 23 at the[ Kater Murr](http://kater-murr.com/) at 7 p.m.
