On the first pic you see the car i have, the big blue bag is where we planed to have Zonker, but unfortunately the car was to stuffed .. So i drove alone to Berlin, Zonker took the train. The booth setup was chaos like usual, at 20:00 we where finished with no big issues. We already had a lot of visitors, and we wonder, and are happy, that there are a lot of new Linux users. Everybody is impressed about our new packagemanagement, and the other features we will have in openSUSE 11.0. So far the systems are working very well with Beta3, even KDE4 runs stable. Ok, back to the booth, more tomorrow ...
