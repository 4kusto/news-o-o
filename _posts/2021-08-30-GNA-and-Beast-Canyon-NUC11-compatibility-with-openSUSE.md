While focused on the [openSUSE Innovator initiative](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:INNOVATORS) as an openSUSE member and official [Intel oneAPI](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi.html) innovator, I tested the Beast Canyon NUC 11 machine on openSUSE [Leap 15.3 ](https://software.opensuse.org/distributions/leap) and [Tumbleweed](https://software.opensuse.org/distributions/tumbleweed). With all the work, we made available in the SDB an article on how to use the GNA Technologie on the openSUSE platform. More information can be found at <https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Install_GNA_in_NUC_Beast_Canyon>.

[Beast Canyon ](https://overclock3d.net/news/systems/intel_s_beast_canyon_nuc_11_extreme_will_support_full-length_graphics_cards/1) (still on pre-order) is the highest-performing Intel® NUC available today. Beast Canyon is the evolution of Intel's modular gaming mini PC, a more compact gaming PC than most gamers could dream of building on their own. The equipment in some models has the Core i9-11900KB processor with the GNA feature: Gaussian & Neural Accelerator Library.

Intel® Gaussian & Neural Accelerator is a low-power neural coprocessor for continuous inference at the edge. For more information, visit : <https://github.com/intel/gna>
