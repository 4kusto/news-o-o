![Tumbleweed-black-green](/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Tumbleweed-black-green.png)Since the last update, [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) had two snapshots.

Snapshot [20160505](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-05/msg00093.html) and [20160508](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-05/msg00131.html) brought quite a few goodies for Tumbleweed users.

[Firefox 46](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/46) and [GNOME 3.20.2](https://help.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/3.20/) were in the [20160505 snapshot](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-05/msg00093.html) along with some other packages like [git 2.8.2](https://git-scm.com/), glib-networking 2.48.1 and a huge update to ostree in version 2016.5.

The most recent snapshot updated the Linux Kernel to [4.5.3](https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.5.3) and Plasma updated to version [5.6.3](https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.6.3.php). Bluedevil 5, breeze and hexchat were also updated in the [20160508 snapshot](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-05/msg00131.html). Samba had an enormous list about bugs and fixes in the email that lists the details of the [20160508 snapshot](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-05/msg00131.html).

Plans for the new GNU Compiler Collection in a Tumbleweed snapshot is at least three to four weeks away because of a huge update stack that will be made when GCC 6 makes it into Tumbleweed. Pre-testing in private staging has shown that GCC 6 should build smoothly in the various stages that lead to a Tumbleweed snapshot, but that remains to be seen until a snapshot with GCC 6 is at the users' fingertips.

As for Qt 5.6, the bug that broke YaST appears to be swarming between two chopsticks - it took forever to catch and fix. However, as Dominique shared on Saturday, [a fix is found and merged](http://dominique.leuenberger.net/blog/2016/05/opensuse-tumbleweed-review-of-the-weeks-201619/) so the 5.6.x release is coming soon! Perhaps we'll wait for 5.6.1 as that should be out soon.
