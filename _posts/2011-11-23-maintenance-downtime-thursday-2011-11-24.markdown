We need some maintenance downtime to work on the following issues:



	
  * [![Failed geeko](http://en.opensuse.org/images/4/43/Failgeeko.png)](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Downtime)fix storage problems on Build Service machines

	
  * increase network subnet mask for external available servers (means: we are growing ;-)

	
  * exchange some SSL certificates on servers delivering content via HTTPS




We are trying to get everything done during the standard infrastructure window:




**Thursday (2011-11-24), 08:00 - 10:00 CET (7:00 -9:00 UTC)
**




but some services might need a bit longer (for example the schedulers of the Build Service).
