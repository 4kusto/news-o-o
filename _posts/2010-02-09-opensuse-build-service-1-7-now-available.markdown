Today, the openSUSE Build Service team released the latest version of the openSUSE Build Service, a tool that provides software developers with the ability to create and release software for openSUSE, SUSE Linux Enterprise and other Linux distributions, including Fedora, Red Hat, Mandriva, Debian and Ubuntu. The openSUSE Build Service allows developers to create packages, software stacks or even a whole distribution as well as use and integrate them with other open source components.
Key features of the 1.7 release include:



	
  * [A new attribute system](http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service/Concepts/AttributeStorage) - A flexible system that stores information related to projects or packages. This gives a good overview and enables teams or individuals to use the openSUSE Build Service as database for their information.

	
  * Faster build speeds â€“ The SAT Solver speeds up the dependency calculation by factor of 1,000, which means a package change submitted to the build service starts building in seconds instead of minutes.

	
  * Customized branding - For local instances of the openSUSE Build Service, this release offers the ability to add custom branding and the Web user interface (UI) now supports individual themes.

	
  * An [openSUSE Build Service server appliance](http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service/OBS-Appliance) - Built as hard disk image and live CD, this appliance allows users to run the system from a USB stick and just replace it with a new version on update without losing the data they have submitted to the server.

	
  * In addition to bug fixes, other improvements include a request system that now offers [a review mechanism](http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service/Concepts/Review), improved status information (package build dependencies, repository status, etc.), and improved merge handling of sources for automated conflict resolution.
