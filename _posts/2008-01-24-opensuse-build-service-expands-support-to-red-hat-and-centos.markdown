The [openSUSE Build Service](http://opensuse.org/Build_Service), an innovative framework that provides an infrastructure for software developers to easily create and compile packages for multiple Linux distributions, [has extended its support](http://www.novell.com/news/press/the-opensuse-build-service-expands-support-to-red-hat-and-centos/) to build packages for CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The openSUSE Build Service already supports several Linux distributions including openSUSE, Debian, Fedora, Mandriva, SUSE Linux Enterprise and Ubuntu.

_ "As its name suggests, the openSUSE project is committed to choice and opposed to the exclusion of innovation simply because it may have originated in another project,"_ said Michael Loeffler, openSUSE product manager at Novell._ "By adding support to build packages for CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the openSUSE Build Service makes it even easier to build packages across multiple Linux distributions, thus further enabling innovative ideas to spread quickly throughout the free and open source software community. As we seek to streamline and improve collaboration between all Linux developers, the openSUSE Build Service continues to innovate and improve the way packages are built by providing a common framework that works with any Linux distribution."_

Huge thanks and congratulations go to Adrian Schr√∂ter and the openSUSE [Build Service team](http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service_Team) for implementing this great new capability.
