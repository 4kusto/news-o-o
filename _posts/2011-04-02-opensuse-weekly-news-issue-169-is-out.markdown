[Andreas Jaeger: openSUSE Release versioning “ Poll on last three options](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/03/28/opensuse-release-versioning-poll-on-last-three-options/)

The poll on SurveyMonkey on how to version the openSUSE distribution release is now
      closed, you can see the results [here](http://www.surveymonkey.com/sr.aspx?sm=ZMyUjEimqUeLGFeX8Kmq_2baNaoqX9TRhoTN0KA_2fPlQxQ_3d). The winner is the old school (like currently but only counting the right
      number until 3), followed by Fedora style (just integers) and Ubuntu style (2 digits year
      . 2 digits month).

The openSUSE members only poll is now live on [connect.opensuse.org](https://connect.opensuse.org/pg/polls/read/a_jaeger/12979/opensuse-release-versioning) until April 04, 2011.

[Review “ openSUSE 11.4 and the much improved XFCE 4.8](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/03/28/review-opensuse-11-4-and-the-much-improved-xfce-4-8/)

Just a few months ago, the XFCE project announcedÃ½[XFCE 4.8](http://www.xfce.org/about/news/?post=1295136000),Ã½the result of over 2
      years of hard work. This desktop, one of the four official desktops of [openSUSE 11.4](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/03/10/opensuse-11-4/), brings many
      new features. If you™re not having fun in the desktops provided by KDE or GNOME you should
      have a close look at XFCE (or the lightweight LXDE). To show you how it™s done, I checked out
      XFCE and wrote about my experience.

FigureÂ 1.Â The default XFCE desktop

![The default XFCE desktop]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/desktop-300x168.png)

  


**Testing XFCE 4.8 on openSUSE 11.4**

To test XFCE FigureÂ 1, The default XFCE desktop I went into [SUSE Studio](http://susestudio.com) and
      created an XFCE 4.8 image. After some clicking around (slimming a standard GNOME down to XFCE)
      I had built a hard disk image. If you do this yourself, notice that by default, SUSE Studio
      does not install ˜recommended™ packages from patterns. This can be enabled “ and you surely
      should do that if you want a decent XFCE!

The ability to just write an image to an usb disk and have it resize itself to the size of
      the whole stick at first boot is awesome. You can just install software and in general won™t
      notice you work on an USB stick! That is truly a portable OS¦ (...)

[Michal Hrusecky: GSoC 2011 Ideas “ Karma plugin for openSUSE Connect](http://michal.hrusecky.net/2011/03/gsoc-2011-ideas-karma-plugin-for-opensuse-connect/)

This post is about one idea for GSoC 2011 regarding openSUSE Connect. I already [wrote about
        it](http://michal.hrusecky.net/2010/08/ideas-about-karma-in-opensuse-connect/) some time ago, but now is time to elaborate a little bit more.

First of all, let me state, that I already found a qualified student, that wants to work
      on this idea and that has also some good suggestions. So I™m not searching for a student with
      this post, but I want to share with you the goals of this project and why I think it is
      important.

Let™s start again with what it is all about. We as a openSUSE Project have many
      contributors. People provide not only code, but they write documentation on our wiki, report
      bugs, organize release parties, organize booths at conferences and much more. Obviously we
      should make their effort recognized by public. Usual way how to do it is to assign so called
      karma points. Basically concept works like that for every contribution you receive some
      points. And then, anytime you appear somewhere, everybody can see how skilled you are. This
      works well on forums, but we have many different people and many different kinds of
      activities. And we want project wide karma somehow.

So basic idea of this project is to create different kinds of karma and collect as many
      information as possible automatically. So we will have wiki karma that will grow with every
      wiki page edit. We will have marketing karma growing bigger with every tweet and blog post.
      Packager karma getting bigger with every change submitted to the openSUSE. So this project
      will be not only about displaying and managing karma points but also about collecting
      statistics from various different services.

One thing that I wanted implemented was ability for group moderators to reward group
      members for extraordinary work a little bit extra. So for example if some KDE developer will
      fix really tough bug, KDE people can give him some extra points. But allocating these extra
      points will not be easy and will definitely need some more thoughts. Main trouble will be how
      to allocate points that group can redistribute.

Other feature I wanted to have was having means how individuals can reward others whose
      work they appreciate. My original idea was to let people send around their own Karma points.
      But I was pointed out, that this might not be a good idea. There are few reasons why. First
      trouble is that people will get karma points of different type than they should have.
      Ambassador will send some karma points to the great developer and shy developer could earn
      many marketing points this way even though he prefers to be locked down in the basement. Other
      problem is that people that didn™t contributed yet or thanked a lot might not have anything
      left to show how did they liked the work. So other idea proposed by Kartik was using some
      general thanks you button. While thinking about it, it makes some sense to create separate
      karma type for that as well.

And what to do with karma point once you have some? It should be certainly displayed in
      the river on the connect so others will know that you did something. But there should be
      possibility to also use them somehow. Obviously there need to be a banner displaying amount of
      them that you can put on your web. So your visitors can see how great contributor you are.
      Other thing that I was thinking about was to create some badges for your avatars that you can
      buy. Or even allow third party applications to use them somehow using API, so you could buy
      things, but that sounds like a distant future¦

So there is a lot of work to do and student who applied has even some more ideas, so I
      think if this project will get selected, openSUSE Connect will be much more fun ![](http://michal.hrusecky.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif)

        of clicks you can create an openSUSE/SUSE based system and deploy to your hard drive, an usb

Suppose you want to create a tailored SUSE Studio appliance to run a Ruby on Rails app,
        this is a list of things you have to take care of:

  * install all the gems required by the app (this can be a long list).

  * install and configure the database used by the app.

  * install and configure a webserver.

  * ensure all the required services are started at boot time.

You can save some time by cloning [this](http://susegallery.com/a/CZ0T0D/rails-in-a-box) appliance shared on

            really makes me think we should go this way.

Ray's comment starting with "Every flicker and mode change in the boot

"Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn't
            going to go away. The code itself isn't well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It's only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don't have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

            [Equivalent of nvidia-settings for Nouveau](https://features.opensuse.org/312137)
          

"The open source driver for Nvidia GPU, Nouveau, is more and more performant. It is already fully usable instead of the proprietary driver.
However, there is no GUI to configure display. SaX2 module is not available anymore in YaST in openSUSE 11.4, and there is no way to make modifications such as defining the dpi.



Developping an equivalent of nvidia-settings for Nouveau would push even more users to switch to open source drivers."






            [weak conflicts/softlocks/no-recommends for patterns](https://features.opensuse.org/312150)
          

"Installation of a pattern also draws in packages that are not in the pattern but only recommended by those listed in the pattern. For the "minimal" pattern this behavior is not desirable though as one really wants a minimal installation without the optional stuff.
Current workaround is to add conflicts to the unwanted, recommended packages. That has the disadvantage that explicitly installing such blocked packages requires deinstallation of the pattern.



Therefore we need some mechanism to block recommended packages. I see several approaches:


1. introduce a weak-conflicts/soft-locks tag in patterns. This tag must be stronger than the recommends tag of packages.


2. add a no-recommends tag to the pattern which would cause the resolver to not honor recommends while installing the pattern


3. add a workaround to yast and hardcode setting the no-recommends flag when the user selects the minimal pattern."






            [make KDE's "kickoff" launcher menu recognizable in "Add widgets"](https://features.opensuse.org/312151)
          

"Nearly once a month, one of our users somehow manages to vanish his application launcher menu (aka kickoff), angry asking "Where's my green start button gone?!".


Even if he then manages to get to his panel options and find the "Add widgets" function, he'll never discover "my greenish chameleon symbol" there. He's usually completely lost at identifying the entry "Application Launcher Menu" as his missing widget, because that only bears that standard, feebly blue/white "K gear" symbol.


Even if he then manages to remember his missing bit was named like "kick" and types "kick" or "kickoff" in the search field of the "Add widgets" window - he'll find nothing... Why is that?


So I'd like to suggest:


- change the symbol of "Application Launcher Menu"
in the "Add widgets" list to the green "SUSEgreeter"
symbol everybody recognizes at once


- give this entry the keyword "kickoff" so that searching
for "kick*" would reveal exactly this entry


Since I'm a systems administrator and not a developer, PLEASE upstream this to KDE4 if it'd be rather their responsibility."






            [Kpackagekit: Patches by default, other updates optional](https://features.opensuse.org/312174)
          

"Since 11.4, the official updater in KDE is now kpackagekit and not kupdateapplet anymore. It gives you by default the notification of patches but also the packages on all the repos enabled.
For a power user it's a nice feature but for a basic user or a user that wants to have choice in softwares but just wants the system to work, it's anoying. Even with few additional repos, it'll give you a huge amount of updates. (...)"






            [Run certain steps in wizard and Install together](https://features.opensuse.org/312186)
          

"About two months I tried LinuxMint and installed in VirtualBox. When you install it, it asks you the bare minimum installation questions like partitioning and license agreement then starts installing. It saves time because you set up things like User as you install. If we could have YaST ask you about the license agreement, then Partitioning, Boot Loader and Software then as the installation runs (as in installing RPMs and formatting partitions) you set up Users, Hardware, read the Release Notes (that part is already done) and the Root password. It would save time and be more efficient."

I™m happy to announce LibreOffice 3.3.2 bugfix release for openSUSE. The packages are
          available in the Build Service [LibreOffice:Stable](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/LibreOffice:/Stable/) project. They fix various crashers, usability and
          translation problems, see the [libreoffice-3.3.2.2 release news](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/build/plain/NEWS?id=libreoffice-3.3.2.2) for more details. See also some notes about
            [openSUSE LibreOffice build](http://en.opensuse.org/LibreOffice).

The openSUSE LO team hopes that you will be happy with this release. Though, any
          software contains bugs and we kindly ask you to [report bugs](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Bugreport_LO). It will help us
          to fix them in the future releases.

**Other information and plans:**

The 3.3.2 packages includes KDE3 support again. Thanks Lubos Lunak
          who fixed all known issues and Ilya Chernykh who helped
          with packaging.

The 3.3.2 release is in a very good shape, so we
          decided to slow down the bug fixes release cycle. You might expect the 3.3.3 bug fix release two months from now.

LO-3.4 feature freeze is pretty close and we will
          start producing test packages in the [LibreOffice:Unstable](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/LibreOffice:/Unstable/) project. Please, be patient because there are many
          interesting changes in the build framework. They are good for the future but I expect some
          problems with packaging. I hope that I will manage to provide something by the end of
          April.

The Testing Core Team held an IRC meeting on March 28, 2011 at 17:00 UTC. We discussed
          our plans for the next "Open Bugs Day", which will be from 00:00 to 23:59 UTC, Saturday
          April 2, 2011. As written before, the emphasis will be on identifying those bugs reported
          for 11.2 and older that are still present in 11.4. We will not attempt to squash these
          bugs, but to make sure that none have been forgotten. After the release of 11.5 M5, we
          will have a bug-squashing day. 

As I write this, OBD has started. I'm not sure when this will be published, but if it
          is still April 2, then please join us at irc://irc.opensuse.org/openSUSE-testing.

**Torvalds said that he considers 2.6.39 more of a solid version with

        new and improved drivers, the new kernel, which is expected to be released in late May or

Fifteen days after [releasing Linux 2.6.38](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/What-s-new-in-Linux-2-6-38-1205467.html), Linus Torvalds has closed the merge window of Linux 2.6.39,

      end of his release email, Torvalds said But on the whole I
          think this should be one of those 'solid, boring progress' releases.;
      however, his enthusiasm about the auto-grouping of processes and the VFS optimisations in
      2.6.38 had been unusually strong.

If you are a fun of Aljazeera News channel, this is a nice command that allow you to
        watch Al Jazeera live in your Linux desktop. I tested the command and is working like a
        charm.

![](http://cdn.unixmen.com/images/stories/thumbnails/images-stories-videos-aljazeera1-400x225.png)

First check if you have rtmpdump installed, if not install it using the command
        :

sudo apt-get install rtmpdump

Now to start watching Aljazeera live, open terminal and enter the following
        command

**To use Mplayer
        :**

**$ rtmpdump -v -r rtmp://livestfslivefs.fplive.net/livestfslive-live/ -y \\
"aljazeera_en_veryhigh" -a "aljazeeraflashlive-live" -o -| mplayer -**

**To use VLC
        player:**

$** rtmpdump -v -r rtmp://livestfslivefs.fplive.net/livestfslive-live/ \\
-y "aljazeera_en_veryhigh" -a "aljazeeraflashlive-live" -o -| vlc -**
          

Enjoy :)

**Editors Note:** For openSUSE you should install via:
          zypper in rtmpdump instead of sudo apt-get

### For Developers and Programmers




        [Dominique Leuenberger: how to fix brp and rpmlint warnings “ today:I: Program causes undefined operation(likely same variable used twice and post/pre incremented in the same expression)](http://dominique.leuenberger.net/blog/?p=178)
      

It seems the planned series sort of finds an audience, which in turn of course is
        motivational to keep on writing it. Today, we™ll have a look at this Informational message
        in BRP
        checks:

I: Program causes undefined operation
 (likely same variable used twice and post/pre incremented in the same expression).
 e.g. x = x++; Split it in two operations.

This is currently informational only and is not failing the build, but you might want to
        address them together with upstream. 

I assume you do know what a++ means in C (otherwise, you should start reading
        C-books), so we just try to reproduce this error in a simple c test
        case:

#include <stdio.h>
 
int main() {
 int i=5;
 i = i++ * ++i;
 printf("The current value of i is %d", i);
 return 0;
 }

When building this using gcc -Wall test.c, we get this compiler warning (which in turn
        is what brp translates to the information we™re discussing
        here)

> gcc -Wall test2.c
 test.c: In function ˜main™:
 test.c:5:5: warning: operation on ˜i™ may be undefined

So, let™s first see for ourselves what we would expect this to be? Hmm.. already for us,
        this looks not logic (and I surely hope nobody would write this code). Let™s just see what
        starting this executable gives shall we?

The current value of i is 37

Now, is this surprising? We multiplied, assigned it to i and as a result we get a prime
        number? By closely analyzing the line you will likely understand what the compiler did. But
        was this expected? If this is actually what the programmer intended, the code should just be
        rewritten to be more logical, like:

i = (i+1) ^2 + 1;

This is understandable for all of us and does not yield the surprise of what is going
        on.

And that is actually all this warning is about: it requests the programmer to write code
        that can be understood and does not depend on what the compiler interprets. It might even
        very well be that the different optimization levels or the usage of different compilers
        might end up in different results.

If you want to read some more about this topic, I suggest to have a look at:

  * [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_point)

        [Serverwatch/Juliet Kemp: Use Linux and WebDAV to Facilitate Online Collaboration](http://www.serverwatch.com/tutorials/article.php/3929346/article.htm)
      

The WebDAV protocol enables users to store and share files via HTTP. This is
        particularly valuable in cases where HTTP is usually read-only, as WebDAV allows writing as
        well. In addition to accessing documents, users can (with suitable permissions) edit and
        re-upload them. Think of it as a networked file-system run over HTTP; or as a way of
        supporting long-distance collaboration on files. The protocol supports locking and
        versioning information, so once you've accessed the WebDAV folder, you can edit files
        without risking overwriting other people's edits. These days, there are more and more ways
        available to undertake online collaboration, but WebDAV remains a useful and straightforward
        way to share files, especially as it's supported by plenty of software at both server and
        client end. (...)

This is a detailed description about how to set up an OpenSUSE 11.4 server (x86_64) that offers all services needed by ISPs and hosters: Apache web server (SSL-capable), Postfix mail server with SMTP-AUTH and TLS, BIND DNS server, Proftpd FTP server, MySQL server, Dovecot POP3/IMAP, Quota, Firewall, etc. In the end you should have a system that works reliably, and if you like you can install the free webhosting control panel ISPConfig 2 (i.e., ISPConfig runs on it out of the box).



I will use the following software:

    


        

  * Web Server: Apache 2.2.17 with PHP 5.3.5, Ruby, and Python 

  * Database Server: MySQL 5.1.53

  * Mail Server: Postfix 

  * DNS Server: BIND9 

  * FTP Server: proftpd 

  * POP3/IMAP: I will use Maildir format and therefore install
              Courier-POP3/Courier-IMAP. 

  * Webalizer for web site statistics 


      

Please note that this setup does not work for ISPConfig 3! It is valid for ISPConfig 2 only! (...)

[Kohei Yoshida: mdds 0.5.2
        released](http://kohei.us/2011/03/28/mdds-0-5-2-released/)

I™m happy to announce that version 0.5.2 of [Multi-Dimensional Data Structure
        (mdds)](http://code.google.com/p/multidimalgorithm/) is available for download from the link below.

[http://multidimalgorithm.googlecode.com/files/mdds_0.5.2.tar.bz2](http://multidimalgorithm.googlecode.com/files/mdds_0.5.2.tar.bz2)

This is a bug fix release. I would like to thank David Tardon for fixing several important
      bugs as well as implementing some new API™s for flat_segment_tree. In fact, the majority of
      changes between 0.5.1 and 0.5.2 are from David.

Here is the run-down of the major changes since 0.5.1:

  * flat_segment_tree

    * fixed a crash on assignment by properly implementing assignment operator().
                

    * fixed several bugs in shift_right():

    * shifting of all existing nodes was not handled properly. 

    * leaf nodes were not properly linked under certain conditions.

    * shifting with skip node option was not properly skipping the node at insertion
                  position when the insertion position was at the leftmost node. 

    * implemented min_key(), max_key(), default_value(), clear() and swap().

    * fixed a bug in operator==() where two different containers were incorrectly
                  evaluated to be equal. 

    * added quickcheck test code.

There is no API-incompatible changes since 0.5.1, so if you are currently using mdds
            0.5.1, your code should compile with 0.5.2 without any modifications.

[Introducing
        snapper: A tool for managing btrfs snapshots](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/04/01/introducing-snapper/)

Today we want to present the current development of snapper, a tool for managing btrfs
      snapshots.

For years we had the request to provide rollbacks for YaST and zypper but things never got
      far due to various technical problems. With the rise of btrfs snapshots we finally saw the
      possibility for a usable solution. The basic idea is to create a snapshot before and after
      running YaST or zypper, compare the two snapshots and finally provide a tool to revert the
      differences between the two snapshots. That was the birth of snapper. Soon the idea was
      extended to create hourly snapshots as a backup system against general user mistakes.

The tool is now in a state where you can play with it. On the other hand there is still
      room and time for modifications and new features.

### Announcements



[Opensociety:
          ODF 1.2 approved as Committee Specification](http://www.opendocsociety.org/news/odf-tc-approves-odf-1.2)

The OASIS Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) TC has officially
        and unanimously [approved](http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/office/201103/msg00089.html)
        ODF 1.2 as a Committee Specification. The new version of the standard has taken four years
        to complete and has been adopted by many applications already. Next stage is the official
        vote within OASIS to adopt this specification as an OASIS standard. OASIS is the designated
        maintenance body for ISO/IEC JTC1 SC34 IS26300.

ODF describes an XML-based application-independent and platform-independent digital
        document file format, as well as the characteristics of software applications which read,
        write and process such documents. The ODF standard is applicable to document authoring,
        editing, viewing, exchange and archiving, including text documents, spreadsheets,
        presentation graphics, drawings, charts and similar documents commonly used by personal
        productivity software applications. A significant number of governments worldwide have
        chosen ODF as the standard for exchanging documents within government and with external
        contacts such citizens and companies.

OpenDoc Society congratulates the members of the ODF TC on their work. This is an
          important step for the entire ecosystem, states Michiel Leenaars, board member of
        OpenDoc Society, There is significant demand for this new version of the standard, as
          it enables new exiting and unique features such as RDF metadata, advanced digital
          signatures and enhances key areas of ODF such as formula's. That means the next stage of
          interoperability for office applications is finally there. With already very
        strong vendor support for the new version of the standard and the formal adoption as an
        OASIS standard likely to occur in a matter of several weeks (i.e. a 30 day ballot period),
        OpenDoc Society encourages customers to evaluate and start planning the adoption of ODF
        1.2.

[Computerworld/Katherine Noyes: 10 ways that Linux is making life better](http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9215252/10_ways_that_Linux_is_making_life_better)

Linux has long played a leading role [in the world of servers](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/204423/five_reasons_linux_beats_windows_for_servers.html), due in large part to its stability, security and lower
        total cost of ownership (TCO). What many don't realize, however, is just how ubiquitous it's
        becoming in other parts of life as well.

Not only are distributions like [Ubuntu](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/221517/work_begins_on_ubuntu_1110_oneiric_ocelot.html) helping Linux make great strides [on the desktop](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/208111/reports_of_linuxs_desktop_death_are_premature.html), but the open-source operating system is now quietly powering
        myriad innovations that many of us take for granted.

Where can Linux be found today? Let's count just a few of the many places it's making
        life better. (...)

### Call for participation



[Mario Fux: We need you for Nepomuk
          (integration)!](http://blogs.fsfe.org/mario/?p=130)

First I™d like to thank David Vignoni for his work on the logo for the Randa meeting.
        It™s the basis for the work of the [young
          informatic trainees](http://blogs.fsfe.org/mario/?p=121). But the results are still secret (as even I haven™t seen
        anything myself but get the first results at the end of this week ![](http://blogs.fsfe.org/mario/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif) .

And now to the ideas and proposals (btw this has nothing in common with the [GSoC ideas of KDE](http://community.kde.org/GSoC/2011/Ideas)!). As you
        probably or hopefully already know the [KDE Nepomuk
          team](http://nepomuk.kde.org) will have a meeting in [Randa](http://community.kde.org/Sprints/Randa) this June (from the 1st to the 7th of this month) and we still want
        application developers to integrate this technology in their application or to work on some
        interesting and great new ideas. And there will be really good help as [Sebastian TrÃ½g](http://trueg.wordpress.com/) will be in Randa and he is going
        to do one or the other workshop of Nepomuk basics. And here are some ideas and thoughts of
        mine to start your imagination engines:

  * The KDE semantic clipboard. There is [some
              code](http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/playground/base/nepomuk-kde/semclip/) in the old subversion playground of KDE and in December 2010 I wrote a
              [paper](http://blogs.fsfe.org/mario/thesis_template.pdf) about this
            topic. In short, this clipboard enhances to normal one with the capability of knowing
            what (in the context of meaning) it copy-and-pastes. This clipboard does not just copy
            numbers and formatting but addresses, geographic coordinates or blbliographic
            references. Take a look and bring it to a releasable state. There are even some solution
            proposals in the above mentioned paper.

  * All of the new [KDE PIM](http://community.kde.org/KDE_PIM)
            application use Nepomuk technology through their [Akonadi](http://community.kde.org/KDE_PIM/Akonadi) interactions.

  * [Digikam](http://www.digikam.org) had (or has?) some capabilities
            to exchange its information and metadata with the Nepomuk storage. What about tagging
            your pictures with the contacts (and [PIMO::Persons](http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/pimo/)) of the
            new Kaddressbook and projects which are then usable system wide.

  * And [Amarok](http://amarok.kde.org) had (or again has?) some
            functions to share it™s music database with Nepomuk and thus make it system wide and not
            just enclosed in one applicatition.

  * But there are as well good examples for existing Nepomuk integration: [Bangarang](http://bangarangkde.wordpress.com/). A multimedia player which
            remembers what you like, what music and videos you have on your system and where is more
            information about this media data (in the web).

  * Another idea could be a (scientific) paper or article collector which understands
            the connections (or quotations) between the articles and that the strings at the top
            (authors) are actually persons and the references at the end of the articles are
            actually links and thus relations to other papers and articles. Take a look at the
              [SWRC ontology](http://ontoware.org/swrc/).

  * Yet another project which extensively uses Nepomuk is the new [KDE Telepathy
              framework](http://community.kde.org/Real-Time_Communication_and_Collaboration). They don™t just invent yet another represenation of a person and
            its contacts but use PIMO::Person and thus make connections to them system wide
            comprehensible and reusable.

  * And let™s not forget the [Plasma framework](http://plasma.kde.org)
            and its [activities](http://userbase.kde.org/Plasma#Activities). But
            there is more and better information about this on the [site of ivan Cukic](http://ivan.fomentgroup.org/blog/).

  * Or something completely new. An ontology for TV series, recordings and shows¦
            (Update: Sebastian told me that there is already one: [NMM](http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/oscaf/ticket/44). And Bangarang and
            some other applications use it.)

  * And there is [Zeitgeist](http://zeitgeist-project.com/) and [QtZeitgeist](http://releases.zeitgeist-project.com/qzeitgeist/)¦
            (...)

[Frederik Schwarzer: German subforum on forum.kde.org opens its gates](http://looksblo.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/german-subforum-on-forum-kde-org-opens-its-gates/)

A few minutes ago, a subforum was created on [forum.kde.org](http://forum.kde.org/) for all the German-speaking users out there (and yes, developers
        are users as well :)). So please come and make yourself at home, so it will grow and become
        the best and nicest German-speaking place to get help for those little itches KDE users
        sometimes have to scratch.

On your mouse, get ready, [Go!](http://forum.kde.org/viewforum.php?f=204)

[h-online: Linux distributions to include /run/ directory](http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Linux-distributions-to-include-run-directory-1219006.html)

On the Fedora project's developer list, systemd developer Lennart Poettering has [announced](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.redhat.fedora.devel/146976) the
        introduction of a /run directory in the root directory and provided detailed background
        explanations. Similar to the existing /var/run/ directory, the new directory is designed to
        allow applications to store the data they require in order to operate. This includes process
        IDs, socket information, lock files and other data which is required at run-time but can't
        be stored in /tmp/ because programs such as tmpwatch could potentially delete it from there. 

However, /var/run/ isn't a readily available choice for tools such as systemd, udev or
        mdadm that are required early in the boot process, because /var can be implemented as a
        separate file system to be mounted at a later stage in the start-up process. As a result,
        these programs have had to resort to such trickery as using the /dev/.udev, /dev/.mdadm,
        /dev/.systemd or /dev/.mount directories, even though the device directory isn't intended
        for such data. (...)

[FOSDEM 2011: LibreOffice Online Help (Wikihelp)](http://artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~kendy/blog/archives/monthly/2011-03.html#2011-03-31T11_35_21.htm)

I realized I did not post my FOSDEM slides online; this blog post is to fix that ;-) So
        if you want to learn more about our approach to the on-line help, please have a look here: 

[LibreOffice Online Help (Wikihelp)](http://artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/%7Ekendy/blog/pics/LibreOffice-wikihelp-FOSDEM2011.odp)

It talks briefly about what we have done to bring the [LibreOffice help](http://help.libreoffice.org) online, and about the future
        steps. Talking of the future steps, in 3.4, the .xhp files are still the source of the help
        (check the presentation if you want to know what are the .xhp files), because we did not
        manage to do the 2nd step - converting the wiki markup back to the native help files. 

Actually - I would like to mentor a GSoC task for that: 

[Convert LibreOffice Help to Platform Specific Help Files](http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Gsoc/Ideas#Convert_the_LibreOffice_web_help_.28wikihelp.29_to_platform_specific_help_files)

If you are a student interested in Free Software, with free summer, and Python or Perl
        knowledge (to bind to existing MediaWiki markup parsers), this might be a nice task for
        you!

### Reviews and Essays



[Linux.com/Nathan Willis: Weekend Project: Create a Paperless Linux Office](http://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/426566:weekend-project-create-a-paperless-linux-office)

The paperless office: whether to combat clutter or save the forests, it has been the
        dream of many a computer user ever since the first electronic record of, well, probably
        anything. But it remains elusive, in no small part because whatever your personal
        intentions, you just cannot control the actions of other people, and many businesses today
        still insist on sending you printed bills and receipts. You can at least dispense with the
        filing cabinets, however, by scanning in the documents you need as searchable, full-text
        PDFs. Fire up the scanner and the weekend.

Clearly, you could just scan everything and save your documents as TIFF or JPEG files.
        Linux has solid support for USB desktop scanners (even all-in-one printer/fax/scan devices
        and those with sheet-feeders or other attachments) thanks to the [SANE](http://www.sane-project.org/) project. There is also no shortage of
        quality scan applications, like [Kooka](http://kooka.kde.org/), [XSane](http://www.xsane.org/), or [Simple Scan](https://launchpad.net/simple-scan). But with images alone you
        lose the ability to search the text content of your documents ” and remember, you can not
        only search within a particular document, but use GNU utilities to search your entire
        document collection. (...)

        [Jeff Hoogland: Dialog with the Girlfriend](http://jeffhoogland.blogspot.com/2011/03/dialog-with-girlfriend.html)
      

About a year ago I [made a post](http://jeffhoogland.blogspot.com/2010/03/minting-girlfriend.html) about installing Linux on my girlfriend's laptop. Just recently I was [quoted on Linux Insider](http://www.linuxinsider.com/rsstory/72103.html) about how successful the installation had been a year later. I said that I believed it to have been a successful conversion of a Windows user to Linux. My descriptions were from my observations only, not my girlfriend's. I had not thought at that time to ask my girlfriend what she thought about the change of operating system on her computer.
        
      

Last night I sat down with her and we talked a bit about what she thought of her penguin powered laptop. With her permission I am going to post some of her responses. (...)
