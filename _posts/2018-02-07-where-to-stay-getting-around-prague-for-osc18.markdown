![](//www.planetware.com/photos-large/CZ/prague-castle-overlooking-the-city-0.jpg)Prague is a beautiful city and you can bet that the city will be crowded during the [openSUSE Conference](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC18). Hotels are already starting to fill up, so it’s best to take a look at the hotels we recommend now before all the hotels are booked out.

There are six hotels that are recommended, but feel free to book at other hotels in the city. The section for [recommended lodging](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC18) on the [openSUSE Conference 2018](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC18) webpage gives options for hotels as low as 40 EUR a night to above 120 EUR. Each listing on the section gives a little info about the hotel.

Prague is a big city with excellent public transportation. With the exception of one hotel listed on the web page, which is the [Vienna House Diplomat Prague](https://www.viennahouse.com/en.html), all other hotels are a few kilometers from the event location at the [Faculty of Information Technologies of Czech Technical University in Prague](https://www.cvut.cz/en/faculty-of-information-technology).

Getting to the event with public transportation is inexpensive. A one-way ticket, which is good for 30 minutes, costs about 1 EUR. People can use the [transportation map](//spojeni.dpp.cz/ConnForm.aspx?tt=PID&cl=E5) to figure out how to take public transportation from the hotel to the event. The [transportation map](//spojeni.dpp.cz/ConnForm.aspx?tt=PID&cl=E5) offers an interactive map to help with planning.

<!-- more -->There are [a couple buses](//www.dpp.cz/en/daytime-operation/) from the airport to metro stations (subway) that will take you to downtown Prague. Bus line 100 and 119 will take you from Letiště (Prague Airport) to Nádraží Veleslavín (metro A) or Zličín (metro B). The event is located near the Dejvická station, which is two statons from Nádraží Veleslavín. The cost for the bus is about 32 CZK, which is about 1.20 EUR.

Using the Google app on a smartphone will allow you can navigate Prague fairly easy, but if you want an app that gives you more option during your outings at oSC18, try one of the five recommended apps listed in this [article](https://prague.tv/en/s72/Directory/c218-Technology/n2285-smartphone-apps-prague).

There are many sights to see in Prague and if you have never been there, we recommend visiting the [Charles Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bridge), [Prague Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_Castle), [Old Town Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Town_Square) and [St. Vitus Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Vitus_Cathedral).

We look forward to seeing you at oSC18 and, if you haven’t [submitted at talk](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC18/program/proposal/new), please consider doing so before April 20.
