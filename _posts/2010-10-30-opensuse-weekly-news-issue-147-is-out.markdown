####  [Thanks for your participation at the openSUSE Conference](//news.opensuse.org/2010/10/25/thanks-for-your-participation-at-the-opensuse-conference/)




"A lot of people have been involved with the openSUSE Conference and I’ve heard a lot of people saying thanks for a great conference. This is supported by 290 attendees visiting our conference, listened to a number of talks, enjoyed a high quality program and even more important met people face to face and had a lot of fun. The conference as it took place last week wouldn’t have been possible without our community participating, sending in good talks and a number of folks preparing everything. Of the latter ones let me point out some:

Giving a strong statement to it’s moto, the openSUSE Conference received ambassadors from the Fedora Project and Debian Project as well as people from Mandriva/Mageia, Slackware, Skolelinux and many other distributions. Moreover, many downstream projects presented their work, seeking cooperation with the openSUSE community. (...)"

"We recently added automagic recognition and start-up of several more window managers such as windowmaker and fvwm2 into Studio, but XFCE4 is still missing from the list. One reason for this is that it simply doesn't work out of the box without a few tweaks. This is easy to do in Studio and in this post I'll explain step-by-step how to build an openSUSE 11.3 appliance with XFCE4. If you are already familiar with building appliances in Studio, just skip to the summary section at the end for the list of steps. (...)"

####  [Klaas Freitag: A new Flavor: openSUSE Invis Server](//lizards.opensuse.org/2010/10/28/a-new-flavor-opensuse-invis-server/)




"Beside many other amazing things which happened at the openSUSE Conference 2010, Stefan Schäfer gave a talk about his project called Invis Server. It is a very specific server solution for the small and medium business, based on the openSUSE distribution. The Invis Server is perfect software for all production installations in small business use cases, also to be maintained by consultants in that space.  

  

 All needed services such as printing, mail, web and file server, database and groupware are there and get preconfigured at installation. For daily operation in the users network, there is a simple yet powerful web interface.  

  

 In the discussion after the presentation it turned out that Stefan would be fine with moving the Invis Server Project nearer to the openSUSE project and get a larger community find together to power up the project on openSUSE distributions."

####  [Lluis Sanchez: NGit](//foodformonkeys.blogspot.com/2010/10/ngit.html)




"One of the features we want to include in the next MonoDevelop release is integrated support of Git. I committed a first version of a git add-in some months ago which works by invoking the git command and parsing the results. This solution satisfied some basic needs (Mono was moving to git at that time), but it was done as a short term solution, since parsing git output is not very reliable, and has portability issues.  

  

 The next obvious step was to use GitSharp, a fully managed .NET library which implements most of git commands. This library is basically a port of JGit, a Java library for doing the same. I started replacing the git invocations by calls to GitSharp classes, and I could implement the basic functionality, but I found some limitations that were not easy to overcome. On one hand, GitSharp was a bit outdated, lacking some of the recent features and bug fixes done in JGit. Bringing GitSharp up to date with JGit would be a lot of work, since every JGit commit had to be manually translated from Java to C#. On the other hand, GitSharp depends on a set of cryptographic libraries (required for the ssh protocol support) which we can't easily include in MonoDevelop due to export regulations. (...)"

"Sorry for the horrible english in title :D Can't find the right way to say it. My point is, that currently Zypper shows only the progress of current package download. Wouldn't it be nice if we'd also see the overall download progress? I have a few other people who also asked that, so I thought it'd be a good idea to suggest." 




####  [#310747: radiotray in an opensuse repository](https://features.opensuse.org/310747)




"Radio Tray is an online radio streaming player that runs on a Linux system tray. Its goal is to have the minimum interface possible, making it very straightforward to use. Radio Tray is not a full featured music player, there are plenty of excellent music players already. However, there was a need for a simple application with minimal interface just to listen to online radios. And that's the sole purpose of Radio Tray.  

 Radio Tray is Free Software, licensed under the GPL.

####  [#310752: I need to know what I am missing](https://features.opensuse.org/310752)




"When one does an upgrade install (or even an overlay install), it would be Really Useful to use the output of $(rpm --query --all) on the previous installation in order to select packages for the next installation. Clearly you cannot guarantee getting them all and there are so many reasons why. Stillandall, various packages that I use all the time are on the repos but not installed until I trip over them and fire up Yast to go fix the issue. So, my suggestion is this: 




  1. make a better effort to install packages from the repo (e.g. guile-devel, gperf-devel, etc.) 


  2. where you cannot do it, leave behind information about the omitted packages in some well-named file (e.g. /var/log/missing-packages.txt) so I can tell straight away what I still have to install. This way, I don't have to go stub a toe to find out." 




####  [#310758: Multitouch input layer from X.Org Server 1.10 for opensuse 11.4](https://features.opensuse.org/310758)




"A request for the multi-touch support to be included in opensuse 11.4 via Multi-Pointer-X, due to be rolled into X.org Server 1.10 in mid February 2011. (...)" 




####  [#310762: Enhanced package dependency solver database](https://features.opensuse.org/310762)




"We suggest to have a web based sat-solver engine providing dependency resolution from a well known API server, e.g. solve.opensuse-community.org   

  

 This service should have solve files for as many repositories as possible from many different build services or other package providers. The service is similar to the existing webpin service, but should be powered by a much faster engine, and should provide an API usable by YAST, zypper and friends. (...)" 




####  [#310764: Install with YaST as user](https://features.opensuse.org/310764)




"For centrally managed systems it would be really cool to be able to install programs locally using the package manager. Currently it's possible to install programs as a normal user but only using the terminal and with several disadvantages - one major one is that you're stuck with basically a static snapshot of the systemwide installations from the point you begin installing on. If it were possible to use YaST to install programs as a user while still being connected to the systemwide RPM databank it would be a lot more user friendly and effective." 




####  [#310765: include PiTiVi - video editor](https://features.opensuse.org/310765)

 However, there’s always more to be had and videos are a great way to share the atmosphere of a conference.

####  [Thomas Biege: Secure Development Workshop at Nuremberg](//thetoms-random-thoughts.blogspot.com/2010/10/secure-development-workshop-at.html)




"My last working week was really busy and started at Sunday noon because I was in Nuremberg to hold a web-security workshop for my colleagues at Monday morning. Traveling at Sunday feels a bit strange, no business people, but much party people with hangovers. OOo Impress hung X completely by eating up all available resources. Nevertheless the live sessions worked better than expected and seem to be the salt in the stale slide soup.  

  

 The "it-sa Sicherheitsmesse" (security trade show), OWASP conference, and the openSUSE conference were the overlapping highlights of this week. Unfortunately I missed the OWASP conference... :(  

  

 This week is the last chance to do web-application penetration-testing of in-house products before I have to take over the incidents handling next Tuesday.  

  

 I still need to find a good way to bring threat modeling and secure development to Web 2.0 without using bloated text documents and reusing text blocks all the time." 




####  [Nelson Marques: openSUSE Conference – Aftermath](//nmarques.digitalwhores.net/2010/10/27/opensuse-conference-aftermath/)




"I arrived to Nuremberg on thursday evening. The first person I’ve identified after arriving into the Hotel was Sirko, commonly referred as ‘gnokii’. Luckily I’ve managed to get the last ride to Lizards Lounge. Stupid me… I didn’t knew that the Lizard’s Lounge was a bar, neither that openSUSE had it own beer… and it tasted cool, even for a Portuguese who doesn’t consume beer besides Kasteel.  

  

 On the Lizard’s Lounge, it was awesome, even without knowing anyone, people were friendly and this was also where I got my very own first shock! The problem for me that day was that I had left Portugal very early and arrived in Germany very late… I was without sleeping for that night and very tired… eventually ended up by going back to the Hotel. Sirko’s directions were awesome and I’ve made my back safe.  

  

 Friday was awesome! I’ve met Nuno Pinheiro from oxygen, a fellow Portuguese and made much more friendships. I also found out I was considered a ‘controversial’ person… Well… now that some of you know me and have contacted with me, maybe I’m not such a monster… anyway, I’m still very vertical and sometimes pop a conflictive speech. I apologize, it’s a language thing… being thinking in Portuguese and translating on real time, it’s sometimes a pain, specially with native english speakers. (...)" 




####  [Jos Poortvliet: Catching up](//nowwhatthe.blogspot.com/2010/10/catching-up.html)




"Currently catching up to things after the openSUSE conference. It was awesome but I had over 1000 unread mails, hundreds of planet posts to look at - luckily I have managed to catch up to sleep ;-)  

  

 I just released the Conference impression article on news.openSUSE.org - read it if you want a little taste of the conference. Personally, I can say it has added a second highlight to the conference year for me. I go to lots of things like LinuxTag, FOSDEM and many developer sprints. However, the yearly Akademy meeting has always been a lone wolf for me - in that it is so much better than anything else there is nothing comparable. Now there is. The atmosphere and energy of the openSUSE conference, while different, is certainly on the same level and I've heard the same from several other (KDE and GNOME and even other distribution) people. I already look forward to the next openSUSE conference - like I look forward to the next Desktop Summit... (...)"

"As I promised in my blogposts about openSUSE Conference before, I publish my slides from the first evening with the movies and of course I give the URLs to the movies. First the slides its svg and so you can use your browser to see them. (...)" 




####  [Jos Poortvliet: oSC successful? Absolutely!](//nowwhatthe.blogspot.com/2010/10/osc-successful-absolutely.html)




"Just a quick note: I'm very proud of the very successful openSUSE conference and wanted to spread that word ;-)  

  

 Seriously, the "collaboration across borders" theme has worked out incredibly well. We even have a Red Hat developer with his own Build Service Project now. And I heard whispers about Mageia pondering the use of OBS as well. Awesome!  

  

 I know, I know, we didn't fork any big projects - well, actually, we had the first LibreOffice conference tracks there - it's becoming a real open source project, finally. Getting rid of pesky code attribution stuff has taken down a huge barrier. (meanwhile OpenOffice keeps crashing on my laptop. Which is OK, I used KPresenter for my presentation - too bad Beta 2 introduced the audience to ODF tags in the slides hehe) (...)"

####  [Michael Schloh von Bennewitz: House party report](//lists.opensuse.org/archive/opensuse-ambassadors/2010-10/msg00081.html)




"This relates to applying the lessons learned from last week's conference. 


Event: Generic house party  Date: 24 October 2010  Location: Munich 


(...)  

 ...I was the only software engineer. 




There was no formal presentation, because this was a nontechnical party. However, I did tell the story of Konrad ZUSE and a few things about networks, business, home computing, and how OpenSUSE fits in.  

  

 I was able to generate interest in OpenSUSE by deemphasizing the fact that the DVDs can be installed, and by emphasizing that they can be used in a nondestructive manner. My suggestion was:  

 'Keep the DVD in view next to the computer, and use it from time to time when you suspect that your installed operating system is not performing correctly.'  

  

 If you'd like to know why I chose this strategy, please ask." 




####  [Chuck Payne: We are Geeko ( Second Calling)](//lists.opensuse.org/archive/opensuse-ambassadors/2010-10/msg00090.html)




"Lights, Camera, Action!  

  

 Hello. This is the second call to all openSUSE Ambassadors. We are working on a video to add to the wiki and to show that we are golbal community.  

  

 We did one already that was shown at OSC10, but we didn't get a lot of people as you can see.

  * As I wrote before, I believe that Java has rather weak patent protection, not being particularly innovative or novel really - rather a collection of existing techniques packed together into one (useful) package. With a load of design artefacts in the API that can be claimed as in some sense 'novel' though of little intrinsic technical merit. I wrote a long screed on the background to this: Why Oracle's Java Copyrights Might Matter in August. As I also wrote before: I am not a Lawyer, and have no very deep understanding of the Java situation. (...)"

"Network providers face a never-ending battle to keep up with demand from users for bandwidth while at the same time increasing the speed of their overall networks. One of the major limiting factors is that many networks still rely on copper wire rather than the superior fiber optic cabling. The networks therefore have to choose when to make the very expensive upgrade to fiber optic, and where those upgrades should happen first.  

  

 Thanks to some new technological breakthroughs, however, copper wire may be making a comeback. Current download speeds offered to end users range from 2Mbps-50Mbps, but we are all looking towards 100Mbps as the next milestone. While you may think fiber optic would be required for that, Nokia Siemens Networks has managed to employ phantom circuits to boost data-carrying capacity over copper wire to as much as 825Mbps over short distances of around 400 meters.

 KDevelop 4.1 can now publish changes using email, pastebin or ReviewBoard and features the addition of native support for the Git distributed version control system – version 4.0 already included SVN and CVS integration. The current release also includes various new plug-ins that allow users to, for example, run arbitrary shell commands or external tools directly from inside the IDE via the external scripts plug-in. Other changes include support for PHP 5.3, Hex Editor updates and a function that allows users to import remote projects and start working on them directly. (...)"
