Next years [FOSDEM](http://www.fosdem.org/2011/) takes place again in Brussels on Feb 5th and 6th 2011 and openSUSE will be present as usual!

Apart of the well known high level open Source tech conference there will be for the 2nd time the Distribution [Miniconf](http://www.fosdem.org/2011/distrominiconf). The Miniconf provides the perfect place for different projects to share ideas, talk about challenges each project has and to foster collaboration - and as openSUSE is all about collaboration we want to play a major role there.
<!-- more -->
The Miniconf is open for every project. For more information please subscribe on the Miniconf [mailinglist](http://lists.fosdem.org/mailman/listinfo/dist2011). We are looking for talks about cross-distro collaboration and presentations on openSUSE technology - like OBS, openFATE but also where we are going - things like Tumbleweed!

Our contact with FOSDEM is [Henne Vogelsang](http://en.opensuse.org/User:Hennevogel), if you think about giving a talk, contact him.
