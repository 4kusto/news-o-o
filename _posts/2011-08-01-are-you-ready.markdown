Less than 50 days left before the [3rd openSUSE conference](http://conference.opensuse.org) starts. A lot of people are working hard for this to be another successful gathering. Are you [registered](http://conference.opensuse.org/indico//confRegistrationFormDisplay.py/display?confId=2) yet? If you are still undecided, and looking for a reason why you should come, let me tell you this:

<!-- more -->



	
  * You will miss many interesting 	talks, you've heard the little birds sing that kernel star Greg KH will keynote at oSC...

	
  * ![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2208/5786476411_ca7dd8ef82.jpg)More awesome keynote speakers and sessions are going to be announced in the next week or so, STAY TUNED!

	
  * You will miss one of the greatest 	FOSS events in the world.

	
  * You will miss a chance to meet 	other fellow Lizards from all over the world in person.

	
  * You will miss the chance to meet people from other projects like [KDE](http://www.kde.org/), 	[GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/) and [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/).

	
  * Imagine the interesting talks you 	will have in the halls of the conference, if you won't come you will 	miss those too.

	
  * You will miss to visit Nuremberg, one of the most beautiful and historical cities on Europe.

	
  * You will miss tons of group-hugs.

	
  * You will lose the chance to kick 	people that annoy you on IRC and on Mailing lists.

	
  * You will miss the chance of 	drinking lots of openSUSE Old Toad Beers and eating tons of Wurst having a good 	excuse, you will be in Germany after all so it's your 'duty' to do 	that. ![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2287/5787032792_0cf1fb32fb.jpg)


If you want to come, but money is a problem then you can apply for assistance through the [Conference travel sponsorship program](../2011/07/23/travel-sponsorship-program/). People of openSUSE are willing to help you, as much as possible.

The conference will take place in [Zentrifuge](http://www.zentrifuge-nuernberg.de/) which is a very interesting place to be. [Zentrifuge](http://www.zentrifuge-nuernberg.de/) has an exhibition and event hall on the former grounds of a company called AEG. The hall is used to host art exhibitions of local and international artists and workshops. It is managed by a foundation that helps network the art world. The people there are very excited about the idea of hosting our conference so you can count on having a great time there during the conference.

Oliver Fecher visited Zentrifuge Venue and took a few shoots of the place that will host the Conference. Take a closer look at the photos and imagine you and your favorite FOSS people having endless talks there.
