####  [openSUSE Connect hacking session at FrOSCon 2010](https://news.opensuse.org/2010/08/09/opensuse-connect-hacking-session-at-froscon-2010/)


"HackMeck is the weekend hack retreat of the openSUSE Boosters team in the openSUSE development room @ FrosCON. The aim of HackMeck is to advance Connect, the social networking framework the project is using to connect its users with each other. This is a great opportunity for new contributors to participate together with experienced members on some specific objective.  Connect is built on top of the Elgg plattform and most of the features we want are already available as Elgg plugins. We will evaluate and enhance those in order to match our expectations. However, some additional features will also require the creation of new plugins. Connect runs on a combination of a web server and the MySQL database and is written in the PHP scripting language. If you already posses knowledge about this very popular web server environment we encourage you to join HackMeck! But even if you don™t there are plenty of cool things to do and this weekend will give you the opportunity to learn and further yourself."  


####  [New German Language Forums](http://forums.opensuse.org/english/news/announcements/444040-new-german-language-forums.html)


"Discussions were held. Feasibility tested. The result is we now have our own German language forums together with 11 new German language forum moderators. I would personally like to welcome erikro, caerdu, pistazienfresser, Kaiserhg, Fruchtratte, Lehmama, HRGargi, Esvau008, lOtz1009, johest, and Linuxsusefan as our newest forum staff working in the German language forums. Also buckesfeld deserves a pat on the back for putting in all the work needed to make this happen."

"Now that [Mono has moved to GitHub](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Jul-22.html), a number of contributors (including myself) have been somewhat lost, not knowing how to properly use Git. So today, I'm recommending a book to help all the lost souls out there get comfortable with using Git.  As many long-time programmers probably know, O'Reilly books are top notch. Most probably also would not be surprised that O'Reilly has a book covering Git: Version Control with Git: Powerful Tools and Techniques for Collaborative Software Development."

One of the nice things this year is we have submissions from other distributions and projects, which is great :-) The submissions from all parties cover a wide variety of topics from very technical to very fun, and it isn™t going to be easy to select which ones to accept."

"Well, finally and happily I was able to make my LaunchParty for 11.3 here in my city. It was a simple setup: The place with the help of a local FOSS Academy that let me use his installations, Some media that I burn to giveaway, one of my laptops and my sister laptop to place two machines for desktop demonstrations, and just the desire to speak the word of the Geeko :D ¦"

"Yesterday, we had the Launch Party for 11.3 here in Chemnitz. It was interesting, how we do it we do it wron. For the last Launch Party we rented a room in a near cultural center, after that we thaught we can do it in the conference rooms of my company. And this time it was filled up :D We had a lot of guests. Some of them came really early and so it was time for an coffee and smalltalk. This time we prepared 3 talks, I started with the openSUSE A-Z contribution guide after that Tobias Koenig followed with KDE yesterday - today and tomorrow, that was a really intersting presentation. He talked about how KDE started and he showed how KDE looked in earlier versions and on the end how showed some things what comes in future. Michl send me some books and I gived them away for the first questions (in Tobias case it was a nasty question about backuping akonadi). The last talk was a special topic, we had Kai-Uwe he talked about his Oyranos project, thats a server for color managment."

"Over the past week so many great new updates were committed to the Factory, I just had to write about it. The openSUSE Factory the staging ground for the next release of openSUSE, but fortunately most app updates make their way into repositories for openSUSE 11.3 such as GNOME:Apps/openSUSE_11.3. Adding these repos in YaST can be an awesome way to get the absolute latest app updates for your openSUSE install, the downside of these bleeding edge repos however, is that the packages have undergone less rigorous testing than a formal openSUSE release. All disclaimers aside, onto the new fancy stuff!"

"Today, while toying around with the system settings menu in KDE 4.5, I noticed an option to enable the good old Ctrl+Alt+Backspace combo. It™s been a while since I™ve used that combination thanks to the stability KDE offers these days and, it wasn™t until I discovered it in the settings that I remembered using it a few years back. The combo, which allowed killing the X server is now disabled by default in many major Linux distributions."

It offers a convenient graphical interface in which you can design labels with the same tools you are used to finding in image editing software, but it also supports business-friendly advanced features like mail merge and barcode generation. In addition to that, its focus on label creation offers some advantages in printing over general office or graphics alternatives, like simple control over printing partial sheets."

"My last post on QML had a lot of people asking for an example, as opposed to a general discourse. In my opinion, if you want concrete examples you need to move from blogs into real code. Given that I have written a, hopefully simple, application demonstrating the points in my last post (designing C++ code for QML use), this post (writing games with QML), and the next QML post I plan to write (QML™s versioning system, when I™ll use version 2 of this example). It™s a C++ module containing word-game related logic designed for use from QML, plus a QML game using it, and they can be found in the qt-qml-demo-playground repository in the wordgame and longwords folders, respectively. They are merely intended to provide some concrete examples, and you don™t have to play with them before reading the rest of this post (but it is a game, so you can :) ). Now onto the topic of this post, writing games with QML."

"So, continuing with my last post about things to do after an openSUSE installation, now its the time for Adding Games, but first, some clarifications about two things:  One: You can add Codecs and other stuff with a 1-click-package, avoiding to use Zypper, I just expose the zypper method because I think its a bit more short :-P , but that its just matter of taste. So, if you are running openSUSE 11.3 with KDE use this ymp, and if you are using GNOME use this other. If you are on a older version of openSUSE, just go to this page and select your version.  Two: The broadcom-wl package its on Packman, so you have to add that repo (Via YaST -> Repositories), before you can install that package."

Several tools exist to do this in Linux, but there are a number of potential pitfalls and restrictions that can make the task more difficult than it might at first seem. This article guides you through the task of resizing Linux partitions, beginning with basic preparations and moving on to common resizing scenarios using graphical user interface (GUI) tools."

"Whether you are a frequent latex user, and especially if you are just starting off with it, you must have encountered situations where compiling the document correctly gets downright painful. Or found it just irritating to google every time or look up a cheat-sheet [pdf] to insert a not-so-common symbol. Or you know about the excellent application kile but as a GNOME/LXDE/Xfce user you did not want a zillion kde libraries installed.  I have started maintaining three packages, namely Texmaker, TeXworks and Rubber, in the Publishing repository. These applications make working with and compiling latex documents user-friendly and painless."

"So of course, while I™m spending a glorious and relaxing week hanging out in Boulder, Colorado, the KDE community is working overtime fixing a few showstopper bugs. Version 4.5 of the KDE Software Collection (also known as KDE SC) was released Tuesday, a week late from the original release plan, but it looks like a pretty good one.  Tyler Ballance over at OMG! SUSE! has a good overall summary of the highlights of this release. I got my Kubuntu laptop upgraded with only a little fussing with APT repositories (semi-inevitable on launch day). After just a day of playing around, I™m pretty happy."

This iteration of the desktop environment includes updates to the developer platform, KDE's applications and the core desktop experience, all contributing to a very important release for the KDE community.  Due to release schedules not quite aligning the way you might hope, you're not likely going to see KDE 4.5 debut on openSUSE any time soon, with 11.4 being scheduled for March of next year. In the meantime, what's a little KDE eye candy between friends?"

###  Reviews and Essays





####  [Linux Journal/Susan Linton: Spotlight on Linux: openSUSE 11.3](http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/spotlight-linux-opensuse-113)


"openSUSE began its life in 1994 in Germany as SuSE Linux and was based on Slackware Linux. It was a commercial offering, and although it adhered to the letter of the GPL, it wasn't easy for desktop users to download and install. Novell bought SuSE in 2004 and opened it up for community participation and enjoyment in August 2005. From then on, users could download and easily install the now-dubbed openSUSE. openSUSE earned lots of attention and happy users until its controversial patent agreement with Microsoft, but openSUSE slowly has been regaining some lost ground ever since."

####  [openSUSE 11.3 Review](http://www.thinkdigit.com/Features/openSUSE-113-Review_5223.html)


"openSUSE is one of those few Linux distributions that gives you a choice of desktop environment while you are installing it, and doesn™t treat KDE or Gnome as a primary option. Both environments have equal support from openSUSE and are equally customized. Until a previous version (openSUSE 11.1) the installation would not even have a default desktop environment selected, and you would need to select one of KDE or Gnome before installing. Even now all that has changed is that the option of KDE comes selected by default, to ease the choice for new users. Besides Gnome and KDE, the openSUSE DVD version even offers XFCE, LXDE as an option along with a minimal X Windows environment, or text-mode for servers; all on the same DVD."  


####  [ESecurityplanet/Keith Vance: Linux Security, Then and Now](http://www.esecurityplanet.com/article.php/3898261/Linux-Security-Then-and-Now.htm)


"Linux is inherently not a secure operating system. The reason it's not secure is because Linux was based on the architectural design of UNIX, and the creators of UNIX didn't care about security “ it was 1969 after all.  "The first fact to face is that UNIX was not developed with security, in any realistic sense, in mind; this fact alone guarantees a vast number of holes," Dennis Ritchie wrote in his paper, "On the Security of UNIX" in 1979."
