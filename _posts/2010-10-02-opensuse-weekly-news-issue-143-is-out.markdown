####  [openSUSE: Target Aquired](https://news.opensuse.org/2010/09/27/opensuse-target-aquired/)


"Over the last week you have all given input on the new strategy document describing the target users of openSUSE. It saw quite a bit of rewriting and rephrasing but it seems the description fitted most of your perceptions. We have incorporated all the comments into the document and a new iteration can be found on co-ment.  Furthermore, the next piece of text has been added: What does openSUSE offer its users? Like with Target Users, we would really appreciate it if you could give your input on co-ment but we will accept any kind of input on any channel we can follow. So if co-ment isn™t your thing, feel free to comment below this post, on the forums or anywhere else. For those new to co-ment “ it is a pretty awesome commenting tool under the GNU Affero GPL.  Giving your input on co-ment will make the discussion a bit more structured and easier for everyone to follow. How-to: select some text you want to comment on (a word, a few words, a sentence) and choose the little yellow + sign on the top-left of the page to add your comment. If you click a colored section of the text, you can see the comments which have been made to that section it and add your own voice to the discussion. Easy peasy!  You can find the document here. And for reference here the openSUSE Strategy portal on the wiki. Please have fun!"

"Everyone familiar with SUSE Linux will definitely know or at least have heard about YaST (Yet another Setup Tool). It is one of the many unique features SUSE has over other Linux distributions and makes the otherwise tricky system configuration a snap. These configurations include hardware, network, services, security, and many more.  YaST has evolved over the years to include many different front-ends, such as those for GNOME, KDE, and text consoles (ncurses). The most recent addition is a web-based front-end called WebYaST. It simplifies remote system administration and configuration - you don't have to SSH into the system anymore, all you need is a web browser.  It is now easy to include WebYaST in your Studio appliances. Simply go to the appliance editor and select the Enable WebYaST option under the additional options section of the configuration tab (for SLE11 SP1, openSUSE 11.3 only):"

"After some unexpected last-minute action, GNOME 2.32 is out! It's a smaller release than usual, as we started this cycle with 3.0 as a target and decided to change the plans during GUADEC. So some modules just have bug fixes, with their cool new features incubating for 3.0. Still, there are some neat changes in there: for instance, metacontacts in Empathy will certainly make people happy, and the SyncTeX support in Evince is just amazing! With the inclusion of Rygel and gnome-color-manager, we also move GNOME closer to the perfect desktop ;-)"

"kde-obs-generator no longer depends on KDE, so the name doesn't really describe this tool well. So we are looking for a new name! Few ideas suggested so far are obs-generator and Packager-O-Matic. But we know that our community can be really creative - we got the name for our chameleon in Prague ZOO from our community - so we are asking for your help again. Please propose some names for this great tool in this questionare. And if you are going to openSUSE Conference or you know somebody going there and your proposal will be selected, then you can win plush Geeko! For more details read whole post face-wink.png "

####  [#310621: Get rid of %suse_update_desktop_files](https://features.opensuse.org/310621)


"In less than a month we will have the openSUSE Conference 2010 with the motto "Collaboration across Borders". So I think it's a good time to fix this.  The openSUSE Build Service is a great tool, and with mostly just some "Substitutes" you can have a single spec file, mostly without %if's, that will build in any RPM-based distro. Now in my experience one of the most problematic things is the %suse_update_desktop_files macro. That forces to add ugly "%if 0%{?suse_version}" to every package with a .desktop file. (...)" 


####  [#310622: Run xserver without root privileges](https://features.opensuse.org/310622)


"Now that we have KMS enabled in the distribution we are a step closer of being able to run the xserver with just user privileges, and thus making openSUSE more secure. About a year ago I read a blog post of a moblin developer stating that achieving this is not that hard, but I've yet to see another distro achieving it. Nevertheless I think we can start to think about it." 


####  [#310623: Please bring SCPM back to Suse](https://features.opensuse.org/310623)


"SCPM is one of the major components (among others) for why I prefer to use Suse over other distros. I use SCPM for changing many configuration values for hardware and software cleanly, through one tool, instead of dozens, between when plugged into very different docking stations between work and home, when at home undocked, when roaming at coffee shops, when locked down for work or client sites, when broadcasting live shows at various locations, or when setting up different hardware profiles with different components connected and keeping the configuration consistent for that profile, printers, firewall rules, etc. (...)" 


####  [#310643: Easier System Configuration with KDE](https://features.opensuse.org/310643)


"I'm not sure if this needs to be brought up on this forum, on a KDE project forum, or both. I find display monitor configuration navigation to be confusing and difficult in openSUSE 11.3 with KDE. I also find the inability to configure my Logitech mouse behavior (double-click speed etc.) to be a significant problem for some users. I have found openSUSE with Gnome to be much better in the area of mouse configuration." 


####  [#310646: Kernel 2.6.37 for opensuse 11.4](https://features.opensuse.org/310646)


"I realise we are using a time based release, and no longer chase feature releases, but 2.6.37 will have some very interesting technologies according to phoronix:  [http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=ODYyMw](http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=ODYyMw) (...)" 


####  [#310649: Adjust kernel choice automatically for server-based-install](https://features.opensuse.org/310649)


"As described [here](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=613216) and discussed also [here](https://features.opensuse.org/309257) Selecting the kernel-desktop during a minimal-server-install lead to more works for admin.  Can we just adjust the pattern, to select the kernel-default if 64bits install, or the kernel-pae if 32 bits." 


####  [#310652: Have an Etherpad install on openSUSE infrastructure](https://features.opensuse.org/310652)


"Currently the marketing team in particular makes use of lots of piratepad's to work collaboratively on articles, announcements, plans and other things. Wiki's don't offer the ease and real-time collaboration features needed so piratepad is perfect. Except that it isn't. Piratepad has some serious issues (see "Why do we want this?"). So we would like to have an Etherpad install on openSUSE infrastructure. (...)" 


####  [#310658: bypass "partitioning" option for pre-partitioned installation targets](https://features.opensuse.org/310658)


"Mandriva provides installation cmdline option that I always use: readonly=1 This causes normal partitioning steps to be bypassed. No creatiion, deletion, or modification of existing partitions is possible. Instead is presented a list of Linux native partitions for mountpoint selection, mount options selection, whether to format, and format to use. This is handy for both advanced users like myself, and for frequently repeated installs, such as development milestones. It can save significant time initializing an installation, and it can avoid some opportunities for mistakes in one of the more dangerous and difficult installation phases. It would be excellent for openSUSE to have a similar installation option." 


####  [#310659: specify whether bootloader is to be master bootloader for whole system](https://features.opensuse.org/310659)


"Most of my systems are multiboot. As a consequence, some bootloader has already been installed. I should be able to specify that the new openSUSE bootloader being installed will only be used for the new openSUSE system and not any of those previously installed. This would keep the new openSUSE bootloader's menu much simpler, and prevent the need for the installer to hunt for stanzas to add to menu.lst, as well as saving me the often considerable time required to manually remove those unwanted stanzas. Furthermore, I would have NOT be preselected in any case that the new / or /boot is not on the first BIOS disk, and when the new / or /boot is a logical partition." 


####  [#310661: better facility to search for bugs](https://features.opensuse.org/310661)


"openSUSE has really no bad bug support. However non-Suse users can never enfruit the benefits of openSUSE`s qa because there is no good way to search for bugs. This is even a problem for anyone who wants to check whether a problem is already reported before reporting it himself.  I believe openSUSE could gain a lot of users by a better bug search. Bug reports do often contain solutions to common problems. If bugs are findable they will become linked and will thus be found more often by Google instead of the standard Ubuntu-threads talking around the hot pap."

It's still quite beta because I was not able to test it the way I should have but I think that if you are interested in that topic, it's worth a look already.  Let's start immediately and create an AutoYaST image with the UI."

####  [Nelson Marques: Marketing @ openSUSE Conference, Across Borders!](http://nmarques.digitalwhores.net/2010/09/25/marketing-opensuse-conference-across-borders/)


"I™ll be conducting a small talk at openSUSE Conference 2010 in Nuremberg in the next 23rd October. My goal isn™t about teaching or lecturing anything, but instead make people more sensible to marketing activities and how it could be used more effectively within free software projects.  I™ve called it The Concept of Marketing and FOSS Communities. That™s where it starts for anyone who jumped in into Marketing. Historically, Marketing started being debated by the Academy around 150 years ago and some have very serious criticism about Marketing as a science¦ In fact Marketing is made of pieces from another sciences like Anthropology, Psychology, Management, etc. I skip this fight, it™s irrelevant. Historically, no one needed marketing when ˜offer < demand™ was verified, but when it changed to the opposite ˜offer > demand™, people started to look into Marketing. So far this hasn™t much to do with FOSS reality, though it might have for the future and being aware of this is always a good point, despite of the FOSS philosophy promoting a different set of values from those who are typically associated with ˜sales™." 


####  [Nelson Marques: my talk slides for openSUSE conference¦](http://nmarques.digitalwhores.net/2010/09/29/my-talk-slides-for-opensuse-conference/)


"I™ve made available my talk slides for openSUSE conference on my fedorapeople user space for anyone interested. It™s a small 15 slide presentation about the Concept of Marketing and a possible approach to FOSS communities." 


####  [openSUSE Ambassadors rocking around the world!](https://news.opensuse.org/2010/09/29/opensuse-ambassadors-rocking-around-the-world/)


"Last week our Ambassadors did what they do every week: promote openSUSE. They went to meetings, conferences and tradeshows for a talk or staffing a booth. And they organized meetings, gave students lessons in using openSUSE, handed out DVD™s and valuable knowledge.  Many visitors of this site have no idea how active our ambassadors really are. The amount of work they do is amazing and they deserve a bit more of a spotlight on what they do! Their reports are usually highlighted in our weekly news, be sure to check their work out each week.  Read on for a short selection of reports which came in over the last week by the openSUSE ambassadors. And note that we get reports like this almost every day! Some come in the form of text, others like this one by Bruno about attending FrOSCamp 2010 in Zürich are in the form of a nice presentation (very much worth a look)."

"At the tail-end of my last post regarding Amarok 2.3.2 I mentioned that the package was currently the "KDE:Unstable:Playground repo" with a disclaimer about using the package from that repo.  As luck would have it, the turn-around was pretty short from the package appearing in the "unstable" repository to when it propagated to a more user-friendly repo like KDE:UpdatedApps."

So when the service is refreshed, the repositories belonging to this service are synced.  This is used for example for our enterprise customers, which are subscribed to the Novell Customer Center service, therefore they get automatically the repositories they are entitled to.  There are other potential use for services that I described in that blog post two years ago. However I want to present what we have been prototyping in the last days and what could be done with this."

Which was an interesting experience to some degree.  :-)  So.. I™m actually in Europe to work! Not play. And I™ll give dedicated posts to the two events I™ll be at this month, but quickly, I™m attending the GNOME-A11y hackfest/AEGIS Conference in Sevilla, Spain. This is a solid week of work. And later in October, I™ll be headed up to Germany for the openSUSE conference.  Kinda hard to call this work when you know you™ll be around friends you™ve made online and have met previously. But for today, I™d like to just take a moment to thank sponsors that are making these events accessible to me. Without them, I wouldn™t be able to enjoy the full benefits of the conferences and for that I™m deeply grateful."

If you look at the release notes you'll find a ton of new features and enhancements to existing features. For example, this release brings better error messages for unique constraints, improvements in PL languages for stored procedures, and a lot more.
