[![Prosciutto, anchovy and onion pizza.](//farm1.static.flickr.com/248/459381964_4d7141d15f_m.jpg)](//www.flickr.com/photos/giovannijl-s_photohut/459381964/)Yesterday's release of the first Leap Beta in the 42 series has people excited. Another thing that gets people excited is pizza, so why not combine the two for a Leap Betafest Pizza Party. That's right; there will be plenty of time before the official release, so why not test the beta and eat some pizza. Have a Betafest 42.1!


## Download the Beta...


The latest testing release is available at [software.opensuse.org](https://software.opensuse.org/developer/en?release=developer) in the development version.

This release is the final release before openSUSE goes into Release Candidate and need feedback. Please install it on a VM, [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org) or on your hardware. Report and help fix any problems you encounter.

## mmm Pizza...


Get the Pizza (and a place to eat this). Geeko in Nuremberg will have a party on Oct. 2 at 1300 UTC. Any Leap or Tumbleweed users in Nuremberg are welcome to attend by [signing up on the wiki page](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:BetaPizzaPartyNBGAttendees). If there's no party around, you can organize your own. Be sure to check [the wiki page!](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:BetaPizzaParty)


### Organize your own BetaPizza Release Party


If there's no Betafest in your area, organize your own! Pick a local pizza place or get some delivered to your home or office; invite friends and colleagues and [put your party on the wiki](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:BetaPizzaParty). A new openSUSE user may show up!

If you are unsure of how to do it, read [this](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Launch_party_HOWTO).


### Testing and even helping out!


The focus of Betafest is about building a local openSUSE community and testing Leap 42.1 Beta2. This means installing it and [submitting bug reports](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Submitting_bug_reports) when you bump into trouble. [Download it](//bit.ly/1iOyl2T) and put it on an USB stick or a DVD so people can get to work right away!

Bugs should be reported and can be tracked via [Bugzilla](//bugzilla.novell.com/). Find a [how-to on reporting bugs on the wiki](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Submitting_bug_reports).
Discussions about openSUSE development takes place on the [factory mailing list](//lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory). [openSUSE Factory](//en.opensuse.org/Portal:Factory) is the development release of openSUSE. If you want to help out, please see the wiki page on [contributing to Factory](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:How_to_contribute_to_Factory). Contributing is easy and very welcomed!

There is plenty of help available on the [Development page](//en.opensuse.org/Portal:Development) on the openSUSE wiki and you are more than welcome to ask for help on [the openSUSE factory mailing list](//lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory) or on [the openSUSE IRC channels](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Communication_channels#Instant_chat_.28IRC.29)!


## Have a lot of fun


Whatever bugs you find, remember Betafest is about having fun! It doesn't matter what technical knowledge you or the other visitors have - as long as you are having fun.
