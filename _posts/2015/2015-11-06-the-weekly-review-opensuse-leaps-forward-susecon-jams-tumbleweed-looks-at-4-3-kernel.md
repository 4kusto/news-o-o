While the work week comes to a close, the openSUSE project’s week continues into the weekend.

The project will have a booth at[ Open Rhein Ruhr](https://www.openrheinruhr.de/) in Oberhausen, Germany, and in two weeks openSUSE will join with SUSE at [Super Computing](//sc15.supercomputing.org/) 2015 in Austin, Texas.

[openSUSE Leap 42.1](https://news.opensuse.org/2015/11/04/opensuse-leap-42-1-becomes-first-hybrid-distribution/) was released this week at [SUSECon 2015](//www.susecon.com/), which was a blast. If you have not seen the video release at SUSECon called Uptime Funk, you have to listen to it. The hits on YouTube are going through the roof with this parody.

The reviews for openSUSE Leap 42.1 are looking good. While some media are comparing openSUSE Leap 42.1 to the recent release of Fedora 23 (Congratulations Fedora), openSUSE Leap 42.1 is targeting developers, sysadmins and users who want a more mature and stable Linux environment. Through the uses of libraries and other source packages shared with SUSE Linux Enterprise, openSUSE Leap 42.1 offers something entirely different than the newest open source packages because the openSUSE project has [Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed); Leap’s purpose is focused on giving users who gradually upgrade confidence in our new distribution. While the project is more than happy to gain new Linux users, Leap focuses is on the idea of system upgrades.

Tumbleweed is the project’s other distribution that provide the latest reliable and tested packages, so people who want the latest packages should look at using that rather than Leap. This week Tumbleweed released the [20151030 snapshot](//lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2015-11/msg00110.html).

Some of the newest packages upgraded in that snapshot were Mesa 11.0.4, GNOME 3.18.1, Linux Kernel 4.2.4, LibreOffice 5.0.3 with the GTK3 module split out and XOrg 1.17.4. Expect the Linux kernel to update to 4.3 soon in Tumbleweed.
Expect more news to be posted about Leap in the coming weeks. Details about Power 8 (ppc64le), and ARM (AArch64) in openSUSE Leap 42.1 should be available in the next few weeks as well as some other Leap related news.
