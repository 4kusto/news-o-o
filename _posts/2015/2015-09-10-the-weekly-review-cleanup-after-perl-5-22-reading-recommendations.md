[![Tumbleweed](/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Tumbleweed.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Tumbleweed.png)After an update to Perl 5.22 and adding Plasma 5.4, Tumbleweed had no snapshots this week but there is one expected within the next few days. 

The Perl update to 5.22 required a lot of cleanup and much of the resources and efforts for builds were focused on Leap this week.

Last week’s release of Leap’s Milestone 2 was well received and contributors have provided feedback about filling the gaps for items in Leap.

The next important dates for the [Leap roadmap](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Roadmap) are Sept. 20, which is the freeze date, and Sept. 24, which is scheduled to provide the Beta.

Other items that are trending within the openSUSE community are an [education program](https://news.opensuse.org/2015/09/08/opensuse-asia-summit-expands-with-study-area/) related to the [openSUSE.Asia Summit](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/summitasia15) and the implementation of the [openSUSE landing page](//cyntss.github.io/opensuse-landing-page/), which should be published soon, and an [openSUSE search page](//opensuse.github.io/searchPage/), which contributors can add new search engines to if they would like.

A topic we want to share in this weekly review is a reading list the SUSE Documentation team lead Markus Feilner put together about 10 books every Linux and Open Source newbie should know.

  1. Linus Torvalds, "Just for Fun"
