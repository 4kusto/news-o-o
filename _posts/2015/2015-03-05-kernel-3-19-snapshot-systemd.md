[![Tumbleweed](/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tumbleweed.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tumbleweed.png)[Distrowatch](//distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=suse) will be changing its color scheme for remarks on Tumbleweed from red to green. Snapshots for Tumbleweed have included [Kernel 3.19](https://www.kernel.org) as it was the first distro to update to Kernel 3.19 and the next snapshot will provide an update for [systemd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd).

Systemd 219 has some fixes in the works and is currently blocking the release of the new Tumbleweed snapshot. Additional contributions would help speed up the release and be highly appreciated.

While [GCC 5](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-5/changes.html) won’t be in the next few snapshots, progress is being made; the difficult fixes to GCC5 are the ones that remain.

As for the previous snapshot released earlier this week, [Mozilla](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/) Firefox was updated to version 36. There is a significant amount of additions to 36 and support for full HTTP/2 is enabling a faster, more scalable and responsive web. Mozilla also updated Thunderbird to 31.5.0 and MFSA 2015-24/CVE-2015-0822 provides reading of local files through manipulation of form autocomplete for both Firefox and Thunderbird.
