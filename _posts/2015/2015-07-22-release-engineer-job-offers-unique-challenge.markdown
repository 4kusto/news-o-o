[![t-shirt-motiv1](/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/t-shirt-motiv1.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/t-shirt-motiv1.png)A job announcement for a [Release Engineer for openSUSE](//bit.ly/1GBFIyp) was published today and it offers a unique challenge, which sounds pretty cool. The optional bonus challenges to be included in the candidates' application are:

1. Being a regular contributor to a community distribution? Point us to your work!

2. Using a programming language of your choice, write a small program that extracts all [CVE identifiers](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/identifiers/) from a given set of RPMs, and creates a sort index mapping CVEs to packages.

Bonus points if you can do it in 10 lines of [perl](https://en.opensuse.org/Perl). Extra bonus points if our perl experts scratch their head and ask "how does he do that?!" :)

3. Find out what changed in the minimal text installation between [13.2](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:13.2) and current [TW](https://en.opensuse.org/Tumbleweed) and try to find the reasoning behind the changes.

Providing answers to the challenge really give people applying for the position an opportunity to stand out among other candidates.

There are many smart people in the openSUSE Community and taking part in the openSUSE Project every day constantly reminds me of how many brilliant people I work with here in Germany and elsewhere.

If you are going to apply for this position, be sure to bring your "A Game" because to make our perl experts scratch their head is quite the challenge.
