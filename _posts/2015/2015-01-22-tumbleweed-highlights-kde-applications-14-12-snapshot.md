[![](https://en.opensuse.org/images/c/c1/Tumbleweed.png)](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed)The latest snapshot release of Tumbleweed has several updates. We dub this as the '[KDE Applications 14.12 snapshot](//bit.ly/1wpLlLo)' for Tumbleweed since many are related to 14.12.

Here are a few other updates:

Bison version updated to 3.0.2. This is a major update with deep overhaul improvements of the diagnostics.

IceWM added a fix for shutdown and reboot commands that didn't work and changed the shutdown and reboot command in preference.

AppStream-Glib, which makes it easy to read and write AppStream metadata, updated to version 0.3.2 adds more non-applications to the blacklist and added Blacklist KDE3 KCM components.

Britty updated to 5.2 and removes obsolete patches and adds a dependency to python3 for building.
