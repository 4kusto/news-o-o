#### [![42](/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/42.tif)](/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/42.tif)Roadmap questions answered[![42](/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/42.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/42.jpg)


Deep thought and some additional core SUSE Linux Enterprise source code have given The openSUSE Project a path forward for future releases.

The change is so phenomenal that the project is building a whole new release.

Some people might be perplexed over the next regular release, but rather than bikeshedding the name over the next few months, for the moment, we will call it openSUSE: 42 after its project name in the [Open Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org). And we are going to explain the [roadmap](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Timeline_openSUSE) for this regular release.

openSUSE 42 is scheduled to be released around [SUSECon](//www.susecon.com), which is in Amsterdam this year from Nov. 2 - 6.

Unlike old releases, future releases of “42” are expected to align with the releases of SLE service packs and major releases.

There are about 2,000 packages in openSUSE 42 right now, said Stephan “Coolo” Kulow, release manager. Of course, many more are expected.

openSUSE 42 will be a  long-term type release with enduring updates and maintenance commitments by the community and SUSE.

Kulow said a milestone will be released soon.

“We have to come up with solutions as problems arise,” Kulow said.

There is currently no plans for live CDs, but he said expect other media formats to be added later.
