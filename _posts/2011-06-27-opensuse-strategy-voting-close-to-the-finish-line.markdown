As we wrote [three weeks ago](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/06/07/time-to-vote-on-the-opensuse-strategy/), June 30th is the deadline for [voting for the openSUSE Strategy](http://bit.ly/kZaAC2)!


## Relevance


2 years ago the subject came up at the openSUSE conference: _what do we want_? That is not a simple question. We are a large community with wide-ranging diverse backgrounds, goals and interests.

**Having a coherent answer matters**: it shows potential new contributors what they can (although not limited) contribute to; it helps us make decisions. Do we focus on fancy web stuff? Do we go for a stable or more experimental product? Do we simplify at all costs or cater to more advanced users? These and more are questions brought up in our strategy discussion.

## Discussion


It took a long time - we are an open community and as such, strategic discussions take time. However, we went through the effort. Lots of input came from a variety of people - each iteration had sometimes over a hundred comments. You can view some of the [ although you should notice that co-ment is just one of the ways we collected feedback (others being the mailing lists, IRC, forums and more).](https://lite.co-ment.com/text/lNPCgzeGHdV/history/)

## [Serious](https://lite.co-ment.com/text/lNPCgzeGHdV/history/)


[While the ](https://lite.co-ment.com/text/lNPCgzeGHdV/history/)[current proposal](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Strategy) is not meant to be limiting new directions or will be forever set in  stone, it is meant to provide clarity to our community for the time being. So we do  want it to be taken seriously. We develop major software products promoting open source and the use of Linux world wide. We're a major Linux distribution, the  second largest by most metrics. We provide a packaging build service that is used by distributions more than just openSUSE.Â  We have an obligation to deliver a  consistent, quality product to our users. And to provide an open and fun  place to be around for contributors. We can't satisfy every need to the  fullest, but what we can do is make clear what we are trying to do  here.

Providing that clarity to our users and contributors through this strategy is a major step towards our future. So, we need our membership to vote. To make your voice heard and to know if it truly has the support it needs.
