"Robert and myself visited most open source projects attending LinuxTag 2 weeks ago and invited them to come to the openSUSE Conference “ be it as visitor, giving a presentation or doing a workshop. Feedback was all over the place positive. But feedback isn™t enough “ we™ll do some follow up to make some of them participate and all of us should now promote the openSUSE Conference where possible.  

  

 Let™s spread the word about the openSUSE Conference and its motto Collaboration across borders, invite developers of other communities and other projects to join as a visitor or to give a presentation on a topic which affects all of us or lets do a workshop, hack session or just having fun. Call for papers is open till July 31 “ so now is the time to shape the conference. Send in our proposal or idea to cfp@opensuse.org."

"The last days I fixed again some issues in osc. This time it was about the 'osc results' options: 




  * fixed 'osc results -a/-r' if you call it from a package directory 


  * fixed and enabled 'osc results -a/-r' also for project directories to be able to filter the output for architecture(s) and/or repo(s) (especially since it can be a long list) 



Since I have now commit rights at the osc git repo: it should be in the next release."

"Hi everyone! I worked on a few different things during the Novell/SUSE HackWeek. One of these things was continuing my Nautilus redesign that I (Garrett LeSage) started last year, continued with others (Allan Day, Hylke Bons, MáirÃ­n Duffy, etc.) at the London UX meeting and at LGM2010¦ and then further talked about on the Internet. During the HackWeek this month, I worked collaboratively with others (Allan, Hylke, Lapo Calamandrei, Andy Fitzsimon, and more) using Inkscape, Google Wave, Dropbox, IRC, and IM and we brainstormed on ways to improve Nautilus ” not just feature by feature, but how everything would work together."

####  [Sebastian Kügler (sebas): KMail™s Akonadi migration in openSUSE](http://vizzzion.org/blog/2010/06/kmails-akonadi-migration-in-opensuse/)




"In openSUSE™s KDE team, we™ve recently planned the migration to Akonadi, the groupware caching solution that will be the base of upcoming KDE PIM versions, notably KDE™s address book, email client and calendar app. With the release of KDE SC 4.4, we™ve seen the first component being ported to Akonadi, KAddressbook, spearheaded by its fearless maintainer Tobias König. In the KDE SC 4.5 cycle, we™re seeing more components in their first Akonadi-incarnation. As this means a big step for these applications, some attention needs to be paid to users who will, over the coming months, migrate to the Akonadi-based PIM components. The PIM team has decided to go with a stepped approach, and not introduce all applications in their Akonadi version at once. This is a sensible decision, as it allows you to learn from problems in the migration path, and fix these in the next wave of ports. PIM in SC 4.4 brought the address book migration, which wasn™t completely smooth from a user™s point of view. While in most cases, the fix was as easy as "point Akonadi to your contacts (or .vcf) file", we can (and will) do better with the migration of KMail. KMail2 (which is akonadi-based) will not arrive with 4.5.0, though, but is planned become part of the next monthly SC update, 4.5.1. This decision has been made by KDE™s PIM team in order to get a little more time to stabilise and test the release. This is also our first line of defense :-)" 





####  [Andreas Demmer (ademmer): Dashboard effect plugin: State of matter](http://feedproxy.google.com/%7Er/andreas-demmer/kde/%7E3/FiuWfEC_BtA/)




"Meanwhile, I have sent my patch of the dashboard effect plugin to the KDE review board. Aaron Seigo and Martin Gräßlin (both KDE core devs) have given me valuable remarks for enhancing my code. Additionally, they proposed changes in what my plugin should actually do: It should come with fancy animations, but skip the configuration options for brightness and contrast. The reason is, that users would most probably not understand why the optical configuration of a Plasma view cannot be done in the Plasma settings but window effect settings. I can fully agree to this." 





####  [Lubos Lunak (llunak): Details that sometimes do matter](http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/4252)




"Some things are really really tiny details, yet they can be annoying in way. Something that's been occassionally bugging me is that fact that KDE uses the same wallpaper as KDM background, the splashscreen background and desktop background, yet depending on the screen resolution it may not be exactly the same background - during login the picture may stretch or shrink at certain points. The times when decent monitor screens had a 4:3 ratio are a thing of the past, starting with LCD makers making 5:4 "narrow-screens", then changing their minds and making 16:10 or 16:9 wide-screens. The choice of screen resolutions is not that limited either and that means that the wallpaper has to be scaled ... and that was the problem. Plasma has code to select how to do the scaling, KSplashX has code for that and KDM has code for that, and yes, you guessed it, it's always a different code. So unlucky resolutions get different wallpapers from different code. Since I actually spent some time in the past trying to make the login as seamless as possible, this indeed made me twitch whenever I saw it."

"What is new in this release: 




  * Roughly API complete to SL4.0 beta. Next preview will be API compatible with SL 4.0 RTW. 


  * Video capture support, but support for pixel formats is sparse. right now the supported formats are YUYV and YV12/YUV420 (planar). 


  * SSE2 fast paths for gradient fills in the embedded pixman/cairo, this improves performance significantly as some people seem to have discovered the use of gradients. 


  * Fixes for chrome support and to our curl bridge. 


  * Several html bridge fixes. 


  * element to element binding. 


  * Client HTTP stack 


  * cascading (BasedOn) styles are now supported 


  * new right-click dialog so we can (finally!) managed isostore usage."

####  [#310004: use network manager by default instead of traditional method](https://features.opensuse.org/310004)




"Use network manager by default instead of traditional method. Network Manager integrates better with the desktop and seems easier to configure (for example, to configure a VPN)." 





####  [#310005: ask for root password once per-session](https://features.opensuse.org/310005)




"It would be nice to just ask for the root password once per-session. For security it would be valid only for the session for X minutes. When into the X minutes after the password is entered the request for authentication would just have the "Cancel" and "Continue" buttons, the password field would be hidden because the password would be still valid. When the X minutes expires, the system would as for the password again." 





####  [#310013: Disable strigi indexing by default](https://features.opensuse.org/310013)




"All over the web people are complaining about high disk and CPU load caused by it, and it is also said not to handle concurrent access to its databases correctly (e.g. simultaneous login on several machines with home on NFS)." 





####  [#310022: Improve one-click install experience in GNOME](https://features.opensuse.org/310022)




"Garrett did some great mockup that we should implement. See [http://linuxart.com/log/archives/2010/06/21/one-click-part-2/](http://linuxart.com/log/archives/2010/06/21/one-click-part-2/) " 





####  [#310023: have a "move to monitor" option on window list (gnome)](https://features.opensuse.org/310023)




"The panel window list has options to move the window between workspaces, but it does not have an option to move the window between monitors, when the user has two." 





####  [#310024: have a "primary monitor" option on gnome "monitor preferences"](https://features.opensuse.org/310024)




"Currently i am not able to set which is the primary monitor on gnome monitor preferences. I can set the position which is very nice, but i am not able to inform which one is the primary. The primary monitor is the monitor that the gnome panel appears, as well as any application when opened the first time." 





####  [#310025: Set Repository priority at install](https://features.opensuse.org/310025)




"With the settings as they are now, we have the main repositories all set at priority 99, new added repositories at 99 and one-click-install added repositories at 99. This, for sure will lead into troubles as users begin to use the package management and the vast number of repositories out there. When updating through "zypper dup", the system will always update to the latest version package out of all repositories, because all of them have the same priority. When installing new software, yast and zypper would always choose the latest package as well. This will break the system sooner or later with many repositories added and especially the meant to be easy to use one-click-install will speed that up, when users use them." 





####  [#310027: Dependencies should be installed when RPM is clicked.](https://features.opensuse.org/310027)




"EXAMPLE: I download Foo.rpm. I click on Foo.rpm. Foo.rpm depends on Foo_data.rpm. Foo_data.rpm is available in the repos, but is not installed. I have to manually install Foo_data.rpm, and then click on Foo.rpm. Clicking on an RPM package should call zypper to pull in dependencies and satisfy Foo.rpm. Debian already does this with gdebi." 





####  [#310029: Provide link to instructions for placing live CD on USB on main download page](https://features.opensuse.org/310029)




"The live CDs on [http://software.opensuse.org](http://software.opensuse.org/) reference the fact that they can be placed on a USB instead of a CD, but there does not appear to be a link to any instructions on how to do so. I think adding a link to something like [http://en.opensuse.org/Live_USB_stick](http://en.opensuse.org/Live_USB_stick) would be an excellent addition."

 The Team held its regular IRC meeting last Monday. Our schedule calls for a meeting on the Monday following an openSUSE release, thus we discussed our experiences with RC1. Each of the members attending the meeting had installed more than one instance of RC1. For example, I had done a "zypper dup" upgrade on both x86_64 and i386 architectures. In addition, I had done a new installation on another i386 system."

"One of problems with wiki, as knowledge base, is that someone has to hang on it and categorize submissions, old and new, but it is not one man, nor a layman show.  

  

**What is wiki**  

  

 The Mediawiki articles and file submissions are just linear list of titles. It is up to the people that use wiki to sort their knowledge there.  

  

 The tools that Mediawiki provides are search, few listings found in special pages, name spaces, categories, and of course ability to create articles that will link other articles and serve as indexes. (...)"

 SUSE Gallery allows you to easily share your appliances with the Studio community, in a fully searchable directory of appliances. All signed in Studio users can rate and comment on appliances, and each appliance can be downloaded ” or even cloned from, to start your own custom version of that appliance." 





####  [Garrett LeSage: One-click, part 2](http://linuxart.com/log/archives/2010/06/21/one-click-part-2/)




"You may remember when I originally redesigned the one-click installer for hackweek in 2008. Well, for this recent Novell/SUSE hackweek, I spent some time to slightly redesign and expanded on how the one-click installer should work. Will Stephenson also started working on an implementation, too." 





####  [Mario Carrion: Hackweek V: YaSTroid](http://blog.carrion.mx/2010/06/22/hackweek-v-yastroid/)




"Hackweek is an excellent opportunity to try something new. Hackweek V was not the exception. From June 7th to June 11th I joined a fantastic group of hackers to implement YaSTroid, our Android Front-end to WebYaST.  

  

 The week was fun. Learning new stuff, in this case Android, always helps me to see things different and somehow makes me appreciate other development platforms. Recalling Java was not that difficult. Honestly I thought Java had something new to offer to all developers, but it seems that Java hasn™t changed dramatically in years."

 There were many booths at the event, every major distribution like openSUSE, Gentoo, Ubuntu... had a booth were users could try the latest version and talk with the developers. (...)"

"I've been using my twitter to tweet about package updates recently (of course, it's all automated by a script that parses the spec file ;) -- hey, cmon, laziness is a feature :D).  

 A few packages I've created or updated recently that I would believe to be interesting: 




  * fireflies 2.07, a slick openGL screensaver: X11:Utilities 


  * rss-glx 0.9.1, a collection of nice openGL screensavers, also in X11:Utilities 


  * subversion 1.6.12, in devel:tools:scm:svn 


  * googsystray 1.2.0, notifications for google services/documents, in network:utilities 


  * handbrake-unstable packages, containing the latest upstream snapshot (even if unsupported by upstream) of the very powerful video ripper+transcoder, but still useful for testing and reporting issues (even though it ran smoothly for me), in the Packman repository 


  * fio 1.41, a versatile I/O benchmarking application, in benchmark 


  * key-mon, which seems interesting for presentations and demos, as it displays which keys are being pressed on the screen, in X11:Utilities 


  * transmission 2.0, a great feature-loaded but still simple to use bittorrent client with a daemon, a CLI client, a web interface, GTK2 and QT clients, both in the Packman repository as well as in the filesharing repository 


  * ftop, which monitors open files in a top-like manner, in server:monitoring (...)"

####  [Make Tech Easier/Joshua Price: Performing Image Magic with ImageMagick](http://maketecheasier.com/performing-image-magic-with-imagemagick-3/2010/06/24)




"Whether you know it or not, there™s a good chance you™ve already used ImageMagick, at least if you™re a Linux user. It™s the image processor behind many graphics-related applications, and for good reason. With this one tool, you can perform dozens of common image manipulations and conversions from the command line or within a script/application. ImageMagick can convert, transform, draw, decorate, animate, and composite images. It can be used from the command line for quick needs or built into a more complex software suite. This guide will cover some of the most magical features of ImageMagick and provide examples of how to use it to solve everyday tasks."

"For all you spreadsheet users: here's something kind of cool.  

  

 Let's say that you have a set of data. You have a list of items, and for every item that there is a unique item number, category number, and packaging type. (One row and three unique columns.)" 





####  [Worldlabel.com/Nathan Willis: Become a typeface pro with Fontmatrix](http://blog.worldlabel.com/2010/become-a-typeface-pro-with-fontmatrix.html)




"Casual computer users often give little thought to fonts, but once you starting working on design ” from your web site to your stationary needs, you soon begin to appreciate the positive effects a good typeface can have on branding and marketing. The trouble comes when you start to collect more fonts on your system than you can keep track of in your head. Worse yet, most operating systems attempt to manage fonts for you in an all-or-nothing fashion, through which large collections can slow down application speed, in addition to being tiresome to scroll through. The solution is a good font manager, like the open source Fontmatrix." 




  * You can install Fontmatrix packages for openSUSE via [1-Click Install](http://software.opensuse.org/search?p=1&baseproject=ALL&q=Fontmatrix).

"In the [MySQL Data Manipulation and Query Statements](http://www.databasejournal.com/features/mysql/article.php/3884346/article.html) article, we looked at two variations of the INSERT INTO statement. If you recall, we utilized the INSERT statement to populate tables, rather than the Data Manipulation Language (DML) SELECT...INTO command, which is unsupported in MySQL. However, MySQL does provide the INSERT...SELECT statement. This, and other variations of the INSERT statement will be the topic of today™s article."

 Robin Roblimo Miller reported this weekend that the future looked bad for pioneering free software repository freshmeat.net.  

  

 Geek.net, the parent company of SourceForge.net, Slashdot.org, ThinkGeek.com, Geek.com, freshmeat.net, and ohloh.net, has told employees that it will be closing freshmeat.net and ohloh.net.

I also wrote the Device Viewer in KInfoCenter and the new Summary Information page. The new Summary Information Page is what I would like to talk about. Hugo Pereira Da Costa has supplied two great patches to do with UI consistency, the first has been submitted but I would like KDE users opinion on the second. I like to get opinions before making large UI changes, so from the two images below, could you do me ( and KDE ) a favour and comment on which you prefer."

"Ah well, today marks a month since the official GSoC coding period started.  

  

 Brief intro: I™m working on implementing automatic tagging of faces for digiKam, with face detection and recognition. For that, I™ve been working on a library named libface that does the detection and training/recognition.  

  

 At some point, it was deemed necessary to make a Qt wrapper for libface, so that Qt/KDE programs could easily use it. This has been now (almost) done, and the resulting library is named libkface. libkface will be put somewhere in kdegraphics/libs as soon as the API freeze is over (I think), and will be usable not only by digiKam, but also by other programs like KPhotoAlbum." 





####  [Linux Weekly News/Jon Corbet: Python "newthreading" proof of concept released](http://lwn.net/Articles/393822/rss)




"The "newthreading" project within the Python community is a new attempt at improving concurrency in Python programs and facilitating the removal of the much-maligned global interpreter lock. A proof-of-concept implementation has just been released. "This pure Python implementation is usable, but does not improve performance. It's a proof of concept implementation so that programmers can try out synchronized classes and see what it's like to work within those restrictions." More information can be found on the newthreading page. "
