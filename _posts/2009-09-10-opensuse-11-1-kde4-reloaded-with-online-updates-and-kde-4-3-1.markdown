Although [openSUSE 11.2](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE_11.2) is still [two months away](http://en.opensuse.org/Roadmap) updated openSUSE 11.1 KDE4 Reloaded images previewing some changes are available now. They are [respins of openSUSE 11.1](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/KDE:/Medias/images/iso/) including KDE 4.3.1, Firefox 3.5 and all the online updates which have been released for openSUSE 11.1.

These installable Live-CDs are useful for people who want to test out KDE 4.3 and users who are doing new installs and want the most recent openSUSE updates straight out of the box, saving a lot of installation time. New in this version is that the images [can be also dumped to a USB stick](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2009/08/05/hybrid-live-systems/) and booted from there.

See the [KDE 4.3 announcement](http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.3/) for more information on the improvements and new features in KDE 4.3.

Compared to openSUSE 11.1 KDE4 desktop, the images include the latest KDE4 version of applications like Amarok, Digikam, KNetworkManager and the new Qt4-based YaST Control Center. Some additional applications like Choqok, Kompare, Marble and Okteta could be added thanks to a [more efficient compression algorithm](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2009/04/28/whats-behind-lzma-compressed-livecds/).



## A Note of Caution


Please note that this is not an "official" openSUSE release, and has not undergone the same kind of testing that stable releases receive.
