Two companies were recently added to the [openSUSE Sponsors](https://en.opensuse.org/Sponsors) page thanks to the companies generous donations to the [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) Project.

Both [Marvell](https://www.marvell.com/) and [TUXEDO Computers](https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/) have provided tangible support through donations to openSUSE to promote the use and development of Linux.

“We are thoroughly pleased to have Marvell and TUXEDO Computers as sponsors of the openSUSE Project,” said Richard Brown, chairman of the [openSUSE Board](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board). “The sponsorships support and encourage open-software development. Multiple Linux distributions and the open-source community will benefit greatly from the equipment.”

[Marvell](https://www.marvell.com/), which recently completed the acquisition of Cavium, offers a broad portfolio of infrastructure solutions. Marvell donated a [ThunderX2](https://www.cavium.com/product-thunderx2-arm-processors.html) system to the [openSUSE Project](https://en.opensuse.org/Main_Page). The Dual-System-on-Chip machine with 256GB RAM and 240GB SSD will extend the existing fleet of ARM build hardware. This 64-bit [ThunderX2](https://www.cavium.com/product-thunderx2-arm-processors.html) system will bring an additional 40 ARMv8 (AArch64) concurrent build jobs to the openSUSE [Open Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/), which can now provide its users with faster AArch64 package and installation image builds.

[TUXEDO Computers](https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/) makes Linux hardware, notebooks and more. The company, which offers its [TUXEDO InfinityBook Pro 13](https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/Linux-Hardware/Linux-Notebooks/) with [Leap 15](https://software.opensuse.org/distributions/leap) preinstalled, has offered to send volunteers running openSUSE booths at conferences a [TUXEDO laptop](https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/) for demo purposes, which will need to be returned to [TUXEDO Computers](https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/) after demoing it at a conference. Volunteers who wish to demo a [TUXEDO laptop](https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/) at a summit, conference or other open-source technology event can request a demo laptop through a trusted person in the openSUSE. The trusted person will decide on eligibility of the volunteer on behalf of [TUXEDO Computers](https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/). Contact the openSUSE Board or an openSUSE member if you are interested. TUXEDO Computers will send out the laptop and handle return shipping.
