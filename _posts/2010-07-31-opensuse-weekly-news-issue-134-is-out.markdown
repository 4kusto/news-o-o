Welcome to this issue. This week was very interesting- The openSUSE Project has become a new Community Manager. The old Manager Joe 'zonker' Brockmeier has gone a few month ago. Now we have our new Community Manager. His Name is Jos Poortvliet from the Netherlands. If you would like to have a first impression, just visit his [Blog](http://nowwhatthe.blogspot.com/). We are looking forward to work with Jos from 1 August on. The Editors Team wishes Jos many joy with us :-)

####  [The openSUSE Project welcomes Jos Poortvliet as new Community Manager](https://news.opensuse.org/2010/07/28/the-opensuse-project-welcomes-jos-poortvliet-as-new-community-manager/)


"We™re proud to announce today that Jos Poortvliet will join the openSUSE project and Novell as openSUSE Community Manager starting on August 1. With Jos we™ve found a leader with excellent community building experience combined with a very welcoming nature, many fresh, promising ideas and a strong drive to grow the openSUSE Project. Jos holds a degree in Organisational Psychology from the University of Utrecht and has gained valuable experience in several professional roles ranging from Project Manager at KPN to Service Level Manager at Royal Bank of Scotland. Last but not least, Jos is a leading member of the KDE Marketing Team and has helped Akademy and the Gran Canaria Desktop Summit attract a vibrant and collaborative audience. (...)"  


####  [SUSE Studio: SUSE Gallery launch](http://blog.susestudio.com/2010/07/suse-gallery-launch.html)


"We're proud to announce that SUSE Gallery is now available to all Studio users! That's right, it's finally out of beta and you no longer need to opt-in to access it.  SUSE Gallery now has its own domain at susegallery.com. This will be the destination site for users who want to find an existing appliance that they can download and use immediately. It is tightly integrated with SUSE Studio, so you can still easily customize the appliances if you want to do so."  


####  [Jos Poortvliet: New job...](http://nowwhatthe.blogspot.com/2010/07/new-job.html)


"openSUSE just announced that I will be joining them. Yay, I'll be part of the masses of Free Software contributors who are doing what they love to do, full time, supported by a paycheck!  **The job** Novell has hired me as the new openSUSE community manager. I've got some big shoes to fill, Joe 'Zonker' Brockmeier did a great job. I've been diving into openSUSE (way too much to grasp in a short time...) and I've read several comments from people who miss him. I'm no Zonker - different people, different ideas & habits. However, I can tell you I greatly look forward to the work and I'll put all my love and energy into it ;-)"

"It's been some time since I started working on openSUSE pastebin clone with Bento theme. I had some other duties so it took some time to find some final resting place for that. Some of you asked me for a better URL. I finally found it and since today SUSE Paste is running again on new address and it is ready to serve you face-wink.png I also wrote a simple script to make it easier to use it. So you can start using it, promoting openSUSE and if you encounter any problems, don't hesitate to report them.

"Bluetooth has always been a weak link in KDE. Bluedevil has been announced, and should be tested, and included in 11.4. We can have native KDE bluetooth that works similar to gnome bluetooth, or blueman. My limited testing includes 2 phones, keyboard/mouse, and headphones. None of these devices would connect with kdebluetooth. All of them setup and connected flawlessly with bluedevil KCM module. The only problem so far is not being able to see files in dolphin when trying to browse phone files.

"Expanded support for USB 3.0, a new subsystem for the use of infra-red remote controls, and an EDAC driver for Nehalem processors are just a few of the many new or improved drivers.  In the release email on the sixth beta version of Linux 2.6.35, Torvalds indicated that it could be the last beta for this kernel version, so it's probable that the final of 2.6.35 will be released in the next few days.

"The developers behind the GNOME project have gathered in the Netherlands this week for the annual GUADEC conference. During a meeting that took place at the event, the GNOME release team made the difficult decision to delay the launch of GNOME 3, the next major version of the popular open source desktop environment.  The new version has been deemed unready for mass consumption and will need another round of refinements before it can achieve the level of maturity and robustness that is expected by the software's users. Although the news will likely disappoint some enthusiasts, it is consistent with the GNOME development community's conservative approach to release management and strong emphasis on predictability."

###  Reviews and Essays





####  [Tuxradar: Reviewed: OpenSUSE 11.3](http://www.tuxradar.com/content/reviewed-opensuse-113)


"The recent series of OpenSUSE releases seems to have been oscillating between trying to deliver the finest up-to-date apps and providing the easiest, most intuitive experience for users. History tells us that it's hard to do both simultaneously, but this release might just have managed to pull it off. We reckon it's worth 9 out of 10 - but why?  SUSE has always been a KDE kind of distro, but although they've stuck with it for the 4.x series, there's certainly a lot more Gnome love in the OpenSUSE camp these days. That doesn't extend to leaving it alone of course. The SUSE version of Gnome still uses a bottom panel and the 'slab' launcher, which makes it mimic KDE 4.x somewhat, but clearly at least an equal amount of effort has been made to make it not feel like a second-choice option.
