The release of [openSUSE Leap 15.2](https://software.opensuse.org/distributions/leap/15_2) continues to expand its use and is now available for [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) in the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/opensuse-leap-152/9mzd0n9z4m4h?activetab=pivot:overviewtab). 

Leap can be executed on top of WSL to deliver the power of openSUSE to the Windows world.

WSL is a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on Windows systems. WSL is available for 64-bit versions of Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019.

System Administrators who like using tools such as rsync, tar, grep, sed, awk, and more might be limited to corporate environments where the use of Windows is mandatory. With openSUSE Leap 15.2 for WSL, sysadmins are empowered with the freedom, ability and tools to manage systems and networks.

WSL allows users to run Bash shell scripts and GNU/Linux command-line tools like vim and emacs; languages like [NodeJS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/nodejs/setup-on-wsl2), Javascript, [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Go](https://golang.org/) and more; and services like [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). Additional software is available using openSUSE’s package manager [zypper](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Zypper_usage).

Leap 15.2 on WSL isn’t just for sysadmins; developers that want to leverage Linux and users who would like to learn it without setting up a dual-boot system or virtual machine have an opportunity to try openSUSE and a few other distributions on WSL.

Before installing any Linux distributions on Windows, users must enable the "Windows Subsystem for Linux" optional feature. Documentation about using WSL is available on the [openSUSE wiki](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:WSL) and on [Microsoft’s quickstart guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
