![Geeko at work](/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/m3geeko1.jpg)

The third of seven scheduled milestone releases for 11.3 was completed and released on [schedule](http://en.opensuse.org/Roadmap). Milestone 3 focuses on using GCC 4.5 as the default compiler, leaving a great deal of the work in the hands of the openSUSE Build Service after a few issues (such as [kernel panics](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=582222)) were resolved.

<!-- more -->


## Here's what you may find interesting in the new release:





	
  * A bug in Milestone 2 prevented mounting of encrypted home folders.  This has been [resolved](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=581339).

	
  * zypper can now [interrupt](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=580513) PackageKit, via dbus, eliminating a major annoyance during updates and additional installs.

	
  * A Milestone 1 issue with starting xorg on i915 hardware has finally been [resolved](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=577000).

	
  * Pam mount has been updated to the current version, as the version used  prior is "unsupported".  There are, [apparently](https://features.opensuse.org/305351), some  config file changes to be aware of.


Gnome/GTK desktop users:

	
  * Qt has been [removed](https://features.opensuse.org/308826) from the Gnome Live CD, clearing room to potentially add some more apps.  Sax2 was removed in the process, because it has been mostly deprecated by xorg's much-improved auto detection.

	
  * [epdfview](http://trac.emma-soft.com/epdfview/), a pdf viewer akin to evince but without any gnome-lib dependencies, is now included.


KDE desktop users:

	
  * The network-manager applet has gotten a usability [update](https://features.opensuse.org/308188), in the form of an updated icon set.


Kernel hackers:

	
  * Crash, the core dump analyzer, is now at version [5.0.1](http://www.mail-archive.com/crash-utility@redhat.com/msg01957.html).


Perl developers:

	
  * Dozens of libraries have been incrementally updated along with the core [update](https://features.opensuse.org/307820) to 5.10.1.


Distribution/Appliance builders:

	
  * Kiwi [no longer](https://features.opensuse.org/308407) has mandatory dependencies on openSUSE-branded packages.

	
  * [Grub2](http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub-2.en.html) is now included, although there are currently no plans to use it by default.




## Testing! Testing! Testing!


As this is a milestone release, 11.3 milestone 3 does contain bugs that we know about, but should not stand between courageous contributors and release testing. The big bugs in 11.3 milestone 3 are:


### General





	
  * YaST logs are truncated unless Y2MAXLOGSIZE=10000 is given as parameter in linuxrc.

	
  * Network installations will complain about wrong SHA1sum for cracklib-dict-full (hotfix applied, real fix W.I.P.)

	
  * Unable to install in VirtualBox [Bug #576681](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=576681)




###  LXDE 





	
  * rcxdm stop doesn't stop lxdm [Bug #584573](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=584573)

	
  * openbox crasch with SIGABRT with gcc 4.5 ([Bug #585974](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=585974)) _(workaround: upgrade from X11:lxde or openSUSE:Factory repo)_


You can track the [most annoying bugs on the wiki](http://en.opensuse.org/Bugs:Most_Annoying_Bugs_11.3_dev) along with 11.3 development. If you want to make sure 11.3 final is free of annoying bugs, weâ€™ll need your help finding, reporting, and fixing those hidden bugs.

To learn more about testing openSUSE, visit the[ Testing pages](http://en.opensuse.org/Testing) on the openSUSE wiki. To follow the testing and development process, we suggest that you subscribe to the openSUSE-Factory mailing list ([Subscribe](mailto:opensuse-factory+subscribe@opensuse.org) | [Help](mailto:opensuse-factory+help@opensuse.org) | [Archives](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/)) and join the #openSUSE-Factory channel on Freenode to discuss openSUSE development.

The next openSUSE Milestone is scheduled to be released on Thursday, March the 25th, with additional new features and bug fixes.
