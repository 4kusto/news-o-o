![oscfinal]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/oscfinal-1-300x214.png)There are 15 more days to submit a proposal for the [openSUSE Conference](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC16) in Nuremberg June 22 - 26, so I would like to provide an update to the community about the conference.

As you might already be aware, there will be [SaltStack](http://saltstack.com/), [ownCloud](https://owncloud.org/), [Kolab](https://kolab.org/) and SUSE Labs summits during the conference and we also plan on having a [program for kids](https://coderdojo.com/) on Saturday, June 25.

The planning of the conference is coming along well. There will be a pre-conference party at the [Kater Murr](http://kater-murr.com/) starting at 7 p.m. June 21. There will be plenty of entertainment during the week as well.

Everyday, there will be a keynote. The keynote speakers who have confirmed are [Norman Fraser, Ph.D.](http://softiron.co.uk/about/), who is the CEO of SoftIron, [Frank Karlitschek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Karlitschek) from ownCloud, and[ Michael Miller](https://www.suse.com/company/executive-management/), President of Strategy, Alliances & Marketing for SUSE. We will have one more keynote as well, but we have not confirmed it yet.

The conference page has a list of hotels that are recommended, so if you haven’t booked your hotel, take a look at the list.

The [T-Shirt Design Contest](http://bit.ly/20Prrt0) ends on April 2 and during our next organizing meeting, we will announce the winner of the contest and start getting the T-Shirts printed for the conference. Thank you to all the people who have submitted a design. There is still two days left to submit a design.

We have several sponsors for this year’s conference and we are looking forward to seeing everyone there.

openSUSE will have [HackWeek](https://hackweek.suse.com/) the week following the conference, but it will kick off on Friday, June 24 and continue into the next week, so if you feel like hanging around Nuremberg for [HackWeek](https://hackweek.suse.com/), we will have a place for you to Hack at the SUSE Headquarters from June 27 to July 1. Participate in one of the projects listed or make one on the [website](https://hackweek.suse.com/).
