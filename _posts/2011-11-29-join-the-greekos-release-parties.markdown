The **openSUSE 12.1** distribution is released. After _8 months_ of hard work by the openSUSE community, the result could be something less than awesome. It is true that openSUSE 12.1 has received the best reviews of all famous open source sites and also has begun to gain many new members at the community, users and contributors.



**Time to celebrate!**

As is known the openSUSE community after the hard work done to release another great distribution, wants to celebrate it! And why not! Around the world communities, Linux groups and LUGs organize release parties.



**The G(r)eekos Way!!!**

openSUSE 12.1 is already installed on our machines by **November 16**. The Greek openSUSE community in collaboration with other communities, university Linux teams and LUGs invites you to come and celebrate the brand new release of openSUSE 12.1. Release parties are organized in many Greek cities! If you're near a city where a party is organized do not hesitate to meet us, attend an _Install Fest_ or a _presentation_ about openSUSE 12.1, **drink lots of beers**, **talk **with us and **have fun**!

We expect to meet you at one of the parties, as well as help you organize one in your town! Good company, beer and goodwill are the key ingredients of a successful Release party!

On **Thursday 1 December** we will celebrate in **Larisa** with a presentation and an Install Fest at 13:00 and afterward we will go at a local tsipouradiko. Moreover, on **Saturday 3 December** in **Kastoria** at 19:00 at Zaza bar. Furthermore, on **Sunday 4 December** we will celebrate in **Thesaloniki** at Bar Pierrot Le Fou at 22:00. Last but not least there will be 3 more parties that are going to be announcend the next few days.

**Have a lot of fun!**
