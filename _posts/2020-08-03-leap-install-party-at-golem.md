*Italian Linux users did an openSUSE Leap 15.2 Launch Party, at the 
local LUG (it's called GOLEM, it's in a small town in central Italy), 
and [Dario Faggioli](https://twitter.com/DarioFaggioli/) made a quick report.*

We have space outside, so we could do an actual physical event and
still respect the social distancing restrictions which are continue to
hold here in Italy.

First of all, this meant that I could bring and distribute the super-
awesome swags that Doug sent me. And I really want to thank him a lot
one more time for shipping them over extremely quickly. They are great
and people loved them!

Ah, the event was also recorded, but they still have to let me know
whether that worked well or not.

I decided to do a live install as I think our installer is great, and
wanted to show it off a bit. :-) In fact, I've heard a few times people
saying that installing openSUSE is difficult, and I wanted to give it a
shot to busting that myth.

I showed how it is possible to install the distro with just a few
clicks, which is the opposite of difficult. After that, I went back and
explained all the various possible customizations that one can make --
but only if she wants to-- at each stage.

Feedback on this was extremely good, and I think I'm going to reuse
this same approach for other similar occasions.

While the installer was copying packages, there was the time to talk a
bit about the characteristics of Leap such as its goals, release cycle,
development process, relationship with SLE, etc.

I quickly mentioned the maintenance process, taking advantage of some
slides kindly provided by Marina (thanks to you again as well!), and
this also was perceived as very interesting.

After the system was ready, I had the time to showcase YaST a little,
to explain how to add Packman repos for the codecs and to introduce
BTRFS snapshots, snapper and demo a reboot into a previous snapshot and
the rollback.

I managed to hint quickly at [OBS](https://openbuildservice.org), but there was only the time to
mention [OpenQA](https://open.qa), and I couldn't give them a meaningful tour of these
two.

People where curious and interested, so I call the event a success.

They asked questions mainly about YaST, BTRFS and zypper. Plus two
more, rather specific ones:
 1) Why don't we ship/install multimedia codec by default (even the
    proprietary and patent encumbered ones), like Ubuntu and even
    Debian?
 2) Why don't we use an LTS kernel for Leap?

Just to be clear, I'm not actually asking the questions here. :-)

I just felt it would be useful to report this, especially considering
that I hear these being asked pretty often, during various events or in
various channels or forums.

Anyways, I honestly think the event was a good one, considering that
we're a small LUG from a small place and that we're still elbow deep
inside a pandemic. :-/

And we're already planning a similar event about Tumbleweed! Not a
release party, probably... or maybe yes: I just have to make it
coincide with the publishing of a TW snapshot, which should not be too
difficult after all. :-P
