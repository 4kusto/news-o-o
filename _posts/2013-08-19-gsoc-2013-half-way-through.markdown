We have reached the half way stage of the Google Summer of Code 2013, and it has been an exciting journey so far. A lot of good work has been done this summer on a variety of projects. This year, we have co-participated with ownCloud, Balabit (syslog-ng) and Hedgewars under the openSUSE umbrella. Here follows a summary of the work that has been done so far, along with the experiences of the students.


## AppArmor Profile Tool


Kshitij Gupta is developing profile tools for AppArmor, which involves writing the perl tools and core modules in python. He is being mentored by Christian Boltz. The tools are expected to be completed on time, since they are built on the core modules. Kshitij labels working on the GSoC project as a 'phenomenal' time.

## OBS Discussion System


Shayon Mukherjee is building a discussion system for the Open Build Service, under the guidance of Henne and Adrian. The results have been pretty good so far. According to Shayon, they have built the functionality for the users to be able to post comments on projects, packages and requests in the Open Build Service. They are really excited and believe its a great functionality, and that users of the OBS will benefit greatly from it. Before GSoC ends, they plan to make it possible for users to edit/delete comments via Hermes, the openSUSE notification system. He adds that he has learned a lot in the last month about a complicated, full stack web app.

The initial result of the application can be found in action [here](https://build.opensuse.org/project/comments/openSUSE:Factory).

## OSEM


Stella (differentreality) is working on Open Source Event Management Tool(OSEM), mentored by Theo Chatzimichos, and Matt Barringer. We saw her work in action at the openSUSE Conference and we're all wondering how she managed to combine working on OSEM with organizing the event... On the other hand, the practical needs were driving OSEM development and this of course leads to a very good application and more fun.


## User Management Application on ownCloud


Raghu Nayyar is writing the User Management Application for ownCloud. He has written the front end on AngularJS and is currently working on syncing it with the backend. He will also be working on the front end of the files application, which forms a major part of ownCloud. He is being mentored by Jan Christoph Bochardt and Posselt Bernhard.

## Music App for ownCloud


Morris Jobke is working on the Music App for ownCloud, based on a RESTful API. Morris plans to add support for playlist management and the music filtering. He is being mentored by Jorn Friedrich Dreyer and Posselt Bernhard.


## Syslog-ng MySQL destination:


Gyula Petrovics is writing the MySQL Destination driver for syslog-ng. The idea is to insert syslog messages into a MySQL database. Gyula is being mentored by Victor Tusa.

## Hedgewars Campaign Mission


Periklis Ntanasis is creating a new Hedgewars Mission campaign. He is about halfway from the end, and is quite satisfied with the end result so far. He is being mentored by kyber (nemo) from Hedgewars


## Other Projects:


The other projects in action for Google Summer of Code are:



	
  * Github Code Review for CLI, by Xystushi, under bamboo

	
  * Automatic Resizing of LVM Volumes by Akif Khan, under Dinar Valeev

	
  * IaaS Cloud Framework for software packaging and documentation by intijk, under Robert Schweikert

	
  * syslog-ng redis destination by tichy, under Gergely Nagy


So far, it has been an awesome ride, with the coding work going at full swing. Now, the students must Geeko up to scrub code, write test cases and finish the documentation tasks. The Soft Pencils Down' date is September 16, followed by the 'Firm Pencils Down' date on 23rd September.
