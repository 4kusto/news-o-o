Preparations for the openSUSE.Asia Summit are rolling. As we are busy prepping ourselves for this big event, we realized that we need a logo for our very own Summit. Following tradition, we are back with the logo contest. We are looking for a logo which best reflects openSUSE and its community in Asia. The contest is open now and ends on _**19 September **__**2015**_. We will send a “Geeko Mystery Box” as an appreciation for the best logo designed.




The **Rules** of the Contest are as follows:
