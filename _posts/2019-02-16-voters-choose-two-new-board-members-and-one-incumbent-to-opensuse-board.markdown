({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Christian_Boltz.jpeg) _**Christian Boltz aka cboltz, incumbent**_

The results are in and the Voting [Members](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Members) have chosen incumbent **[Christian Boltz aka cboltz](https://news.opensuse.org/2019/01/21/2018-2019-opensuse-board-elections-meet-incumbent-christian-boltz/)**, new Board Member [**Marina Latini aka deneb_alpha**](https://news.opensuse.org/2019/01/26/2018-2019-opensuse-board-elections-meet-marina-latini/), and new Board Member [**Dr. Axel Braun aka DocB**](https://news.opensuse.org/2019/01/22/21530/) to fill the three vacant seats on the [openSUSE Board](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board) for the next two years.

Out of 446 eligible voters, 46 more openSUSE Members than last elections, only 231 -- 6 fewer than last elections -- chose to cast their votes, leaving last spring's elections holding the record both for most ballots cast and largest percentage of Members who took enough interest in [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) to take the time to cast their votes.

Incumbent **[Christian Boltz aka cboltz](https://news.opensuse.org/2019/01/21/2018-2019-opensuse-board-elections-meet-incumbent-christian-boltz/)** garnered the most votes with a total of 141 votes -- more than half of those who voted -- confirming the [Community's](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Members) confidence in him.  He was followed closely by [**Marina Latini aka deneb_alpha**](https://news.opensuse.org/2019/01/26/2018-2019-opensuse-board-elections-meet-marina-latini/) with 119 votes -- also more than half of the active voters -- and [**Dr. Axel Braun aka DocB**](https://news.opensuse.org/2019/01/22/21530/) with 104 votes, almost half.

As incumbent, Christian is already sitting on the Board and will continue his duties for his second two-year term.  Marina and Axel are expected to join him and take their seats for their first two-year terms sometime within the next couple of weeks.

The runners-up in this tough-to-decide race included three other impressive Candidates:  [**Incumbent Sarah Julia Kriesch aka AdaLovelace**](https://news.opensuse.org/2019/01/23/2018-2019-opensuse-board-elections-meet-incumbent-sarah-julia-kriesch/) with 98 votes, [**Vinzenz Vietzke aka vinzv**](https://news.opensuse.org/2019/01/25/2018-2019-opensuse-board-elections-meet-vinzenz-vietzke/) with 78 votes, [**Nathan Wolf aka futureboy and CubicleNate**](https://news.opensuse.org/2019/01/26/2018-2019-opensuse-board-elections-meet-nathan-wolf/) with 54 votes, and [**Sébastien Poher aka sogal**](https://news.opensuse.org/2019/01/24/2018-2019-opensuse-board-elections-meet-sebastien-poher/) with 51 votes.  Unfortunately, only three seats were vacant, as these three people would also have been valuable additions to the Board.


## Next Elections Expected Less Than a Year in Fall of 2019


The [Elections Committee for the 2018-2019 openSUSE Board Elections](mailto:election-officials@opensuse.org) -- Ish Sookun, Edwin Zakaria, and Gerry Makaro -- sincerely hope that the runners up will step up to run again in the next elections as two seats will be up for election, one for Simon Lees, who will be finishing his first two-year term, and the other to replace Gertjan Lettink, who will be ending his second two-year term on the Board.

Board Members can only hold two consecutive two-year terms under [openSUSE rules](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election_rules).

The Elections Committee would like to thank all the Community Members who stepped up to the plate and performed their Membership Duties in order to support [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/), the [Project](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Project), and the [Community](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Members) in this elections process.  You can find out more about the [**Elections and the Candidates at the Official Wiki Page.**](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election)
