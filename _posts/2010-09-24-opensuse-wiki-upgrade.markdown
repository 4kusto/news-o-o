We have just completed the upgrade to the 1.16 release of MediaWiki.Â  This release comes with several improvements in functionality and performance.Â  Anyone who is interested in more information can view the release notes [here](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Release_notes/1.16).

As part of this deployment, 6 additional wikis (Dutch, French, Greek, Portugese, Russian, and Spanish) have been converted to the new wiki system.Â  These wikis now have the same themes and functionality as the English wiki, including Lucene search.

Later today, we will be moving the wiki files to the data center SAN.Â  The wikis should remain live throughout the entire process.Â  However, file uploads will be disabled and anyone editing the wiki faces a small risk of losing their session.Â  A warning message will be posted on the wiki during this move, which should take less than an hour.
