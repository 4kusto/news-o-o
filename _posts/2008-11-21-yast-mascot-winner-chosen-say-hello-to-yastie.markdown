The openSUSE Project and YaST team are happy to announce the winner of the [YaST Mascot Contest](//news.opensuse.org/2008/10/21/yast-mascot-contest/). After extensive deliberation, the judges have chosen the [Aardvark concept](http://en.opensuse.org/Image:Fixme.png), submitted by KlÃ¡ra CihlÃ¡Å™ovÃ¡.

The judges have also settled on a name for the mascot, which will be called Yastie.

We had a lot of great submissions, and it wasn't easy picking the best idea out of the bunch. We received a number of high-quality submissions, and it's clear that a lot of thought and hard work went into each submission. Thanks to everyone who participated, it shows just how important YaST is to the community.

As we mentioned in the contest guidelines, we were looking for an idea for the mascot, and not necessarily the final artwork. We want to make sure that the YaST Mascot fits with other openSUSE artwork and branding. Our own Jakub Steiner (jimmac) is going to work on the final artwork, and we'll be showing that very soon.

Thanks again to everyone who participated! With years [homework-writer.com](https://homework-writer.com/) of experience in providing ibm ibm maximo asset management v7
