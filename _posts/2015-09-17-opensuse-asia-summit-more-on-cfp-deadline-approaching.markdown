Time is running out fast!!! We already have an impressive list of proposals, but hey, it does not hurt to be greedy. Submit your proposals for the openSUSE.Asia Summit 2015, which will be held from Dec'05 - Dec'06 2015 in Taipei City. Every proposal makes our Summit better.

Just to remind you again, we have the following formats. Each proposal has a word limit of 150 words.![geeko+](/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/geeko+.png)



	
  * Lightning Talk (10 mins)

	
  * Short Talk (30 mins)

	
  * Long Talk (<del>60</del> 45 mins) Â _[If you thought that will take less than 60 minutes but more than 30 minutes, then this is the revised format]_

	
  * Workshop (3 hours)


The openSUSE.Asia committee highly recommends workshops or hands on sessions. Papers can be submitted at the conference [website ](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/summitasia15)by September 25, 2015.
