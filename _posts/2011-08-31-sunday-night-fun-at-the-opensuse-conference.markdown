There's lots of fun things planned for our openSUSE Conference this year and you'll be sure to find something entertaining during the afterhours, all while enjoying a nice cold bottle of openSUSE Beer.

On Sunday the kick off day to our conference, we have two fun events planned:

(Old HW Guy)

[![Speedy Geeko 2011 Logo](/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/speedy-geeko.png)](//news.opensuse.org/?attachment_id=10448)Immediately following Old HW Guy, we'll be kicking off our first ever SpeedyGeeko.  It's a lightning talk with a twist.  Here's how it works:



	
  * 10 slots are reserved for Presenters

	
  * Each Presenter gets 5 minutes to present their topic

	
  * Each Presenter will present with 20 slides

	
  * The slides progress every 15 seconds whether the speaker is ready or not.


You can already begin to see how crazy things will get as presenters try to keep up with their own slides!

And what kind of topics will be presented?  Literally anything you want (as long as it is not offensive).  Presenters can talk about their favorite open source project, do a song-and-dance routine, talk about a funny story that happened to them, or even just do a 5 minute review of their baby pictures.  And the topics do not have to be related to openSUSE.

This is your chance to express your creative side.  Or talk about your favorite subject that you didn't see in the regular openSUSE Conference program.

We have a few slots still open.  If you're interested, contact <insert contact method> to reserve your 5 minute slot now!
