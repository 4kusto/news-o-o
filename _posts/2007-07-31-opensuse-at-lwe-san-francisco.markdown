Just a short/last reminder ... We, Seth Arnold and /me, will be at [LWE in San Francisco](http://www.linuxworldexpo.com/) next week (06-09.08). You can find us at the .org pavilion, booth 20. If you are interested in Enterprise solutions, visit also the Novell booth, #702.  We will show the latest alpha and of course we are there to talk with you about everything you always wanted to know about openSUSE. :-)

There will be also one talk about the openSUSE Build Service:
[BOF8: OpenSUSE Build Service - Package Building Made Easy](http://www.linuxworldexpo.com/live/12/events/12SFO07A/conference/tracksessions//QMONYB001HWN)

See you in San Francisco!
