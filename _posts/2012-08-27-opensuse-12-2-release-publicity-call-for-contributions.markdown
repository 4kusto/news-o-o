[![Agustin, Ismael and Christopher working around a table on openSUSE release PR](/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Boosters-boosting-122-release.jpg)](http://news.opensuse.org/2012/08/27/opensuse-12-2-release-publicity-call-for-contributions/boosters-boosting-122-release/)As we enter the final straight towards the release of openSUSE 12.2, the openSUSE Team is busy preparing the release publicity. And this is where you, the openSUSE community come in. There are lots of ways you can help us share the workload. If you want to take on one of these jobs, mail the [opensuse-project list](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/) to announce your contribution.


# Screenshots


Look at the feature list, and if there is a feature there that you are familiar with and that looks good, snapshot it (according to the guidelines) and add them to the feature list or upload it to the openSUSE [wiki page for general 12.2 screenshots](http://en.opensuse.org/12.2_Screenshots).


# Release Parties


This is probably the easiest way to contribute.[ Throw a release party](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Launch_parties) with your friendly penguins and show them what's cool about openSUSE 12.2


# Social Media


We need a plan for announcing the 12.2 release on social media. Â If you're a social animal, volunteer to lead this for 12.2 on the Project list.


# Sneak Peeks


People with detailed knowledge of specific areas of openSUSE are encouraged to help us write in-depth Sneak Peek articles. Â The following topics are suggested:



	
  * KDE

	
  * GNOME

	
  * XFCE

	
  * Creative applications

	
  * Developer applications

	
  * [Merging /usr/bin and /binÂ ](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:UsrMerge)

	
  * Your idea!




# Release Article Translations


Translate any of the above articles, the feature list (if you're feeling tough), the product highlights into your language and promote them to your local blogs and news sites.


# Bug Days


Organising a bug review and triage day for a specific area of openSUSE is one of the most effective ways to build a good team, increase their skills and familiarity with the technical side of our distribution. Â Everyone can spot a bug, right? Look at ten bugs and everyone can perceive a pattern close the duplicates, andÂ or spot the simi


# Upgrade Instructions


The[ Support Database article on upgrading between openSUSE versions](http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:System_upgrade) was last updated for openSUSE 11.4! Â This would be easy to update, but keep in mind that for 12.2 the online update repositories [have been split between Free and proprietary software](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=768639), so both need to be added.
