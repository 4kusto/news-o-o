The [openSUSE Project](https://www.opensuse.org/) has posted [results](https://en.opensuse.org/Maintainers-surveys_2021) from a recent survey that ran between Oct. 7 and Oct. 29.

The aim was to gather more information from open-source developers, development teams, packagers and maintainers. The survey also aimed to determine the satisfaction level of contributors and better understand the complexities and challenges they encounter with the project's development. The survey provided an area to comment and provide suggestions to improve relevant aspects of the project and its tools.

An email to the [factory mailing list](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/62EI7HY4X6JVULYYFZILFYRTF7VNXVOE/) about the results has provided fun discussions. The highest majority of people submitting the survey were between the ages of 35 and 49. Almost 90 percent were from the northern hemisphere and almost 60 percent had a university degree. A vast majority had or are working in the Information Technology field. On average, maintainers and packagers interact with 11.34 people for their development projects.

More information about the results can be found on the [openSUSE wiki](https://en.opensuse.org/Maintainers-surveys_2021).
