Announcement about my Contribution in the **openSUSE
        Conference**...

As i checked the [Timetable](http://conference.opensuse.org/indico//conferenceTimeTable.py?confId=2#all.detailed) from the Conference, i've seen that i'm holding the Workshop at Monday
      from 9:30 h to 10:15 h. I'm happy about that. The official Abstract can be viewed [there](http://conference.opensuse.org/indico//contributionDisplay.py?contribId=81&sessionId=4&confId=2). (...)

[Jan Weber: Keysigning Party at openSUSE
        Conference 2011](http://www.luckylemon.de/?p=91)

Just like at last years conference, this years openSUSE conference will also feature a
      keysigning party, read on to find out how to participate and what to do. 

**What is a Keysigning Party (KSP) **

A key signing party is a get-together of people who use the PGP encryption system with the
      purpose of allowing those people to sign each others keys. Key signing parties serve to extend
      the web of trust to a great degree. Key signing parties also serve as great opportunities to
      discuss the political and social issues surrounding strong cryptography, individual liberties,
      individual sovereignty, and even implementing encryption technologies or perhaps future work
      on free encryption software. (...)

[Honey, your

As we continue to work towards making this years [conference](https://news.opensuse.org/category/project/events/osc/) the best
      ever, there™s one cool new thing we™ve never done before: Introducing the [openSUSE

[Fun, fun, fun at
        OSC11](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/08/22/osc11-fun/)

The Zentrifuge, our [conference
        location](http://conference.opensuse.org/location) this year, is build in an old factory that was used for the production of
      washing machines (centrifuge, get it?). The bridging between technology and art is an
      important concern for them and thus our conference, as a technology conference, tries to cross
      that bridge too. Of course we also follow our motto **Have a lot of fun¦**in this endeavor and throw a little
      party into the mix as well. So here is our blend of social events at OSC11. (...)

      [Alex Eftimie: PackageKit backend for Software Center: pencils down report](http://alex.eftimie.ro/2011/08/22/packagekit-backend-for-software-center-pencils-down-report/)
    

![](http://swarm.cs.pub.ro/~alexef/gsoc/pk-suse/Workspace%201_006.png)

Today the official coding period of GSoC 2011 ends. It™s been a four months journey, with
      challenges, failures and achievements, but nevertheless fun :-) . 

You may be wondering what is the status of my project; here it goes: current version of
      Software Center can be tested in openSUSE Factory; it can populate its database with data from
      an AppStream XML; it shows application information (fetched from the package manager); it
      installs and removes software, in the same friendly manner the ubuntu does (showing progress,
      handling dependencies). 

Moreover, my patches to [gobject-introspection](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=652256), [PackageKit](https://gitorious.org/packagekit/packagekit/commit/c2016d35d33a03c481fd0586af26426184dfd758) and obviously [software-center](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~software-store-developers/software-center/trunk/revision/2146), are all upstream and released; kudos to the project managers and
      the community for helping me get them there.

August looks like a surprisingly busy month, we already have 709 package checkins and
        thus I expect we'll beat the 926 from last month. Also, there's a lot to write about since
        the last [report](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/08/05/factory-progress-2011-08-05/). 

Note that the Milestone 4 was not really released since Coolo is on vacation and we
        decided to make a soft release (just update via zypper dup) instead of a full release this
        time. 

A plea: Please help documenting major changes of factory in the [openSUSE wiki](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Upcoming_features) so that the
        marketing team can start speaking about openSUSE 12.1 and does not miss important features!

            [decouple download and installation (Score: 362)](https://features.opensuse.org/120340)
          

Network installation could be improved by running package download and package
            installation in parallel.

            [Look at plymouth for splash during boot (Score: 188)](https://features.opensuse.org/305493)
          

I wanted to open a fate feature about this when I first heard of plymouth, but
            reading
            http://fedoramagazine.wordpress.com/2008/10/21/interview-fedora-10s-better-startup/
            really makes me think we should go this way.

Ray's comment starting with "Every flicker and mode change in the boot
            process takes away from the whole experience." is especially interesting. Is it
            okay to track the "don't show grub by default" here?






            [1-click uninstall (Score: 163)](https://features.opensuse.org/305305)
          

An easy way to remove Software! For example: you installed an application with "1-click install" (which will install all the packages that you need), there should be an easy way (also with 1 click) to remove what you have installed with that 1-click operation... in another words: an "1-click Uninstall" to remove installed software (dependencies and packages included).






            [Update to GRUB v2 (Score: 145)](https://features.opensuse.org/308497)
          

Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn't
            going to go away. The code itself isn't well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It's only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don't have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)
            (...)






            [Popularity contest (Score: 108)](https://features.opensuse.org/305877)
          

We need a feedback about packages that are preferred by users and actively used. Debian already has a tool named Popularity contest (popcon)
            
          

* reusing popcon will give us results that are directly comparable with Debian and Ubuntu
          

* packagers team can take care of the package
          

* we need a configuration dialog in YaST that is visible enough
          

* we need a server infrastructure on opensuse.org. (There are certain privacy issues, see Debian FAQ for details)

            [Installing Opensuse Distro with YAST from source](https://features.opensuse.org/312756)
          

I would like to see a installation option in YAST that would allow me to install update a installed system from source. Maybe using the following steps:

1.) Do a normal install from the distribution DVD or a Network install and configure the system as required.

2.) Optionally download the sources for each library and application, compile with user specified complier flags, such as CFLAGS="-mtune=native -march=native -O3", MAKEOPTS="-j5" etc.

3.) Replace the original vanilla libraries from the distribution DVD and their updates with the complied applications.






            [Blacklist the pcspkr module by default](https://features.opensuse.org/312765)
          

The pcspkr module is used to control the computer's internal speaker, which is very rarely used on the desktop. It isn't strong enough to serve as a passable replacement for real sound devices, and it hurts the user experience more than it helps.

I have openSUSE installed on two computers, my laptop and desktop (11.3 on the laptop, 11.4/Tumbleweed on the desktop), and on both computers I've had to disable the PC speaker because otherwise it would beep very loudly every time I would shut down or restart. It seems to me that this behavior was intended more for server than desktop use.

Having to spend the time to learn what the speaker is, what drives it, and how to disable it is obviously not a great experience. I think it would be better for end users to have this module disabled by default, and if any seasoned admins really want it back, they know how to re-enable it.

      [OStatic/Susan Linton: My
        Favorite Little Games](http://ostatic.com/blog/my-favorite-little-games)
    

"Little games" is a term I use to describe those that are quick to start, easy to play,
      and quick to exit. These are the ones that usually come installed by default with most Linux
      distributions. Some have GNOME and KDE counterparts, but all are fun. Here are a few of my
      favorites.

1. **KMahjongg**

KMahjongg is basically a tile matching game. It really doesn't require any specialized
      skills. In fact, it really only requires reasonable eyesight and the ability to click a mouse.
      The object is to clear the board by clicking matching tiles until all are removed. It bears no
      real connection to the ancient Chinese tile game of the same name, which as I understand it,
      actually plays much like our classic card game Rummy. KMahjongg is the version that ships with
      KDE, but I'm just almost sure there is a version for GNOME. But it's a great time-killer with
      each game taking about five or 10 minutes to complete. Your score can be saved at the end of
      each board, and you can save your game at any point and come back to it later.

      [Linus Torvalds: Linux 3.1-rc3](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1182531)
    

It's a day late - I was just too hungry tired after the DM class to
release it yesterday. But there it is, all fresh and new.

And a few thank-yous are in order: things are looking good. The
diffstat looks reasonable (the one big addition is in Documentation),
and while I could have wished for even less churn, I'm pretty happy.
The rc2 to rc3 shortlog is appended, and I think it mostly looks
pretty reasonable and short. Which is not to say that I'm not hoping
that things will calm down even further in the later rc's, but at
least so far I don't think I've had much reason to complain.

Another thank-you goes to Intel: this release has been full of travel
(happily now all completed), first due to a week of vacation during
the merge window, and then for my DM class weekends and LinuxCon. And
the new laptop made it much less painful to do even "allmodconfig"
builds while on the road.

So go out and test. (...)

### For Desktop Users




        [Hubfolio/Matthew Casperson: Positioning windows automatically in Gnome 3](http://www.brighthub.com/hubfolio/matthew-casperson/blog/archive/2011/08/18/positioning-windows-automatically-in-gnome-3.aspx)
      

One of the best features of Gnome 3 are the dynamic workspaces. Using some simple [keyboard shortcuts](http://www.brighthub.com/hubfolio/matthew-casperson/blog/archive/2011/05/25/efficient-application-switching-with-gnome-3.aspx), it is possible to assign an application to a workspace and quickly switch between them. If you run a standard set of applications, this process makes switching between them very efficient.

The problem with running applications in their own workspace is that you have to spend some time once Gnome 3 has booted moving the applications to their proper workspaces. However, using a tool called [devilspie](http://www.foosel.org/linux/devilspie), it is possible to setup a script that will automatically rearrange your windows for you. (...)

In the last few tutorials we have been looking at various parts of what make up a graphical user interface.   We™ve created labels and buttons and have attached images to a label (and a button if you did the homework).  We have also associated an action with pressing a button.   In this tutorial we™re going to put these together to make a simple image viewer application.  As with the previous tutorials, this will only work with images which are saved as a gif format.  Also, a word of warning “ you need to do pretty much all of the code before any of it will work.

Here are some images for you to use.  As with the earlier tutorial, you can either use ˜save as™ to download a copy, or you can use the Python code in the note below to download them (if you use Python you should be in your python4kids directory when you do the download otherwise the files will get saved somewhere else).  A gold star if you use Python for the download. (...)

        [Dan Vratil: Akonadi Google Resource: complete rewrite](http://progdan.cz/2011/08/akonadi-google-resource-complete-rewrite/)
      

today I finally pushed a completely new version of the Akonadi Google Resource. Since
        last update cca 2 months ago I™ve completely rewritten the resources, moving most of the
        functionality into libKGoogle . The library now provides access to Google services and can
        be easily used by any other project. So what™s new? A lot of things changed for programmers.
        I™ve begun to fulfill my threats about providing a C++/Qt library for accessing Google
        Services. It™s not pure Qt, I™m using some KDE stuff in there, but that will change.

LibKGoogle now provides API similar to QNetworkAccessManager (KGoogleAccessManager)
        through which you can send KGoogleRequest and if it works, you™ll receive a KGoogleReply.
        Each Google Service is represented by a KGoogleService subclass, implementing XML and/or
        JSON parser and serializer and providing informations about fetch/create/update URLs. Each
        object (contact, event, calendar) is represented by KGoogleObject subclass. For now, Event
        class is implements KCalCore::Event as well, the Calendar and Contact classes provide their
        own implementation of everything. Porting it to KABC/KCalCore is on TODO. (...)

        [h-online/Dr. Oliver Diedrich: The history of Linux](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/The-history-of-Linux-1331088.html)
      

**When Linus Torvalds released Linux 0.01 on the internet 20 years ago, his idea of a free Unix clone to which anyone could contribute touched a creativenerve in people. Today, it would be impossible to imagine an IT world without Linux.**

It has been twenty years since Linus Torvalds programmed the first few lines of what
        would become the Linux kernel. An IT student at the time, Torvalds wasn't yet thinking of an
        operating system, he just wanted to explore the capabilities of his PC's 386 processor.
        Eventually, his memory management, process switching and I/O experiments developed into
        something that resembled a rudimentary operating system kernel. (...)

The Linux kernel was originally created by Linus Torvalds, a Finnish computer science
        student, and first announced to the world on August 25, 1991”exactly 20 years ago today. At
        the time, Torvalds described his work as a "hobby" and contended that it would not be "big
        and professional" like the GNU project.

But the Linux kernel turned out to be one of the most significant pieces of open source
        software ever developed. Over the past two decades, it has grown from a humble hobby project
        into a global phenomenon that runs on everything from low-cost e-book readers to a majority
        of the world's supercomputers. Here's how it grew.

Linux and open source development is not a zero sum game.

There are many ways to thrive within the open source ecosystem.

The [Yocto project](http://www.yoctoproject.org/) is working on this for the embedded space, just as SUSE, under the fresh leadership of Attachmate, is making available their [Open Build Service](http://openbuildservice.org/) to help people roll packages for multiple distributions.

        [Free Software Foundation/Brett Smith: Android GPLv2 termination worries: one more reason to upgrade to GPLv3](http://www.fsf.org/news/android-termination-upgrade-gplv3)
      

**Distributors lose their rights when they violate GPLv2, but the Free Software Foundation is more forgiving in its license enforcement to encourage continued participation in the free software community. GPLv3 has improved termination provisions to codify this approach, giving developers one more reason to upgrade.**

Thanks to Android's commercial success, the kernel Linux, which is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2, is being distributed more than ever before. Whenever someone distributes GPL-covered software, they must follow a few conditions set forth in the license. These conditions try to give anyone who receives the software both the legal permission and the practical tools necessary to change and share the software themselves if they wish.

Not all of the companies that distribute Android heed these conditions. We've witnessed an uptick in GPL violation reports”some convincing, others incomplete or misinformed”against these vendors. We generally can't pursue these violations directly, because only copyright holders can enforce free software licenses in most countries, and few Android devices use FSF-copyrighted code. However, people still seek out our opinions about the relevant parts of the GPL, and that discussion has recently turned to GPLv2's termination provisions. Section 4 of the license says, You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. (...)

        [Das U-Blog/Prashanth Venkataram: Revisited: openSUSE 11.4 GNOME](http://dasublogbyprashanth.blogspot.com/2011/08/revisited-opensuse-114-gnome.html)
      

If you guessed again that there isn't much else to write about, you'd be right! That's why I'm looking at openSUSE 11.4 GNOME today.

A few months ago, I took a look at openSUSE 11.4 KDE. Before that, I had compared openSUSE 11.3 KDE to other distributions that primarily used KDE. I found that version 11.4 was a dramatic improvement over version 11.3, to the point where I heartily recommended it to anyone who wanted to try it. It was fairly fast, stable, looked great, and had or could easily get all the applications I wanted. But to call openSUSE a primarily KDE distribution is slightly misleading, because while openSUSE does indeed try to promote KDE a little more, it puts just as much effort into making the GNOME edition a unique experience as well. Plus, the developers that created openSUSE also created Mono, which is basically the C# programming language for Linux, and helped develop the applications written in it that are now popularly used in many GNOME distributions, such as the Evolution mail client (UPDATE: Evolution is not written in Mono, though it was developed by the same group/a group close to that one that developed openSUSE ” thanks to an anonymous reader for the correction), Tomboy note-taking application, F-Spot photo manager, and GNOME-Do launcher. So I figured it's time to see what openSUSE GNOME is really like. (...)
