> Next years [FOSDEM](http://www.fosdem.org/2011/) takes place again in
      Brussels on Feb 5th and 6th 2011 and openSUSE will be present as usual!
> 
> Apart of the well known high level open Source tech conference there will be for the 2nd
      time the Distribution [Miniconf](http://www.fosdem.org/2011/distrominiconf).
      The Miniconf provides the perfect place for different projects to share ideas, talk about
      challenges each project has and to foster collaboration – and as openSUSE is all about
      collaboration we want to play a major role there.
> 
> The Miniconf is open for every project. For more information please subscribe on the
      Miniconf [mailinglist](http://lists.fosdem.org/mailman/listinfo/dist2011).
      We are looking for talks about cross-distro collaboration and presentations on openSUSE
      technology – like OBS, openFATE but also where we are going – things like Tumbleweed!
> 
> Our contact with FOSDEM is [Henne
        Vogelsang](http://en.opensuse.org/User:Hennevogel), if you think about giving a talk, contact him.

> In February 2010 openSUSE held the openSUSE survey 2010 to find out more about the community. Who are the openSUSE users? What do they want? Who are our contributors? 
      What motivates them? How can openSUSE improve? These questions and more have, to some extend, been answered by the over 27.000 participants in the three months the survey 
      was live. Just before the end of the year we finally managed to get the winner of the Chumby Figure 1, “The elusive Thirsty Thirteen” his prize. Konrad Schlichtherle from Dortmund, 
      Germany, is the lucky winner. Read on for more!
> 
> **Winners**
> 
> The winners of the prizes we gave away were, in no particular order:
> 
>   * Yosef Peretz from Jerusalem Israel
> 
>   * Carlos Gárzon from Colombia
> 
>   * Mityunin Alexander Vladimirovich from Russia
> 
>   * Dong Xiaoyan from China
> 
>   * Mar’yan Rachynskyy from Ukraine
> 
>   * Roland Ortmann from Germany
> 
>   * Sergey Goncharuk from Russia
> 
>   * Wolodja Pskowskaja from Russia
> 
> And the main prize, the Chumby, went to **Konrad Schlichtherle** from Germany.
> 
> We managed to catch Konrad on IRC – he is currently not involved with Free Software but looking to change that so tips for him are welcome!
>     
>     
>           News.o.o: So, Konrad, you got the Chumby?
>           Konrad: yes, i got it on the 27th. Many thanks for it. Its a nice gadget!
>           News.o.o: So it’s working for you?
>           Konrad: Yes, what else can I say about the Chumby? He stands beside me and plays music. I have to say, I use Linux since one year and have a lot to learn. I hope to 
>           use the Chumby with some other useful things so I can learn more about Linux.

> **Survey results**
> 
> The survey results are available as [pdf file](http://en.opensuse.org/images/3/3a/SurveySummary_03012010.pdf) and on the openSUSE Survey 
      2010 [wiki page](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Survey_2010) an extensive analysis has been made. The results have helped make project 
      decisions, be it technical, marketing or otherwise – and we call upon all openSUSE community members to keep using these numbers to back up their choices! We want to be 
      close to ourselves and the opinions of 27,000 users and contributors is nothing to be sneezed at.
> 
> We’d like to thank everyone who answered the questionnaire again for their time and efforts and wish the winners a lot of fun with their prizes and their future 
      endeavors in the world of Free Software! And as usual, if you’re looking into getting involved, you can simply contact anyone on IRC or mail – that includes me, your 
      humble writer. Find me on IRC [(freenode.net in the openSUSE channels like #opensuse-project)](http://webchat.freenode.net/) under the 
      nick jospoortvliet!

> At the end of the year it is the time for reviews and the openSUSE Booster Figure 2, “The elusive Thirsty Thirteen” team did not
          want to let that opportunity slip. So what was important in 2010 from an openSUSE Boosters
          perspective? What happened, what progress was made, how did the boosters help openSUSE? A
          report from Klaas Freitag.
> 
> **Who are the Boosters**
> 
> For those who do not know who [the Boosters](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Boosters_team) are: We’re not Tuxies favorite boy group, but a bunch of people
          dedicated to help the openSUSE Project in any way we can. The team consists of 13 people (BTW:
          widely known as the thirsty thirteen) with skills ranging from low level C hackery over Ruby
          on Rails mastering to Graphical Design or Project Management. Our team picks milestones and
          works on them in a agile fashion while always following our mantra: Grow community by enabling
          community. You can meet us at the usual places like IRC, the mailinglists or events were we
          show up and spread the word about openSUSE. We’re there to make contributors life easier and
          more fun, so if you have anything do not hesitate to talk to us. We’re here for you.
> 
> **Events in 2010**
> 
> So let’s quickly fly over the year of 2010 and see what was nice and important.
> 
>   * FOSDEM
> 
> Lets start with a very important event, FOSDEM in Brussels in February. We traveled
              there by coach the first time. That was remarkable because there were some push back
              against before (long journey) but we did it because it is cheaper, which means more people
              can go. The result was that we all were quite pleased by the coach trip as it was
              comfortable and fun, and finally not so much longer than the flight. And yes, consider how
              much carbon dioxide was saved? Since that trip I am constantly nagging for budget for an
              openSUSE Coach…
> 
> I held a talk about Hermes at FOSDEM which was, well, not a great success, that thing
              seems hard to market. That happens, others were more succesfull, like Christopher with his
              talk about image building with Kiwi. Michal had a meeting with MySQL packagers from all
              over the world at FOSDEM, which was probably the first real initiative to collaborate on
              cross distro topics. I also bought a GNOME T-Shirt, met tons of old friends, had cherry
              beer and got a cold as usual on FOSDEM.
> 
>   * Dev meeting
> 
> Also in February, we hosted a dev meeting of 25 KDE hackers here in the Nuremberg
              office. They worked on the highly rated plasma workspace for KDE 4.5. I still wonder how
              Will managed to get around with definitely no sleep for days.
> 
>   * Bento and wiki work
> 
> At home, at the beginning of the year we worked on projects called “Integrate all
              Infrastructure under one Umbrella” which resulted in the Bento web theme nowadays at all
              openSUSE sites use. It provides short ways from one site to another by thought through and
              pretty menus. Robert did a real great job with that and we got a lot of external
              recognition for it. At the same time the Wiki project started which was a huge project the
              Wiki community was pulling together with Henne and Tom. The decision was to create a new
              Wiki from scratch, implement reviewing features and transfer all relevant content into the
              new one while making sure to not transfer stuff nobody needs and maintains any more. That
              was a big thing and caused a lot of discussion. Today we can look back and say that we now
              have a well structured Wiki with valuable content. Fortune favors the bold :-)
> 
>   * OBS
> 
> In parallel to that, Coolo and Tom were contributing to the new BuildService [web interface](http://build.opensuse.org). After long working hours we
              finally came out with a great web interface for OBS which was a big bum for the whole
              project, as it makes working in OBS much more fun. I remember that whole thing being
              started as a sprint called “Factory status”, aiming to provide a good [overview
                page](https://build.opensuse.org/projectstatus?project=openSUSE%3AFactory) for the Factory project in OBS. It grew a bit more ambitions, but, well,
              that’s how it goes if things are in movement ;-)
> 
>   * LinuxTag
> 
> In June, there was LinuxTag in Berlin where most of us participated with talks in the
              free program or workshops on our booth. We educated a lot of people how to contribute to
              openSUSE in various ways. From submitting code fixes through the Build Service to creating
              great Geeko graphics with Inkscape to how to twist their own Geeko out of pipe
              cleaners.
> 
>   * openSUSE 11.3
> 
> In July, openSUSE 11.3 was released. That was lots of work beforehand with quite some
              boosters involvement, as Mr. Distro Coolo is part of the team. However not only he is
              contributing to the distribution, we all have our shares in it. 11.3 was a good one, it
              got good press and showed that we as a community are doing great. All over the world
              release parties were organized, some Boosters took over the one here in Nürnberg. [Nice party](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/07/16/opensuse-11-3-launch-party-in-nurnberg/) with some talks, along with BBQ and beer. The latter ran out at 7pm,
              because many community members showed up. Cool, I love that kind of stress to organize
              food and beer quickly to let the party go on :-)
> 
>   * GNOME and KDE conferences
> 
> Also in Summer, GUADEC as well as Akademy took place for our desktop Boosters. Vincent
              rocked GUADEC and gave away Geekos and stuff and advertised openSUSE as a good platform
              for the upcoming GNOME3. Will could not go to Akademy this year for a very good reason
              called Anna :-)
> 
>   * openSUSE conference
> 
> In autumn, the for me most exciting event of the year took place, the second [openSUSE Conference](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Conference). We were
              heavily involved in organizing, program committee work, giving talks and presentations and
              all what is involved with that kind of large event. It was a huge success, as a very
              active and passionate community showed up. Discussions went from a “This is what we did”
              in the last year to a “this is what we could do” which is so great to see as that is
              resulting in innovation for the whole project. As a result some very concrete sub projects
              were created such as “Project Brezn” and openSUSE Invis which slowly evolves.
> 
>   * openFATE, Connect and more
> 
> After the conference and the release of 11.3 we started to dig into milestones again
              with [openFATE](http://features.opensuse.org) and [Connect](http://connect.opensuse.org). Since a couple of weeks we have a
              nice looking openFATE that has the features that make it possible for the feature
              screening team to work on one of our most important tasks in our project: Looking into the
              future of the distribution with feature evaluation. We also implemented the future of the
              user/group handling for all the openSUSE services with a social twist: Connect. Our own
              instance of a social network that makes it possible to connect the people that make this
              project what it is and at the same time makes it possible to centralize the user
              data.
> 
> **Busy 2010**
> 
> So all in all the boosters had a very busy and prosperous year 2010. All of us carried
          their individual share of work in the various areas of the openSUSE project we participate in,
          be it in the openSUSE KDE and GNOME Teams, the openSUSE Distribution, the openSUSE tools or
          the openSUSE Board. We attended a lot of events and organized a couple of our own with great
          success. And we worked together on the most pressing milestones we saw for contributor growth
          in a fun and clever way. All in all we helped a lot of contributors to stand up, take
          responsibility and do get their hands dirty for the openSUSE Project. That makes us proud and
          we will do this smarter, faster, better and stronger in 2011. Promised!

> This has been one of the guidelines in my life for quite some time… It started as a curiosity a long time ago with Notify OSD and evolved to full project 
          in openSUSE. It is important to acknowledge at this point the motivation provided by the openSUSE GNOME Team from which I’ve been getting plenty of guidance and 
          help, namely from Vincent Untz (vuntz) and Dominique ﻿Leuenberger (Dimstar). Thanks to them, we have now a GNOME:Ayatana Project on OBS (openSUSE Build Service), 
          currently being populated with the support libraries for Ayatana’s Unity and Indicators.
> 
> Susan Linton has made a small article for Linux Journal about this project in the past. Though some people pointed to me that it was advertising and excelling 
          Ubuntu… I would like to leave a statement… We’re not taking a hike on Ubuntu visibility, and it isn’t bad at all, on the contrary… In fact it will help Ubuntu, us 
          and many others… specially if some Ubuntu patches are accepted faster by upstream. I hope other RPM distributions will follow the way we, openSUSE, proudly seem to 
          pioneering! From my personal point of view… a distribution “distributes”… and despite this software isn’t attractive for some openSUSE users, I’m happy 
          it is available (totally or partially) for all those who want to test it… Wait… you don’t even need to install Ubuntu or changing the platform you run!

        **
> 
> On the 6th of December, the openSUSE marketing team held the first of three Collaboration
          Days. The goal of these days was to get on IRC together and get some tasks done. Each day was
          organized by a team of two volunteers who build up a list of possible task which on the day
          itself were to be picked up by the attendees.
> 
> **Results**
> 
> Before talking about the material results, an important note: while indeed it was great to
          get so many things done, the most important was something else. Working together like this was
          fun. Really, the team spirit was great and everyone involved deserves a big kudos for simply
          being such a great person! During the 24 hours that the event took, some members were online
          for a much longer time than you could expect anyone to stay – true dedication! The meetings
          really showed what the spirit of Free Software and openSUSE means – making a difference
          together. Because we made a difference.
> 
> Among other things, the following things were accomplished:
> 
> **Documentation created and updated**: organizing booths and
          launch parties; Ambassador documentation; Talking points; example Letters of Sponsorship; and
          a general WIKI reorganization and cleanup.
> 
> **Totally new**: two short presentations, one about SUSE
          Studio and one on OBS; short descriptions of openSUSE to be used in marketing materials; a
          series of keywords associated to openSUSE for SEO usage; a photo gallery showing openSUSE
          related images;
> 
> We also made significant strides in the feature list for openSUSE 11.4, which we hope to
          turn into an informative and fun to read feature guide for the release! Based on the work on
          short descriptions of openSUSE and the latest state of our Strategy, two folders are now in
          development: one for potential openSUSE users and one for potential contributors. Anyone
          interested in helping out: please contact us!

> Moreover two short presentations on SUSE Studio and OBS were created which can be used in
          presentations from the Ambassadors. Already some Greek ambassadors are using them and they
          promised to contribute back translated versions.

> The next Testing Core Team IRC meeting will be held 2011-01-31 at 18:00 UTC and
          will discuss 11.4 M6.
> 
> Attendance at the December 27 meeting was optional. As many of the team were on
          holiday, only two were present. Neither of us had any particular problems with
          11.4 M5, thus we took some time to get to know each other. As we did not have a
          real meeting, the IRC log will not be posted.
> 
> The openSUSE forums have not had many complaints about M5, thus it appears to be
          shaping up quite well. In addition, the 2.6.37 kernel, which is used in 11.4,
          will have its release in roughly 1-2 weeks, thus there will be approximately 3
          months of kernel testing before 11.4 is released. That is good timing.

> FOSS.in day 2 continued.. yes I know after a long ten big days but I was too lazy to write a blog post, so  I will summarize things quite fast over here. The second 
        day was quite good as compared to the previous days and I attended a few workshops and was able to attend and somewhat understand a few of them like MariaDB and I 
        specially liked the talk by security in mobile devices by Tobias Mueller. Yes, and I was able to get all the openSUSE DVDs given to the Delegate Kids provided by 
        FOSS.in guys and so the DVDs were too less for us :-( . The 3rd day was the worst in terms of talks for me as I could not get into a lot of talks and missed a few 
        interesting talks. Also the mediawiki miniconf turned out to be more of a waste of time rather than fun, at least for me. An Hacker’s apology by tuxmaniac was just 
        awesome and the Raghu Dixit Project totally rocked :D . I immediately boarded the train to my home after FOSS.in

        thoroughly.  In the last few days I also played with the flickr api, and came up with a bunch of php based libraries. The best flickr api wrapper which I found was 
        [phpflickr](http://phpflickr.com/). The reasons being this guy has wonderfully wrapped all the functions of the flickr api. I played it around and used 
        Robert Lihm’s bento theme to make a photo gallery for openSUSE at my site.

> Yesterday a small team of the Greek openSUSE community decided to go on a Christmas roadtrip. We traveled about 2 and a half hours to go to the beautiful border 
        town of Florina. We were invited by teachers of The Educational Computer Association of Florina to help them promote FOSS. In the central square of the city they 
        hard wooden houses with different themes (you can see the pictures). openSUSE Greek team with KLUG and a very active elementary teacher, Mr Ioannis Kaskamanidis, 
        were informing people who was interested in what we do. Mr Kaskamanidis, brought his students with their XO laptops. Kids were showing their laptops with pride 
        and giving away info packs (PromoDVDs, stickers, brochures). We also met with a local doctor, Dr Evangelos Tsoukas. He translated and supports the Electronic 
        Medical Records program called openEMR.

      us to put all our equipment inside the wooden house. What is left from this event was:

      [Linux

    **
> 
> **Jon Masters talks about features in the 2.6.37 Linux kernel and
        describes debugging a kernel problem using the Git bisection feature… **
> 
> We’re now free of the Big Kernel Lock (in many configurations – it’s a config option that
      will hide other not-yet-compatible options when used) and I have been running systems BKL-free
      for some time now. Arnd Bergman and others have done an excellent job to rid us of this last
      vestige of truly ancient non-scalable Linux and unless you need a V4L (Video-4-Linux – TV
      tuner, webcam etc) device, you can probably run BKL-free today too. It is hoped that V4L will
      be fixed soon, maybe in time for 2.6.37. You probably won’t notice a huge performance benefit
      of running without the BKL unless you happen to have something more high end than a desktop,
      but it’s still pretty cool to know that you could get higher performance if only you could
      afford to have a system with dozens of CPUs to take advantage of it.
> 
> calability is great on the high end, but another more impressive feature for those working
      with more down-to-earth systems is (at last) near-complete support for running as a Xen ‘Dom0’
      (or host kernel) under the Xen hypervisor. For years, the support for Xen host kernels lived
      in patches separate from the mainline kernel and had to be added separately. This constrained
      which Xen kernels could be used and made life more difficult for those using it in their
      virtualisation setups. It’s not (yet) possible to fully run an official Linus kernel without
      any patches as a Dom0 host kernel, but the remaining extra driver pieces and other work should
      be complete in time for 2.6.38. This incidentally prompted some folks in the Fedora kernel
      community to wonder about scheduling. They would like this to land in Fedora 15 (for those who
      want to use Xen instead of hardware-based KVM virtualisation) but are unwilling to accept
      large patches for things not yet in the official kernel (especially given historical
      experiences with having to maintain large patches for Xen). Only time can tell what will
      happen there. (...)

      Many times we meet issues on how to mount partitions.

> 
> Apart from being a tasty Bavarian bread-snack, Bretzn is a code-name for a collection of
        technology aimed at solving a problem which has existed in software development for a very
        long time: How do you get your applications build for all available platforms and get it to
        your users?
> 
> In the open source community, we already have many individual bits of this dream in
        place. We the great cross platform toolkit Qt, we have the powerful openSuse Build Service
        which allows for the easy creation of binaries for a great number of Linux distributions, we
        have the Open Collaboration Services (OCS) which allows for the easy and socially adept
        distribution of packages both to and from central software download sites such as
        KDE-Apps.org, and we have a great many powerful integrated development enviromnents such as
        Qt Creator, KDevelop and Eclipse.
> 
> In the spring of 2010 these many powerful and successful technologies and tools made up
        mostly isolated islands, and it seemed the obvious choice to begin the process of bridging
        them. Finally, in August the same year, the project was begun and and announced during the
        openSUSE conference in October. Project Bretzn would make it possible, with a few clicks, to
        publish software projects directly from the IDE. The development of this project is
        sponsored by Nokia. (...)

> 
> There are often reports regarding concerns about computer games having negative effects
        on children and adults, with the fear that these games can lead to violent behaviour and
        addiction. However, studies by leading researchers have shown that there are many positive
        attributes to playing computer games, some of which we have alluded to in our earlier
        articles. Computer games can help players to improve their cognitive skills, enhance
        creativity, deepen language and maths skills, and help people to think on their feet and
        outside the box, the latter referring to novel, creative and smart thinking. However, above
        all these things, games offer pure, unadulterated fun.

> Linux is vastly underrated as a gaming platform. This may be due to the fact that there
        is no significant marketing of Linux games. With a lack of big-name games featuring in the
        computing press, coupled with a low market share for Linux on desktop PCs, things might seem
        bleak, with major barriers to the growth of Linux games.
