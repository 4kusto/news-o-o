The [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) community concluded its sixth [openSUSE.Asia Summit](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/summitasia19) this weekend at the [Fakultas Teknik](https://ft.unud.ac.id/) of the [Universitas Udayana](https://www.unud.ac.id/) in Bali, Indonesia.

Bali’s newest tourist attraction, the [Garuda Wisnu Kencana status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garuda_Wisnu_Kencana_statue), towered outside the window as participants discussed all things openSUSE and open source.

A number of participants traveled from all over the world to join students from the university. The students volunteered with running the summit and many made their first contributions to open source. Attendees from more than 20 nations attended the summit. Talks at the summit focused on open source technologies, community contributions, healthcare technologies like [GNU Health](https://www.gnuhealth.org), packaging, using the [Open Build Service](https://openbuildservice.org) and much more.
