Novell is once again sponsoring a Hack Week, from July 20 through July 24th. This is an opportunity for Novell's Open Platform Solutions developers to use their Innovation Time Off and hunker down and work on the projects that catch their fancy.

Hack Week projects can be new features, new applications, or improvements to existing services and applications. Previous Hack Weeks have generated projects like Tasque, Giver, Debian package support in the openSUSE Build Service, and many others. Hack Week is also a chance for Novell employees to work with the openSUSE Community contributors if they wish on projects that help improve openSUSE.

You don't have to be a Novell employee to participate! If you'd like to hack on something cool and useful, you're welcome to join in!

We'll be collecting ideas in openFATE for Hack Week, so if you'd like to contribute an idea, just go to [openFATE](http://features.opensuse.org/) and log in with your openSUSE account. Then select "Create" and add your feature, as well as any test or use cases.

If you'd like to help implement one of the ideas, check out the features that are already in openFATE for Hack Week IV. Go to "Browse" and select Hack Week IV as the Product, and you'll see all of the proposed features for Hack Week.

Have questions about Hack Week? Email [Olaf Kirch](mailto:okir@suse.de) or ask in [#opensuse-project](irc://freenode.net/opensuse-project) on Freenode.
