![](https://en.opensuse.org/images/4/43/Failgeeko.png)On 2013-03-05 we will do some maintenance on our public rsync server to increase the performance of the machine. During the maintenance a slower machine will take its place to keep the most of the services up.

The affected services are:



	
  * rsync.opensuse.org

	
  * tube.opensuse.org

	
  * torrent seeder


Only the first 2 of those will be running until we put the original machine back in place, which can take a few days.

With kind regards,
Your openSUSE admin team
