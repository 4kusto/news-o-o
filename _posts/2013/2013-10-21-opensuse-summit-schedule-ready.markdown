As you may well know, [Disney's Coronado Springs Resort](//summit.opensuse.org/#location) in beautiful Florida will welcome all Geekos to this year's openSUSE Summit from November 15 to 17. This will be a great event, if the brand new schedule is any indication! It has just been made public, together with information about our keynote speakers.<!-- more -->



## The keynotes


We are very excited to announce our keynote speaker for the keynote on Saturday. [Mykel Alvis](https://plus.google.com/117207740852943355900/posts) will speak to us about fostering better communication, a topic that is very important within openSUSE and any open source project. Mykel's current interest lie in IT automation and he has a plethora of experience in the enterprise and open source realms as developer and consultant. Mykel has spoken at many events, including this year's South East Linux Fest and Puppet Camp.

## The schedule


Thanks to those interested in sharing their knowledge we were able to compile a great schedule with presentations and workshops. The presentation and workshop schedule is now posted on the [openSUSE Summit web site](//summit.opensuse.org/#program). There will be systemd and image building workshops, talks about technical subjects like virtualization or building scalable web apps to more social subjects like marketing and advocacy.

We will also have a fun game or two going on during the summit, and don't forget if you [purchase a ticket](https://buy.suse.com/store/suse/en_US/buy/productID.264835100) in support of the event ([registration](https://conference.opensuse.org/osem/conference/summit13/register) and attendance is free, of course) you will receive a very nice backpack as welcome gift.
