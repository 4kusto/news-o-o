From Sep 12 to Sep 13 we will have a power outage in the Nuernberg office.

Downtime is planned from [2009-09-11 20:00 CEST](http://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_UTC.aspx?y=2009&mo=9&d=11&h=13&mn=00) (18:00 UTC) until [2009-09-14 10:00 CEST](http://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_UTC.aspx?y=2009&mo=09&d=14&h=7&mn=00) (08:00 UTC). So it might become a long weekend especially for developers - but we plan to avoid restrictions for endusers during this downtime.

So far, the following services are affected by this downtime:



	
  * Build Service

	
  * Mailing lists

	
  * ...and more


Please have a look at the ["downtime" wiki page](http://en.opensuse.org/Downtime/2009-09-11) to see the full list of affected hosts.

**Not** affected:



	
  * news.opensuse.org

	
  * <lang>.opensuse.org (all opensuse wikis)

	
  * forums.opensuse.org

	
  * irc.freenode.net/opensuse* channels

	
  * bugzilla.novell.com

	
  * download.opensuse.org (replacement host in place)

	
  * static.opensuse.org (replacement host in place)

	
  * software.opensuse.org (search will not work as the buildservice is down)


We plan no replacement for the other services as the downtime is not too large.

We will try to reduce/disable building on build.opensuse.org on Thursday, so all [mirrors](http://en.opensuse.org/Mirrors) should have "up-to date" packages over the weekend.

With kind regards,
Lars (on behalf of the openSUSE-Admins)
