Petr Mladek [has announced](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse/2007-08/msg00895.html) three openSUSE Build Service projects for SUSE Linux 10.1 to openSUSE 10.3 and SLED 10 which obsolete the older OpenOffice.org project: [OpenOffice.org:STABLE](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/OpenOffice.org:/STABLE/) from now on provides the latest stable version (currently 2.2.1); [OpenOffice.org:UNSTABLE](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/OpenOffice.org:/UNSTABLE/) provides packages of the latest preview of OpenOffice 2.3 built from the same sources as Factory; [OpenOffice.org:EXTRAS](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/OpenOffice.org:/EXTRAS/) provides some extras like dictionaries and templates to be used with both other repositories. He is also looking for co-maintainers to keep the stuff up to date and to improve it.
