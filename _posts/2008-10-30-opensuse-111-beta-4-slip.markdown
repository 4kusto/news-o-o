Just a quick note. The 11.1 release is slipping by at least one day [due to a few major problems](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2008-10/msg00779.html) with the DVDs found during testing.

Specifically:



	
  * The network is broken during second-stage installation

	
  * No update repos are registered


There are some further problems with missing branding for GNOME, the slideshow and release notes don't display, and some bugs that we hope will be ironed out shortly.

We are still aiming to release beta 4 this week, and will be providing further updates as events warrant.

While we don't like to slip the schedule, we still consider it important to release betas in a condition that allows significant testing. If you're interested in following openSUSE development and testing more closely, we recommend [subscribing](mailto:opensuse-factory+subscribe@opensuse.org) to the [openSUSE Factory](http://en.opensuse.org/Communicate/Mailinglists) mailing list. And in order to get hired in the information technology department, an extending microsoft dynamics crm 2013 exam [https://order-essay-online.net](https://order-essay-online.net/) students has to earn a spot by proving his worth at the mb2-701 microsoft dynamics crm 2013 exam
