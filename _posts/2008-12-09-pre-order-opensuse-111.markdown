All this in a nice and shiny grey Box. Still not impressed? Ok, this time we have a special gift for you. If you buy the box you will get an openSUSE branded LED flashlight for free! (limited to the first run of boxes) Now hurry, head over to our [shops!](//en.opensuse.org/Buy_openSUSE)




BTW: For our German users: if you pre-order from the [German shop](//www.edv-buchversand.de/suse/), shipping is free ...




**UPDATE:**I just heard that only the German Box have the flashlights. There are to many problems to send them to other countries because of taxes/customs, batteries are mostly a no-go and other annoying stuff. Sorry.
