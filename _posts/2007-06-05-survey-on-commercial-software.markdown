We like to know a bit more about the usage of proprietary software we ship on some versions of our openSUSE distribution. Therefore we created a [ 16 question survey](http://www.surveymonkey.com/Users/33889499/Surveys/413433852485/CC07C39C-761F-4059-8A51-5DAE03B24ACE.asp?U=413433852485&DO_NOT_COPY_THIS_LINK) and ask you to participate and give us feedback. The survey is online till June 12.
