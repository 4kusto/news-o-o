![Diagram without qa obs sle]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Diagram-without-qa-obs-sle.png)Gravitational waves might be the cause of two new live image, spin off projects released today by members of the[ openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) community.

The release of Argon, which is a live installable image based on openSUSE [Leap](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:42.1), and Krypton, which is a live installable image based on openSUSE [Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed), offer packages built for KDE Git using stable and tested openSUSE technologies to track the latest development state of KDE software.

Users have a choice on how they get up-to-date packages of [Qt](http://www.qt.io/) and other additional cutting-edge offerings from [KDE](https://www.kde.org/) through the [Argon](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/KDE:/Medias/images/iso/) and [Krypton](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/KDE:/Medias/images/iso/) live installable images, built directly from the latest sources in KDE git through the [Open Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/).

Argon and Krypton can be either used as live images, without changing an already installed system, or they can be installed, providing a full-stack KDE software environment.

This will allow developers, early testers and enthusiast adopters to experience the latest happenings in KDE software development, while at the same time being able to report bugs and improve the software before a stable release lands.

openSUSEâ€™s [Argon and Krypton](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/KDE:/Medias/images/iso/) become the first to offer a continuous stream of KDE software updates by putting the Git builds in the hands of users the way KDE intends it.

openSUSE has an extensive experience in providing almost-daily Git snapshots of KDE software: the Unstable OBS repositories have been running without issues for several years.

Thanks to this expertise, creating Argon and Krypton from Git snapshot is a rather simple endeavor, facilitated by the infrastructure provided by the openSUSE Project.

There are three KDE repositories used for Argon and Krypton, which can be found on the [Wiki](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:KDE_repositories). They are:

KDE:Unstable:Frameworks

KDE:Unstable:Applications

KDE:Unstable:Extra.

Packages are directly based on the Git repositories and not on any alpha, beta tarballs. These packages are refreshed at least daily.

The below build numbers will change based on rebuilds.

#### GNOME Next


[GNOME](https://wiki.gnome.org/RoadMap) - Next, which is similar but different than Argon and Krypton, is based on tarballs. GNOME - Next is from the unstable branch of GNOME, currently 3.19.x, but will soon be 3.21.x. For that repo to work, occasionally it reaches beyond GNOME packages with libinput and various hardware libraries to build.
