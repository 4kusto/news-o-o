![Tumbleweed-black]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Tumbleweed-black-300x127.png)The last update provided on [Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) was almost a month ago and a lot has happened since then.

Besides the release of a an Alpha 2 for [openSUSE Leap 42.2](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:42.2) and the five-day openSUSE Conference in Nuremberg, Tumbleweed snapshots have been rolling along with 10 snapshots since the last update, which highlighted the addition of [GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/) 6 as the default compiler for Tumbleweed.

The latest snapshot, [20160710](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-07/msg00168.html), brought a major release for python3-setuptools to version 24.0.2. [Systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) also added some subpackages and python3-numpy squashed some bugs.

Recent snapshots brought [LibreOffice 5.2](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleaseNotes/5.2), [Mesa 12.0](http://www.mesa3d.org/), [Kernel 4.6.3](https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.6.3) and [PulseAudio 9](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Notes/9.0/) to Tumbleweed.

Plans for future snapshots have Freetype 2.6.5, disabling a new subpixel hinting mode that was added to version 2.6.4, but it shouldnâ€™t be long for that option to be re-enabled in a future Tumbleweed snapshot.

As for [Plasma 5.7.0](https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.7.0.php), the version is still in staging and needs some bug fixes before it will be released.

The planned release in November of the next openSUSE Leap version will have [GNOME 3.20](https://www.gnome.org/news/2016/03/gnome-3-20-released/), [Plasma 5.6.4](https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.6.4.php) and [KDE Framework 5.23](https://www.kde.org/announcements/kde-frameworks-5.23.0.php). The Linux Kernel will be [4.4](https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_4.4).
