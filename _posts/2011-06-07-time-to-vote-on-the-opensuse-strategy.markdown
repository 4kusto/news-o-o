Over the last year an openSUSE strategy discussion has been ongoing. Beginning this year things went quiet for a while as everyone was busy with the openSUSE 11.4 release and now the conference but we're at the final stage and want to finish this. Time to vote!



## Forward


The openSUSE board has reviewed the text and after fixing one or two typo's and updating it to the latest state of affairs, they have asked Thomas Thym from the strategy team to start a vote among [openSUSE Membership](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Members). So every [Member](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Members) can go to [connect](http://bit.ly/kZaAC2) and vote on the proposal!<!-- more -->

We're not asking everyone if they think it is a perfect fit for themselves - we're a diverse community and we'll never fully agree on anything. But this proposal has seen lots of [thought](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Strategy), [discussion](http://lwn.net/Articles/392467/), [revision](https://lite.co-ment.com/text/lNPCgzeGHdV/view/), [input](https://news.opensuse.org/2010/10/07/opensuse-strategy-the-third-and-fourth-part-of-the-trilogy/) - it is arguably the best we could come up with to describe who we are and where we want to go. So the question is -  do we agree this describes us? Is it good enough for us to support? Can we move on with this?



## Results


You can find the result of our one-and-a-half year discussion on the [openSUSE Strategy wiki page](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Strategy). Note that the [Community Statement](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Strategy_Community_Statement) is an integral part of it.

This is the start of our Strategy document, describing our _mission_:


<blockquote>The openSUSE project is a worldwide effort that promotes the use of Linux everywhere. The openSUSE community develops and maintains a packaging and distribution infrastructure which provides the foundation for the world's most flexible and powerful Linux distribution. Our community works together in an open, transparent and friendly manner as part of the global Free and Open Source Software community. </blockquote>


So, if you're an openSUSE Member, it is time to [read the document one more time](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Strategy) and [cast your vote](http://bit.ly/kZaAC2)!

Note that the voting page is only accessible to logged in openSUSE Members and the results are hidden until June 30th.
