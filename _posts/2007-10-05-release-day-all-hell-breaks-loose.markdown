Yesterday we released openSUSE 10.3, and we are pretty impressed what happened.

Some rough numbers:

Our download for the iso images peaked at 14Gbit/s, the average was 12Gbit/s. This is without the mirror servers, this is just the download from Novell!

Our wiki had a load of 99 but was still responsive. The admin team in Provo added another server with load balancing, thanks for that! We had over 1000 request per second, after the new server kicked in the load was going down to 30 :-). 

Thanks to everybody who helped with this release, i want to mention a few people: the admin team in provo, Frank who fixed the download page, Francis for the announcement and all mirror servers. When you thoroughly understand the regulations of your field, you will have a better idea [https://homework-writer.com](https://homework-writer.com/) of how you can use or alter them to improve it
