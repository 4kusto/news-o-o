Following the recent participation by our team at FOSDEM we would also like to continue in the tradition of showing our team's outreach to different audiences. Over the past couple of years we have also asked a small part of our team to participate in the popular SCALE (Souther California Linux Expo) taking place on **Feb. 21-23, 2014**, at the Hilton Los Angeles Airport hotel. SCALE is the first Linux event in the US every year, therefore, they feature over 100 exhibitors and the attendance to the event is quite high. For this reason we will be reporting on each day at the conference.

Our openSUSE team decided to pack bags early on and set up the openSUSE Booth for this year. Just so they can also represent their own local community they also created a banner with a special Southern California twist.

We arrived at 9am and did not leave until nearly 11:00pm! Our rather large team of 9 and counting led by Drew Adams., Daniel Hodges, and Roger Luedecke had a blast bonding and working together as a team to set up the booth. We began with a team meeting to discuss how we want to do things and to delegate tasks. Each person has a job to do and each one is passionate about the responsibility they hold. The KDE team has been coordinating with Drew for the last few weeks and we agreed to combine forces and loan some of our man power and enthusiasm to their booth which is next door to ours. So not only are we participating in representation of openSUSE but now we have a beloved KDE team also join us.

To make things more interesting and draw a bigger crowd we will be raffling off the following prizes:



	
  * Grand Prize: Complete Rasberry Pi Starter kit, openSUSE Shirt, openSUSE Aluminum Drinking Vessel, and a copy of the book, “SUSE Linux Toolbox” (My goodness! If I wasn't part of the booth I would have put my own name down.)

	
  * 2nd – 5th place: copy of “SUSE Linux Toolbox”, openSUSE Aluminum Drinking Vessel, and openSUSE Shirt (Sizes: S – XXL while supplies lasts)


And to also raise some funds for the team and local communities we will be selling the following:

	
  * T-Shirts

	
  * Aluminum Drinking Vessel


The big drawing will be held on Sunday at 3:00pm (15:00) and the winner announced on Twitter @SoCalSUSE (winner does not have to be present to claim prizes. We will ship within the U.S.)

Andrew Heintz attended the LPI cram exam course which is a prep course for the LPI exam that will be administered on Sunday. The course was 4 hours long and according to Andrew, “It was a good primer for the test, and got us prepared for what the test is going to be like.”

To catch everyone's eyes to our booth we will be posing shirtless on a cube... Just kidding... We will just set up demos of the following:

	
  * Gaming capabilities and Steam

	
  * Open Build Service

	
  * openSUSE 13.1 Install

	
  * SUSE Studio

	
  * SUSE Cloud presented by Peter Lennell, Sales Engineer for m SUSE


And for your viewing pleasure some pics for you!
