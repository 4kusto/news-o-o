"The early bird gets the worm" That was the theme of our awakening at 5AM this morning. We arose to 22 notifications of retweets by new followers we made at the conference. We started a campaign today to acquire new followers by including a simple note with our Twitter handle @SoCalSUSE with our install discs. After a quick setup, the team started pitching openSUSE to a vast number of attendees roaming the show floor. We demoed “What does the chameleon say?” [//www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNkDJk5_9eU](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNkDJk5_9eU) . Our mascot, Romy Meyerson dressed as the chameleon and explored the convention while giving out stickers and yo-yos as well as the newest release in exchange for hugs. ![1970495_10153830820100417_1147112629_n](//news.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1970495_10153830820100417_1147112629_n.jpg)

Back at the booth, undressing efforts and distribution of the install discs were very successful. A handful of the team attended a few talks and enjoyed the lectures. Ron Collins, Zeak Dreger, Andrew Heintz, and Chris Adams attended “Magical System Admin Incantations For New Freedom Fighters” by George Robinson. When asked about the class Zeak Dreger said, “I really liked learning the old way of doing things and how it relates the new way of doing things when it comes to the basic command line.” Daniel Hodges attended “Raspberry Pi Hacks” by Ruth Suehle. When asked about the talk he said, “What made me have to come to this class is the tag line in the description what hack upgraded a girlfriend wife. Turns out the hack was a functional R2D2 powered by Raspberry Pi. I want. I want. I want.” Drew Adams attended Automated deployment Django Docker and Salt by Roberto Aguilar. “It was good given the short amount of time we had.”

At the end of the night, Tony Su did a fantastic job organizing a last minute openSUSE BoF talk. The day went exceptionally well on all fronts. Tomorrow should be an exciting conclusion to SCaLE 12x 2014. Don't forget our raffle for the Raspberry pi is being held at 3pm on Sunday afternoon.
