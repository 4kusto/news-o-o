The news writer from SUSE office snuck into the openSUSE Asia's trello board and found that they will use an open source voting tool for their upcoming [![halp](/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/halp.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/halp.jpg)events. Snoek is a voting tool developed during the SUSE Hackweek by Beijing R&D Team, SUSE. Snoek is written in Django and is eagerly seeking out more django developers to add more features to it like OpenID support and richer (picture, link) voting item support.

Source code of snoek can be found at : [https://github.com/yifanjiang/snoek](https://github.com/yifanjiang/snoek)
and Yifan has also written a nice [https://github.com/yifanjiang/snoek/blob/master/README](https://github.com/yifanjiang/snoek/blob/master/README) to get you started.

All that is required is a little django and python knowledge from a fellow Geeko.

As a big "Thank you" for your efforts, the developer will also receive a free tee shirt shipped to his place.
