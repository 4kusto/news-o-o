Hi all,




It’s with some regret that we have to announce that **Vincent Untz**, our current openSUSE Board Chairman, has chosen to step down as a result of a happy personal event that will take up a lot of his spare time in the months (and years!) to come.




We as the board would like to thank Vincent for his contributions to the project and the board over many years and hope that he will continue to be part of our Project, just in a different capacity, for a long time yet.




<!-- more -->




As we know the chairman of the board is an appointed position. SUSE as the primary sponsor of our project has come to the conclusion that **Richard Brown**, one of our current Board members, should be the new Chairman, effective from today. Congratulations Richard!




With the change in role for Richard his elected Board seat becomes vacant. We are discussing various options to fill the seat for the remaining 5 months until the next election, please stay tuned for an announcement in the next couple of weeks.




Your openSUSE Board
