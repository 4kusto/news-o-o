[![Together](/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Hans1.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Hans1.jpg)

Before the dawn of 2015 and as [announced at oSC14](//youtu.be/N_vc4Ymks8k?list=PL_AMhvchzBaexmeFXo2zfjQTV0XxaMliS)  work has already started for yet another **awesome openSUSE Conference**. For 2015 the city of **The Hague** in the**Netherlands** will host our Annual Conference. This year the openSUSE community is gearing up and is ready to accept people from everywhere to a 4 day conference where there will be a lot of _Learning and Hacking and Partying_. The organizing team needs **YOUR HELP** to make this happen. So starting today you can [**sign up**](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC15) to [join forces](https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/osc15)![![Hans2](/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Hans2.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Hans2.jpg)

**Whatever your skill level** you are welcome to participate. We are looking for people willing to help out with **A/V, Design, Networking, Promotion, Software**, finding **Speakers** and helping out with the **Venue** itself. Join us for an awesome ride, with a fantastic destination. **Make it your own event**!

We use the openSUSE progresstracker in this project to keep track of the tasks. The documents are used to suggest announcements. Every two weeks we have project meetings on the opensuse-project channel on freenode.

Anyone is welcome to participate! To do so:

    
    Sign up for an openSUSE account and sign into this tool
    Assign an existing issue to yourself or create an issue with a task
    


If you need help with this tool (Redmine) have a look at the [user guide](//www.redmine.org/guide#User-guide) .
