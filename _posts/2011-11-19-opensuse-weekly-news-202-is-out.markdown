        [openSUSE 12.1: All Green!](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/11/16/opensuse-12-1-all-green/)
      

It is November 16, 2011 and our mirrors have synced. Time to present to you: openSUSE
        12.1! This release represents more than eight months of work by our international community
        and brings you the best Free Software has to offer. Awesome improvements include the latest
        GNOME 3.2 desktop as well as the newest from KDE, XFCE and LXDE; your ownCloud made easy
        with mirall; Snapper-shots of your file system; and much, much more. (...)

Congratulations to everyone who has worked hard on openSUSE 12.1 for another successful
        release. Can't wait to get it running.

In the meantime, spread the word!

Stories are
        appearing on [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/submission/1851340/opensuse-121-released) and [HackerNews](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3243673). Upvote, comment, discuss! Suggest to the websites and

        [Martin Schlander: openSUSE 12.1 released](http://mschlander.wordpress.com/2011/11/16/opensuse-12-1-released/)
      

You can read about all the goodies in the [product highlights](http://en.opensuse.org/Product_highlights) and [download it](http://software.opensuse.org/).

As always there are some pain points you should be aware of too:

  * KDEPIM (Kontact, KMail, KOrganizer etc.) of KDE SC 4.7 is now fully ported to
              using Akonadi and you should expect some problems and probably do some testing before
              you upgrade/migrate your production machines.

  * Touchpad tapping is disabled by default. To enable it, make sure synaptiks is
              installed and go to systemsettings => Input Devices => Touchpad and enable
              tapping.

  * The new default init system systemd might cause you some grief.

  * Sun/Oracle Java is no longer included in the distro because of a license change.
              If OpenJDK is not working for you, you’ll have to get Oracle Java from
              Oracle.com.

        [Andreas Jaeger: What has changed since RC2 in openSUSE 12.1?](http://jaegerandi.blogspot.com/2011/11/just-three-more-days-until-release-of.html)
      

Just three more days until the release of openSUSE 12.1. Last Friday, 11th of November,
        Coolo declared 12.1 as golden and the openSUSE community is now busy pushing out everything to
        the mirros and reworking the openSUSE web pages for the launch. If you like more information
        about openSUSE 12.1, check the [openSUSE 12.1 Portal](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:12.1).

Since the release of RC2 quite a number of bugs have been fixed. During the
        RC phase and especially after the last RC, Coolo pushes for bugs that cannot be fixed with an
        online update, thus bugs that break initial installation, installed defaults and the update
        applets. (...)

        [The Register/Iain Thomson: New openSUSE heads for cloud, virtual markets](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/11/17/opensuse_cloud_virtual/)
      

The openSUSE Project has shipped its [12.1 build](http://software.opensuse.org/121/en), with enhanced cloud and virtualization integration tools. It's also
        the first distro to ship with support for Google’s Go language.

From the look of the new build, Attachmate has kept [its promise](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/11/23/attachmate_opensuse_safe/) to carry on supporting openSUSE after its [$2.2bn deal to buy Novell](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/04/28/farewell_novell/). The new code, in line with [the beta El Reg examined last month](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/10/17/opensuse_12_point_1_review/), is built around
        kernel 3.1 and contains the latest software, including Firefox 7, Thunderbird 7, LibreOffice
        3.4.3, and GIMP. (...)

And another popular Linux distribution pushes a new release out the door. This time
        around, it's openSUSE, as they [just released version 12.1](http://en.opensuse.org/Product_highlights). Other than the usual latest and greatest version of all the
        open source desktops and associated tools, there's a few other interesting tidbits in this

Following two release candidates and [a slight delay](http://www.h-online.com/news/item/openSUSE-12-1-running-late-1362984.html), the [openSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org/en/) project has
        published version 12.1 of its Linux distribution. The major update to the openSUSE operating
        system introduces a number of platform changes and new features. Based on the [3.1 Linux kernel](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/What-s-new-in-Linux-3-1-1347364.html), openSUSE 12.1 offers a choice of the [GNOME 3.2](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/First-Look-GNOME-3-2-1350917.html) or the [KDE 4.7](http://www.h-online.com/news/item/KDE-SC-4-7-released-1286972.html)
        desktop environments and is the first distribution to ship with [colour management](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_management) tools for
        both. Users looking for a minimal, lightweight desktop can alternatively select from either
        Xfce or LXDE desktops which, according to the developers, haven't seen any major feature
        updates since the last openSUSE release. (...)

The OpenSUSE project released OpenSUSE 12.1, featuring Linux 3.1, GNOME 3.2, KDE 4.7,
        plus support for KDE's "OwnCloud" cloud platform. OpenSUSE 12.1 introduces the SystemD
        configuration utility and Google's Go programming language, and integrates a Btrfs-based
        "Snapper" tool for rolling back system updates and configuration changes.The first [
          beta of OpenSUSE 12.1
        ](http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS5890234816.html) was released in early October, revealing the
        distro's switch to GNOME 3.2. The desktop upgrades GNOME 3.0, which shipped as a preview
        version in [

        the long-time GNOME desktop competitor KDE 4.7, as well as Xfce and LXDE. The distro is
        touted for being the "first major Linux distribution" to ship both GNOME and KDE with color
        management tools. (...)

The openSUSE Project has released openSUSE 12.1, eight months after 11.4 and the first release since SUSE officially became a subsidiary of Attachmate. With 12.1, openSUSE brings major improvements to openSUSE tools and users' favorite components like GNOME, KDE, LibreOffice, and DigiKam. (...)

When [Novell was bought by Attachmate](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/novell-deals-done/8755), people [wondered if Novell/SUSE’s community Linux distribution, openSUSE, would even survive](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/where-novell-suse-linux-goes-from-here/8951). Now, we know, [openSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org/en) lives.

The openSUSE Project has released the [latest version of its popular Linux distribution openSUSE 12.1](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/11/16/opensuse-12-1-all-green). In a statement, Jos Poortvliet, openSUSE community manager for [SUSE](http://www.suse.com/), said, “OpenSUSE 12.1 represents more than eight months of worldwide effort to create one of the industry’s best Linux distributions. The openSUSE distribution and its thousands of open source applications are the result of contributions from individual testers, writers, translators, usability experts, artists, ambassadors, packagers and developers having a lot of fun working together to create a uniquely powerful set of tools and capabilities.”

So what does that mean? Well, among other things even more so than [Ubuntu](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/ubuntu-linux-heads-to-the-clouds/9722), openSUSE is embracing the cloud. (...)

        [Network World/Julie Bort: OpenSUSE 12.1 bulks up on features for cloud, servers, desktops](http://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/new-opensuse-adds-features-for-cloud-servers-desktops)
      

The OpenSUSE project has released its next stable version, a.k.a [OpenSUSE 12.1](http://en.opensuse.org/12.1). It includes the Linux kernel 3.1, tons of enhancements for use with public and private clouds and the cool new Tumbleweed tool, a project conceived by SUSE kernel engineer Greg Kroah-Hartman.

openSUSE includes a feature called "ownCloud," which is a filesharing alternative to services like DropBox. ownCloud has two downsides: it takes some skills to implement it and it doesn't keep the files persistently on your computer to access them offline. openSUSE solves that with its new mirall tool which eases deployment of ownCloud and creates a local folder in which it synchronized local and cloud files.

        [TechCrunch/Scott Merrill: openSUSE 12.1 Released](http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/16/opensuse-12-1-released/)
      

[openSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org/en/), the community developed Linux distribution sponsored by SUSE, has released version 12.1 today. At first glance, openSUSE 12.1 is pretty much in line with recent releases from Fedora and Ubuntu: GNOME 3.2, [systemd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd), etc. But a closer look starts to reveal some real divergence between the various Linux offerings today. For example, while Fedora 16 allows you to choose [btrfs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs) for your filesystem, openSUSE 12.1 uses btrfs by default. There’s a number of other interesting advancements packed in this release, too. (...)

The openSUSE Linux distribution is out with a new release today, providing users with new desktop, cloud and backup features.

One of the key new features in the openSUSE 12.1 release is the Snapper tool that helps users to take full advantage of the Btrfs filesystem.

"Btrfs adds the ability to do rollbacks on file changes," openSUSE Board Chairman, Alan Clark told InternetNews.com. "So if someone accidentally deletes a file, I can use Snapper to rollback and recover that file." (...)

        [Muktware/Neil Richards: openSuse 12.1 Released, Comes With OwnCloud](http://www.muktware.com/bitsnbytes/2956)
      

The openSuse team has announced the release of version 12.1.  I have been playing with the RC for a while and found it exremely stable. We are working on a review of openSuse 12.1 and will be publishing it soon. Keep an eye on our Google Plus page for the review.

openSUSE 12.1 comes with the new GNOME Shell 3.2. Notifications are much nicer, you can now configure your online accounts in one place and Shell handles multiple-screen setups better. Among the features is color management, something GNOME shares with KDE where openSUSE is the first to integrate the Oyranos color management system. Also new from KDE is Apper, an easier-to-use PackageKit front end. (...)

**The OpenSUSE project released version 12.1 of its enterprise-focused Linux distribution, featuring Linux 3.1, GNOME 3.2 and support for KDE's "OwnCloud" cloud platform. OpenSUSE 12.1 introduces the SystemD configuration utility and Google's Go programming language, and further integrates the Btrfs file-system with a "Snapper" tool for rolling back system updates and configuration changes.**

A bare-bones [beta of OpenSUSE 12.1](http://www.linuxfordevices.com/c/a/News/Fedora-16-beta-and-OpenSUSE-121-beta/) was released in early October, with the primary purpose of giving OpenSUSE developers a chance to get better acquainted with GNOME 3.2. According to the community project -- which is closely backed by [Attachmate and its new SUSE](http://www.linuxfordevices.com/c/a/News/SUSE-and-Xamarin-announce-broad-Mono-partnership/) (formerly Novell) business unit as an upstream contributor to SUSE Linux -- GNOME 3.2 is a major improvement over the controversial GNOME 3.0.

        [Muktware/Swapnil Bhartiya: openSuse 12.1 Review: An Elite OS](http://www.muktware.com/articles/2962)
      

This is the favorite time of the year, it's like Christmas for a GNU/Linux user. This is the time of the year when most Linux distros release their latest versions. We have already played with Ubuntu 11.10, Fedora 16 and today openSUSE 12.1 arrived. I have been casually using openSUSE 12.1 (RC) for a while and am quite comfortable with it -- a compliment as its coming from a long-time Ubuntu user. If I look at my pattern I have been switching between Ubuntu 11.10, Fedora 16 and openSUSE 12.1 quite a lot recently. My Google + page is full of my experiences with these three OSes.

I never was an openSUSE user. I completely shifted to Linux at the same time when Novell signed that infamous deal with Microsoft which tried to 'validate' Windows maker's base-less and false claims that Linux infringes upon its patents. I distanced myself from openSUSE after that deal. Now, with Novell gone and Microsoft shifting focus to Android (Barnes & Nobel just exposed that Microsoft's Android claims were bogus) openSUSE appears to be back as the community driven project, and I am back too.

          [Wolfgang Rosenauer: Evergreen project status update](http://www.rosenauer.org/blog/2011/04/17/evergreen-status-after-some-months/)
        

I guess it’s time for another [Evergreen](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen) status update.

I cannot tell much about 11.2 (but as far as I can see Stefan does an awesome job in
          maintaining it) but will share my thoughts about the 11.1 flavour of Evergreen.

When I started that project it was clearly an experiment as I haven’t had an idea how
          much work it would be and if people would use it or even help with it. Looking back at
          what we’ve created it finally is more than I expected. Compared to what I announced in the
          beginning it was almost possible to maintain every part of the distribution and not only
          server packages. There are things which turned out be quite hard (e.g. kernel) but overall
          most issues were covered for 11.1. I think what I was able to prove is that it’s possible
          to somehow maintain a distributioný with very few manpower. (...)

An easy way to remove Software! For example: you installed an application with "1-click install" (which will install all the packages that you need), there should be an easy way (also with 1 click) to remove what you have installed with that 1-click operation... in another words: an "1-click Uninstall" to remove installed software (dependencies and packages included).

Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn't
            going to go away. The code itself isn't well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It's only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don't have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

We need a feedback about packages that are preferred by users and actively used. Debian already has a tool named Popularity contest (popcon)
            
          

* reusing popcon will give us results that are directly comparable with Debian and Ubuntu
          

* packagers team can take care of the package
          

* we need a configuration dialog in YaST that is visible enough
          

* we need a server infrastructure on opensuse.org. (There are certain privacy issues, see Debian FAQ for details)

            [Use YaST Theme](https://features.opensuse.org/312970)
          

The theme used in YaST with the buttons and background is quite aesthetically pleasing for configuration and installation. However, the upstream Oxygen theme doesn't look really pleasing (in fact I personally believe it resembles KDE 2's theme more than anything). The YaST theme should be expanded to work in KDE and to replace Oxygen (though Oxygen can remain an option)

            [zypper update license handling](https://features.opensuse.org/312972)
          

With every flashplayer or java update "zypper up" asks to confirm the license agreement over and over again. It would be nice if the license needs confirmation ONLY if it has changed since the last "Agreed" action. Making the "-l" option default is not a very good idea since sometimes the license may change in an unpredictable way, but if it's unchanged it gets really annoying.

            [Add Ext4 LVM snapshot support to Snapper](https://features.opensuse.org/312974)
          

Very simple. The way Snapper can work on Btrfs, enable it to work that way with the backup snapshots of Ext4 filesystems using Logical Volume Management.

            [Install kernel-desktop from Live CD (GNOME and KDE)](https://features.opensuse.org/312993)
          

Hello, actually OpenSUSE 11.4, and 12.1 install kernel-desktop from the standard DVD installer, at least if user choose to install a graphical desktop environment such KDE or GNOME. But I have found that Live CDs (GNOME and KDE) install kernel-default, this haven't got much sense for me. I think Live GNOME and Live KDE mediums should also install kernel-desktop by default instead of kernel-default.

      [Linus Torvalds: Linux 3.2-rc2](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1215747)
    

Linux 3.2-rc2 is out there now. Well, the git trees are there
(kernel.org and github), and the tar-file should be all done, but the
patch is still uploading.

One thng worth noting: I got the new release scripts right, so now the
-rc2 files are found in their proper location under "v3.x/testing",
unlike -rc1 that got put directly in "v3.x". I'll fix the -rc1
location when I'm somewhere with better network.

And for being an -rc2 release of a pretty large merge-window, it seems
to be quite reasonably sized. In fact, despite this having been the
largest linux-next in a release in our linux-next history (I think),
rc2 has the exact same number of commits since rc1 as we had during
the 3.1 release.

About half the changes are architecture fixups (m68k and arm, with
some powerpc and a smattering of others) Of the rest, about half is
drivers (much of it drm), and the rest is "filesystems and sundry
updates".

The shortlog is appended for people who enjoy that level of detail. (...)

**The TCP stack is now faster at adapting the data transmission rate to the available line capacity. The drivers for Wi-Fi components by Atheros and Broadcom have matured considerably; other drivers will support more LAN and Wi-Fi hardware in 3.2 than they did before.**

No major changes have been integrated into the main development branch of Linux since the
        [first release candidate](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Linux-3-2-main-development-phase-complete-1375016.html) of Linuxý3.2 became available, closing this version's merge
      window. Linus Torvalds will probably soon release the second RC of this kernel version, the
      final release of which is expected to become available in mid to late January; until then,
      Torvalds will mainly incorporate fixes and small, harmless improvements as he has done in the
      past few days.

The Kernel Log is now in a position to provide a comprehensive overview of the most
      important new features of Linux 3.2. As usual, this information will be presented within the
      "Coming in 3.2" series of articles that will gradually cover the kernel's various functional
      areas. Partý1 of the series is below and describes the most important changes to the network
      stack, and the related LAN and Wi-Fi hardware drivers. Over the coming weeks, further articles
      will discuss the kernel's storage support, filesystems, architecture code, infrastructure, and
      other hardware drivers.

        [Roger Luedecke: Gobi loader and mobile broadband providers](http://opensuseadventures.blogspot.com/2011/11/gobi-loader-and-mobile-broadband.html)
      

I don't know how many of you have 3G hardware built into your netbooks, but as you can
        probably guess its not always straightforward. Frankly, it took me months to figure out what
        I was doing and get it working consistently. Then while I was running 11.4 I decided to give
        Mandriva a try (which had some critical flaws) and so I reinstalled openSUSE. Now all of a
        sudden the process I had figured out so well, didn't work as it should have. I was tired of
        reinstalling and trying to figure it out, so I figured I would just wait until 12.1 came out
        and pray that the fresh install of it would fix my problem. 

So now I have installed 12.1RC2. And at first it looked encouraging, though the hardware
        wasn't accesible quite I could however go into the NetworkManager Mobile Broadband tab to
        set up a connection and it would show me Verizon as selectable. That is what the crucial
        problem I have been having is about; Verizon is not selectable for some odd reason. Maybe,
        just maybe I somehow did get the firware mixed up but I severely doubt it since I remember
        having to go through this process a few times.

        [LinuxForum.com/steelmanronald06: Screen - The Path For Beginners](http://www.linuxforum.com/content.php/131-Screen-The-Path-For-Beginners)
      

**Overview & Uses**

Screen is a great tool, and highly recommended, tool for any Linux user. It provides a Terminal environment that can withstand network disconnects, random computer restarts, power outages at home and more. With screen you can be assured that if PuTTY, or whatever SSH Client you use, closes you will almost never lose your work. Sadly this is not true for a server restart, as far as I'm aware, but it still provides amazing possibilities. In this wiki you'll find instructions for installation and customization that will not only enhance screen for the best, but will also make it more enjoyable to use. If you're like me, once you start to use screen you'll never go back to mundane old terminal. Please note that all of these steps were done on my system, which I will provide screenshots for, but this is not the only way to set your screen environment up. To add to that, there are also numerous other alterations you may make to your screen environment. Feel free to play around with it and see what you come up with. (...)

**1. Introduction**

As [promised](http://how-to.linuxcareer.com/c-development-on-linux-comparison-between-c-and-other-programming-languages), starting with this part of our C development article, we will get started with learning, without further introduction. I couldn't find no better way to start other than this, because types, operators and variables are an essential part of C and you will use them all the time when writing your own programs. For example, you can write a simple C program without defining your own functions, but it's harder to do that without some variables, unless you wanna stick to "Hello, world!". A variable is nothing more than a location in memory holding a value that can be altered (hence the name). But before you declare a variable you must know what kind of value you want it to hold, and here you will use types. And in order to **
          operate
        ** on those variables, you'll need...operators, of course. I intend to make this course as concise as possible, so I recommend attention and as usual, practice. Any questions can be addressed on our [forums](http://forum.linuxcareer.com/), and we will do our best to answer them. (...)

This tutorial shows how you can serve CGI scripts (Perl scripts) with nginx on OpenSUSE 11.4. While nginx itself does not serve CGI, there are several ways to work around this. I will outline two solutions: the first is to proxy requests for CGI scripts to Thttpd, a small web server that has CGI support, while the second solution uses a CGI wrapper to serve CGI scripts.

If your network includes a domain controller (either a Windows computer or a Samba server), you can use its user database instead of or in addition to maintaining local login users in a Linux computer's local account database. Doing so requires using a set of tools known as Winbind. This toolset can be handy even for Linux computers that don't run Samba to share files or printers; users with Windows domain accounts can log in at the console or use SSH to access Linux-only features, use POP or IMAP mail servers with Windows domain authentication, and so on.

      whats that? We have this Tool per default in KDE 4.7. But sadly some of us not knowing exactly
      what to to with this. 

The first time who uses a Project this Activities in a constant way, this was the Plasma
      Active Project. 

The Idea is to collect Programs, Documents, Contacts, Pictures, Movies and
      Internet-Bookmarks in a human understandable way. In the real life we're collecting similar
      things in similar "Mind-Boxes". The Activities using the same Scheme. 

Let's guessing we are organizing a Birthday-Party for our Grandma. We need for that Task
      some special Contacts, maybe some Websites with Party-Accesoires, maybe some nice little
      Movies from Grandmas golden times and a Textwriter Program who you can prepare Invitements for
      the Party. 

The Activities can help you know. Creating an new Activity presents a blank Screen. If
      you're starting an Application like the Writer you can use the share-like-connect Combo to
      make the App available in the present Activity. You can use it to many interesting things.

      [Jörg Stephan: The Packman Repo (cause of sox)](http://suseserver.de/?p=56)
    

This post does not target any server specific issue. But aims on showing you another repo
      wich is not already placed in the official OpenSuse repository.

This is called Packman [http://packman.links2linux.de/](http://packman.links2linux.de/)

In this repo you
      can find many software pakets which you maybe need. I found the repo while trying to convert
      some of my .ogg files to .mp3. A forum just told me that i could do it just with

      [Fridrich Strba: LibreOffice Visio Import filter: the goodness soon on your desktop](http://fridrich.blogspot.com/2011/11/it-has-been-long-time-since-i-last-time.html)
    

It has been a long time since I last time blogged about the LibreOffice Visio import
      filter. My silence did not prevent a pretty cool code from falling gradually into our [git repository](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/contrib/libvisio/). To the point where now we are working on the last 5% of features that normally
      take the 95% of development time. But, let us see what happened since my [July blog](http://fridrich.blogspot.com/2011/07/libreoffice-visio-import-filter-round.html):

First of
      all, [Eilidh](http://www.derivativezero.com/blog/) was busy as a bee and, in the second half of the Google Summer of Code,
      implemented support of stylesheets, stencils and basic text. She also debugged and fixed quite
      a number of imperfections that [Valek](http://bugware.livejournal.com/) found. Frankly speaking, this Google Summer of Code was
      by far the best from my point of view. We managed to achieve a very good fidelity of import
      only in about 3 and half months. Impressive. (...)

      [Oyranos: Scarse Profile Library Warning](http://www.oyranos.org/2011/11/scarse-profile-library-warning/)
    

Scarse is a project for profiling scanners under GPL based on Argyll code. It started in
      the old century and became pretty silent, with [the last news dating from 2005](http://www.oyranos.org/2005/11/scarse-0-4-alpha-released/). The project provides a nice collection of ICC profiles in the [Scarse Profile Library](http://www.scarse.org/goodies/profiles/), which is now
      used by some open source graphics packages. ICC profiles referring to standards are used to
      describe the exact colorimetry of a colour space. The ICC profiles are used to convert to and
      from other colour spaces in order to exchange with applications, services and customers. It is
      therefore crucial to meet these standards otherwise results will be incorrect right from the
      beginning and might render further colour work damaged. (...)

Balsam Professional 12.1, a boxed version of openSUSE with installation support and
        additional packages, is now available. Developed by [open-slx,](http://www.open-slx.de/en/) who previously made the "openSUSE box", the new name reflects the
        company's desire to present itself as its own brand, independent of openSUSE.

![](http://www.h-online.com/imgs/43/7/3/6/3/1/3/Balsam_logo-6736b098b491125d.png)

Version 12.1 of Balsam Professional is based on the second release candidate of [openSUSE 12.1](http://en.opensuse.org/12.1) and is now available in English,
        including [Bolton Linux](http://www.bolin.org.uk/opencart/index.php), at
        an introductory price of pound45. The package includes a double-sided DVD-10 with 32- and
        64-bit versions of the operating system and a DVD-9 with add-ons with more than one thousand
        applications. The distribution includes KDE 4.7 and GNOME 3.2 with a [Linux 3.1](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/What-s-new-in-Linux-3-1-1347364.html) kernel and systemd. Also included is [KDE Plasma Active One](http://www.h-online.com/news/item/KDE-releases-Plasma-Active-One-1358079.html), an environment designed for tablets and other mobile devices
        which open-slx co-develops.

        [Datamation/Eric Spiegel: Three Ways Developers Can Deal With Tough Customers](http://www.datamation.com/applications/three-ways-developers-can-deal-with-tough-customers-1.html)
      

We all know that lighting matches near a combustible substance like gasoline is not a good idea. Yet people go up in smoke every year.

Similarly, putting a developer and a customer in the same room can have a combustible effect. Many developers tend to be very direct, and talk in technical terms the customer can’t comprehend. They sometimes have very little patience for customers who send mixed message about their requirements.

As a result, many developers (and their projects) go up in smoke every year as well. (...)

Hiring a junior Linux System Administrator can be a challenging task, especially if you are interviewing for someone who is above your own Linux skill set! How do you know for sure that they are going to be any good at what they say they can do? What are the best interview questions to ask a junior Linux System Admin?

In our experience, the best way to gauge an employees skill set is to put them in front of a command line interface and have them execute a number of straightforward tasks. Oftentimes, candidates will say that they have strong skills in Linux, but when confronted with an actual problem, they don't have the "tools" to fix it themselves. So, what we look for is a candidate's ability to use tools, rather than their ability to fix a particular problem. (...)

[Maqetta](http://maqetta.org/) is an **open source project that provides WYSIWYG visual authoring of HTML5 user interfaces**. The

        requiring additional plugins or downloads.

Maqetta **allows User Experience Designers (UXD) to perform drag/drop assembly of live UI mockups**. One of Maqetta’s key design goals is to
        create developer-ready UI mockups that promote efficient hand-off from designers to
        developers. The user interfaces created by Maqetta are real-life web applications that can
        be handed off to developers, who can then transform the application incrementally from UI
        mockup into final shipping application. (...)

        [Sysadmin.lt: How does Linux kernel detect and plug in your hardware? Kernel, sysfs, udev and dbus collaboration.](http://blogas.sysadmin.lt/?p=141)
      

I have been administrating Linux systems for a while now and were always strugling to „dig deeper“. Today I found myself wondering how does Linux detect, plug in my hardware and show that pop-up window asking me to choose what I want to do with my flash drive. So I launched my web browser and began to search for an answers in forums, tutorials and how-tos which almost ended in complete failure. I say „almost“ because I did find some of the answers but they all were scattered and incomplete or too old. So I had to use „heavy artillery“ and read through all those manuals… And I think I finally get it how it works :) This is what I will try to explain further. *I really hope I didn’t misunderstand something* (...)
