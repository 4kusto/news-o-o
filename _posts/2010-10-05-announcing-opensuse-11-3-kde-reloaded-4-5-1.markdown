The openSUSE KDE Community would like to announce the [openSUSE 11.3 KDE 4.5 respin](http://home.kde.org/~kdelive/#reloaded). Â Dubbed 'KDE Reloaded', it includes the [KDE 4.5.1 release](http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-4.5.1.php) of Plasma Desktop, Plasma Netbook, the standard KDE applications plus latest versions of apps outside the KDE release cycle like Amarok and Digikam. Â It also includes all the released online updates for 11.3, saving you a lengthy download at install time compared to the vanilla 11.3.

The image uses the KDE:Release:45 repository that tracks the latest stable KDE 4.5 release, so you won't get any surprise update to KDE 4.6 as you would if you were using the development repositories. Â The packages are community maintained - this is not an officially supported release by the entire openSUSE project. Â It is seen as at least as stable as vanilla openSUSE 11.3.
