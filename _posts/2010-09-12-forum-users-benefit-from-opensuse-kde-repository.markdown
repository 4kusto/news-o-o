Without question, users who frequent the openSUSE forums are very appreciative of all the work being done by ALL the various development teams. The progressive nature of KDE4 continues to spark a great deal of interest generally, though especially do users want options to try the latest and greatest, yet at the same time maintain a level of stability. With KDE development moving so quickly between distribution releases, users don't want to be stuck with the distro release version of KDE. The much requested 4.5.* stable repo has now been provided for openSUSE 11.3 users. Those currently using the Factory repo will now be able to switch to:
`http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/KDE:/Release:/45/openSUSE_11.3/`

A great shout of praise must go out to all those involved in making this repository possible.
