If you want to help testing our standard test cases, please coordinate with others and subscribe to [opensuse-testing@opensuse.org](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-testing/) ([subscribe](mailto:opensuse-testing+subscribe@opensuse.org))!

I'd like to do a special call for testing our update stack.Â  Besides the installation itself, updating packages is one of the most important criteria so that we can deliver fixes and you can install software.Â  Some test cases are available at [http://en.opensuse.org/Libzypp/Testsuite](http://en.opensuse.org/Libzypp/Testsuite). Please also use the updates we're going to put on our update server.Â  You can install packages and updates with the YaST Qt and Gtk packager modules, with the opensuse-updater applets for GNOME and KDE and additionally with the command line tool zypper.

Thanks,

Andreas
