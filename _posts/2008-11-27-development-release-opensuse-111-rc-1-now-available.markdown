The openSUSE Project is happy to announce that openSUSE 11.1 RC 1 is now available. If all goes well, this will be the last testing release before the final 11.1 public release on December 18th.

This release includes a number of bugfixes and changes since 11.1 beta 5, as well as a new license.

Digg it! [//digg.com/linux_unix/Development_Release_openSUSE_11_1_RC_1_Now_Available](//digg.com/linux_unix/Development_Release_openSUSE_11_1_RC_1_Now_Available)


### Call for Testing


We all want openSUSE 11.1 to be the best release yet, and we need your help to get there. This release is ready for widespread testing, and we're encouraging everyone to download and work with the testing releases to find any critical bugs before release. Please run the release through your usual routine, and let us know about any bugs or other issues that you find.

Remember that this is a release candidate, and is not suitable for use on production systems, however. Though many openSUSE users can and do use the Factory distribution and/or testing releases for day-to-day work we want to stress that it's entirely possible that you will encounter serious bugs.

See [openSUSE.org/Testing](//openSUSE.org/Testing) for more information on Testing.

To follow the testing and development process, we suggest that you subscribe to the openSUSE-Factory mailing list, and join the #openSUSE-Factory channel on Freenode to discuss openSUSE development.


### What's changed since beta 5?


Major changes in this release include:

* A [new](//zonker.opensuse.org/2008/11/26/opensuse-sports-a-new-license-ding-dong-the-eulas-dead/), shorter [distro license](//en.opensuse.org/OpenSUSE_EULA)
* Linux kernel 2.6.27.7
* glibc 2.9
* [Additional translations](//i18n.opensuse.org/stats/trunk/toplist.php)
* Amarok 2.0 RC 1

See the [Factory News](//en.opensuse.org/Factory/News) page for changes in the Factory distribution between release announcements. [DistroWatch](//distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=suse) also carries an expanded list of packages being shipped in the Factory distribution.


### Media and Download

Note that you don't need to choose a mirror yourself, but you can use the mirror list if you want or need to select a mirror manually.


### Most Annoying Bugs


While many bugs have been eliminated since the last beta, we still have a few remaining (and new) bugs that testers should be aware of:

Bug [448270](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=448270): the license has no translations yet
