[![rsync logo](//rsync.samba.org/newrsynclogo.jpg)](//rsync.samba.org/)Our rsync server 'rsync.opensuse.org' is currently unreliable and crashes very often. Reason might be hardware related: we are still searching for the real issue.

Please choose one of the available rsync mirrors listed on [//mirrors.opensuse.org/](//mirrors.opensuse.org/) instead: those get their files from our staging server and are normally as up to date as rsync.opensuse.org.

Sorry for the inconvenience caused. We will update this post once we fixed the problem.
