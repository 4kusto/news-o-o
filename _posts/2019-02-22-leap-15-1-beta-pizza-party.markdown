#### Hunt for bugs & have a lot of fun!


The release manager for [openSUSE Leap](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Leap) announced that [Leap 15.1 entered its Beta phase](http://bit.ly/2GAeXGT) this week and that means it's time for a Beta Pizza Party. [Yeah](https://youtu.be/GxBSyx85Kp8?t=10)!.

[Leap's Beta](https://software.opensuse.org/distributions/testing) phase is a rolling beta until it's official release. Once released, it will begin its maintenance phase.

To celebrate the Beta phase, why not have a Pizza Party and test the openSUSE Leap 15.1 Beta.

Geeko in Nuremberg will have a Beta Pizza Party on March 1, 2019 during lunch. Any Beta tester in the Nuremberg area are welcome to attend. Just email ddemaio (@) opensuse.org.

If there’s no party near you, [organize your own](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:BetaPizzaParty#Beta_Pizza_Party). Be sure to check [the wiki page! ](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:BetaPizzaParty#Beta_Pizza_Party)Pick a local pizza place or get some delivered to your home or office; invite friends and colleagues and [put your party on the wiki](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:BetaPizzaParty#Beta_Pizza_Party). A new openSUSE user may show up! If you are unsure of how to do it, read[ this](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Launch_party_HOWTO).

### Testing and helping out!

Bugs should be reported and can be tracked via [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/index.cgi). Find a [how-to on reporting bugs on the wiki](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Submitting_bug_reports).

Discussions about openSUSE development takes place on the openSUSE Factory [mailing list](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory).  If you want to help out, please see the wiki page on [contributing to Factory](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:How_to_contribute_to_Factory).
