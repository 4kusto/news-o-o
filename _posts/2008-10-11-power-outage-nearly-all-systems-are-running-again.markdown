Our admins and developers - in Nuernberg, Provo and from home offices - worked hard today to get all openSUSE services up and running again.Â  Thanks a lot to all of them!

Nearly all services are be up and running again.Â  The only exceptions are the services features and ideas, these will be restarted latest by Monday.
