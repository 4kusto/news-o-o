## Introducing Heinlein


Heinlein Support has specialized in Linux servers and e-mail services for over 20 years. They share their knowledge and their experience at the Heinlein Academy, during personal consultations, through their hosting services, and through their appliance and software products.

Peer Heinlein said: 

<blockquote>After working with SUSE technologies since 1994, we're very happy to have a chance to contribute something back to the openSUSE Community. For our customers, the (open)SUSE-platform has always been a very reliable distribution for business and enterprise use cases.</blockquote>





## Supporting openSUSE


We are happy to announce that [Heinlein Support](http://heinlein-support.de/) is sponsoring the openSUSE project by providing infrastructure to run the project.

Henne Vogelsang told us:

<blockquote>I believe Peer and his crew will help us to take our mail infrastructure to the next level and I'm happy that we have the opportunity to work together with them. I mean that guy wrote a book about postfix and has tons of hands-on experience with mail infrastructure, how awesome is that?</blockquote>
