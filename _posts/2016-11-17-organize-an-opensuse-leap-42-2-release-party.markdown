title: "Organize an openSUSE Leap 42.2 Release Party"
---


Having a party to celebrate an achievement is always great and the openSUSE community knows how to party; just look at all the fun we have at openSUSE conferences and summits.

With the release of openSUSE Leap 42.2, a release party is in order. Selecting a good date and having some goodies to pass out to the party requires some planning. The checklist below can help with planning the release party, but the most important thing if you plan on having a party is to email ddemaio (at) suse.de well before the party to get some open-source goodies to give away. Please include “Leap 42.2” Party in the subject line and include a mailing address.

**checklist:**



 	
  1. ** Find a date.**


The date of a party is best during a weekend (because it’s easier for people to join, since most people work during the week), but we all function differently. Find two alternative dates for the party if you want and use [http://www.doodle.com/](http://www.doodle.com/) to find a common date that works for most people.



 	
  2. ** Find a place**


A cafe, bar or Linux group meetup location all work. A coffee and cake release party is just as fun as a beer and pizza release party with the benefit of not having a headache. If music is your group’s thing, try a release party with openSUSE karaoke. There are tons of [SUSE songs](http://bit.ly/2eJv2wx) to choose from on it’s YouTube play list.

  3. ** Cake**


It is not necessary to have a cake, but it sure is a lot of fun. You can also have openSUSE Cookies. We plan on having a few at the release party in Nuremberg, Germany, on Nov. 24 starting at 5 p.m.

 	
  4. ** Pictures, pictures, pictures**


Bring one or more cameras to take pictures or videos and post them to social media. Tagging the photos with #GeekoParty

 	
  5. ** Swag**


PromoDVDs, webcam covers and stickers - If we can get it to you without too much red tape from governments, we will. Just email that ddemaio guys.

**IMPORTANT TIP:** Schedule your [release party](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Launch_parties) on the wiki and have a lot of fun.
