## Systemd needs your feedback


The team welcomes help and bugreports as we prepare for the first release of openSUSE to use systemd.




## Hands on to help out easier than ever!


Your input at this early development stage is a great opportunity to collaborate in making the final release into the polished work we always prosecute for. openSUSE 12.1 Milestone 3 has a [list of most annoying bugs here](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Most_annoying_bugs_12.1_dev), please add issues you find and help fix them. As Will Stephenson has [already blogged](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/05/16/have-you-burped-yet-today/), fixing an issue is a matter of **BURP**ing on [build.opensuse.org](http://build.opensuse.org/)! Find a how-to [here](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_Collaboration#Example_with_web_interface).
