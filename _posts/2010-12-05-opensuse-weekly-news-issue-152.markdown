There's been many discussions over the past years about a "rolling update" version of
openSUSE on lots of different mailing lists and in person a different conferences. So the time
now is to stop talking about it, and actually trying to do it :) So, I'd like to propose
"openSUSE Tumbleweed" a repo that is a rolling updated version of openSUSE containing the
latest "stable" versions of packages for people to use. (...)

openFATE, the feature tracking tool used in openSUSE has been completely reworked and the
new version is live now on features.opensuse.org. A team has started driving the handling of
features and we™d like to update you with the current state and invite you to participate. The
new version is now live and contains a long list of new features so that features can be
handled completely with the new web user interface. The interface uses the new openSUSE Bento
theme to fit in better in the openSUSE site family, has several search options to allow the
screening team to find features easily, it™s possible to edit all fields and also the product
states. Thanks to the openSUSE boosters, especially to Thomas Schmidt, for the new version.
The new team has defined a workflow to handle features and described it in the openSUSE wiki.

[openSUSE Announces Fourth Development Milestone with Kernel Interactivity Patch](https://news.opensuse.org/2010/12/02/opensuse-announces-fourth-development-milestone-with-kernel-interactivity-patch/)
**


> 
> 
On Monday, the openSUSE project released the fourth of six milestones in the development
of openSUSE 11.4. Milestone 4 (M4) brings a wide range of updates, both major and
minor.

Kernel 2.6.37rc3 is the basis of M4, including the famous 200 line per tty task groups
patch to improve desktop interactivity, and featuring the removal of the so-called ˜Big Kernel
Lock™ that will improve scalability.

NetworkManager was updated to 0.8.2, seeing several last minute fixes in cooperation with
upstream developers.

Libzypp 8.8 adds support for metalinks, the multiple download URL specification.

On the desktops, KDE makes the leap to version 4.6 beta 1. This includes a complete
rewrite of Kontact and is undergoing heavy testing. GNOME 2.32.2 is the final version planned
for openSUSE 11.4, which is notable for being the last stable release before GNOME 3 in March.
Zeitgeist, the activity tracker, is updated to 0.6. KOffice is updated to 2.3beta1, bringing
the exciting Krita natural media painting app to M4, while OpenOffice.org is removed, having
been succeeded by LibreOffice in M3. Qt 4.7.1 and Qt Creator 2.1beta2 will allow improved Qt
Quick development. Other major updates include the addition of the Midori lightweight browser,
the Rosegarden musical notation editor in version 10.10 and monodevelop 2.4. Gnash, the free
Flash viewer, comes in version 0.8.8, which has 100% Youtube support and supports hardware
acceleration.

And finally, the prize for biggest version number leap goes to xmahjong, which went from
2006.8.10 to 2010.11.8. xmahjong fans will be happy to hear that the version bump is only due
to a packaging change removing build support for SUSE versions earlier than 9.1. The graphics
and gameplay remain as they were in 1990.

A [list of most annoying bugs](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Most_annoying_bugs_11.4_dev#openSUSE_11.4_Milestone_4_of_6) is being compiled; please check it before installing. We
look forward to [your bug reports](http://bit.ly/el1dv8) and test
experiences too. Automated testing and the openSUSE Factory team have been active to ensure
that your download of M4 will be at least minimally functional.

The next milestone is scheduled for December 16. openSUSE 11.4 is planned to be released
in March 2011.</blockquote>

The openSUSE Marketing Team is proud to host Collaboration Days during the month of
December. Each designated day, we will focus on a specifc area related to marketing. The
purpose of this is to get some work done on that topic to strengthen our ability to promote
openSUSE to the world. It is a day that is meant to be busy and productive for the team as
well as an opportunity for non-team members to stop by and offer their perspectives and help
out as we hack away. As this is an open process, we encourage everyone to come join us, even
if you are not directly related to openSUSE. All perspectives are important and we welcome you
all.</blockquote>






















## openSUSE Board Election 2010

**[Sebastian 'sebas'
Kügler: Running for the openSUSE Board.](http://nmarques.digitalwhores.net/2010/10/16/to-nuremberg/)**


> 
> 
Following up on the call for candidates, I™d like to let you know that I™m intending to
run for the openSUSE Board.

In my dayjob, I am responsible for user experience at open-slx, and will be able to invest
time on a regular basis into participating in the openSUSE board. I have a degree in business
science, which gives me some formal insight into organisational processes, this has helped my
work for the KDE e.V. in the past, and it will surely be benefitial for openSUSE. I am 34
years old, and live in Nijmegen, in the east of the Netherlands.

I have more than 4 years of experience in administering a Free software project (I™m
member of the KDE e.V. board since 2006), and during this period have helped turning the KDE
e.V. into an effective community representation and supporting organisation, which in many
ways acts as a role model to other, similar organisations. The Geeko in me is about 9 years
old, it started with openSUSE 7.2, which got me hooked on Linux. After a period of trying all
kinds of Linuxen, I™m firmly back to openSUSE for about two years now.

openSUSE represents to me a technically excellent product with a friendly, helpful and
skilled community around it that is failing to realise its potential, and in many ways is
searching for orientation and a clear mission. Aside from organisational topics, this process
I™d like to facilitate.

My platform for the elections is to help set up the openSUSE e.V. (or rather a legal
representation of the community, as outlined in the current plans), and to help the community
through the process of becoming more independent from Novell, which in my opinion is important
for the growth and sustainability of openSUSE as product and community. I™m a Free software
dude by heart, and the principle and ethics of the Free software community will be what drives
my decisions as executive. My experience as "cat-herder" will be beneficial in the same
way.

I do realise that my involvement in the openSUSE community has been fairly transparant,
following things from the sideline, stepping in actively here and there, and certainly far
from taking on any role as rock-star. I am planning to further ramp up my profile, since that
a) will make the members™ decision during the elections a lot easier, and b) it improves
accessibility and visibility of the TOTRoS (The Organisation That Represents openSUSE).

This email is just to let you know in advance that I™m intending to run for the board. As
I /also/ intend to go on vacation on Friday, I might appear unresponsive until ~christmas.
Still, I opted for letting everybody know early on that I™m intending to run (rather than
sending my note of intent to run after christmas), as planning will likely make the work of
the election committee a bit easier. Surely, if you™ve questions already, feel free to ask. I
will, after returning from vacation be more outgoing about my involvement with openSUSE and my
ideas and plans for the openSUSE board. Thanks for your attention, and your support.</blockquote>

**[Chuck 'terrorpup' Payne: Throwing my
name as a candidate for board of openSUSE](http://opensuse.terrorpup.net/?p=176)**


> 
> 
I like to throw my name in as a candidate for board of openSUSE. For the past two years I
have been helping out as Ambassador, but I have been a SUSE user since 5.3. I love my work
with openSUSE, and I want to do more. I think my experince as System Administrator, End User,
Mentor, and Ambassador, plus years of experience would be a big plus to board and to the
community.

I started out with Linux in 96² as an end, tried of Mac OS, and fearing that it would
died. This was before the return of Steve Jobs. Start with Slackware 96 then move to Red Hat
and Turbo Linux, then moving to S.u.S.E and never leaving it.

I have worked in the IT field as System Administrator since 98. My first job, I was able
to get S.u.S.E 6.2 in to replace Red Hat 6.0. Personally I have used it since 5.3 as server.
It was until openSUSE 10.2 that I started using as a Desktop replacement at work for daily to
daily, replacing Windows XP and Macintosh OS X OS™es. I can be honest, I still use Mac OS for
some desktop publishing, but I use my openSUSE desktop for the other 90%.

When the call came for people to become Ambassador back in 2008, I jumped at the chance to
give back to openSUSE in return for everything it has giving to me. I have been to three linux
fest. Give a couple of number of talks to local user group. I have even wrote for a Polish
Linux this summer called Linux Identity. I have even done a video for the OSC, which was the
best but did put some faces to aliases. I am working on other projects that once are done I
will show the community.

The other thing I am doing currently for openSUSE is I help with the Facebook page. Trying
to post links and events. And I have even set up a twitter account for the openSUSE Ambassador
that I hope in the furture and help get out their great work to community and others.

I am currently rebuilding the Georgia openSUSE User Group. I am active in ALE. And love to
go to Linux Fest and help spread the word about openSUSE and open source software to the
masses.

My daily-to-daily life, I am System Administrator for a start company called Vocalocity
that does a lot with SIP/Telecommunications in their NOC team. Before that I worked at Travel
Channel Media. I am married. I am very much international. I know that a lot of people don™ t
think that of American. But I have lived in Japan for three and half years and taught English
Communications. My wife is Turkish. I do travel from here to there no as much as I would like.
I have a six year son that know I love Linux and every time he see a penguin points out that,
There that software you work with Daddy. I also have a black cat that loves to sit in my lap
while I am computer working. I am a bit old I think than most, I am 43 but with that I bring a
lot of experience to the table, one not being a developer, but as a end user, a system
administrator. Which covers both every day-to-day users and business.</blockquote>

'warlordfff' Koudaras: Board Member Application](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2010-12/msg00034.html)**

Hello world I would like you to know that I want to run as a candidate for the board of
openSUSE. I am a seasonal forest firefighter in my 'day' job, so as you can understand,
contributing for the common good is all I do in my life.

I am into FOSS for a couple of years now but I am a man of action so I do most of the
things I plan and do not stay in plans.I am currently the event manager of Association of
Greek Users and Friends of FS / OSS (GREEKLUG) and I was responsible for organizing the host
and speech of Richard Stallman here in Thessaloniki, which was a huge success. I spend four
days with him and I learned many things about the meaning of Free Software, among other
things, and got deeply effected and motivated by his words.

I started working with openSUSE almost a year ago and I became ambassador on that summer.
Since I became ambassador I made quite a few things about it, as I said a man of action. Me
along with Stathis 'Diamond_gr' Iosifidis organized the Greek openSUSE community from scratch.
We re-activated the Greek IRC channel which was almost dead. We started the [http://amb.opensuse.gr](http://amb.opensuse.gr) so that the world can see our
actions as ambassadors. We were the openSUSE team at the 75th International Trade Fair of
Thessaloniki. We made a call for all Greek Geekos to gather and for a community, although at
that time (a few months ago) almost every 'expert' told us that it would end up a great
failure, we never stopped fighting and finally we prove them wrong. We recently started
translating the openSUSE Weekly news and I am responsible for gathering and checking the
translation. We started re-organize and translating the Greek wiki. We went to Athens were we
actually met suseRocks and spoke with him about several matters about the community and the
project.I went to several city™s all over Greece in order to meet in person people of the
Greek community because I strongly believe that face to face communication builds actual trust
and I do whatever is possible to prove people that I truly deserve their trust. Greek
ambassador team trusted me to be the one communicating the board if needed in order to
separate jobs inside the Greek community. I participated in several innovating events for
openSUSE like the Xariseto Free festival. I represented openSUSE to an event at primary school
in Thessaloniki for celebrating Software Freedom Day 2010.

Beyond the Greek community I participate actively in the marketing and the ambassador
teams and I am trying to do the same at other teams too. Andreas Jaeger recently trusted me to
be the one of three at the Ambassador Welcome Team. I probably forgot some of the things I do
but the general idea about me as a person and also my moto for my campaign is 'Planning is
good, but acting is better'. I totally believe in team working and I think that I co-operate
great with others. I am a Hacker in life more than I am a hacker in programming,in fact I
don't know almost no programming at all nor I am good at solving technically nature problems.
I tend to like my disadvantages and use them as actual advantages. I think outside of the box
and try to think with as much playful cleverness as I can get. I believe deeply in evolution
and I am not afraid to bleed my ego for evolution to come. I don't stare at targets, I hit
them till I get them and I never give up.

If you read the whole text above I truly thank you,if not I can understand you I hope for
your support</blockquote>

Awesomeness. I just heard that already 3 people stepped up for the 2010 openSUSE Board
elections. And Sascha posted the announcement only yesterday!

Really, this is something that shows how openSUSE is a healthy community. We have plenty
of people who are able and willing to do this - which is really great. Thanks to those who
stepped up - there are only 2 positions, but even the act of stepping forward and saying
you're willing to do this is very important!

The openSUSE Board work is very important and becoming more so. Currently work is being
done on setting up an openSUSE Foundation - and the board plays a crucial role there. We need
people with some experience and willingness to work hard on this, there is a lot of work. If
you fit that bill - apply!</blockquote>

nearly all need some improvements. So what yout think, I am on the right way with this?
Dont look at the text on them, thats then really up to the marketing guys. What I want to
show is, that openSUSE is more as a distribution we have cool tools for creating software
and some cool derivates too. I try to show some of cool feature that openSUSE have. So

In the introduction Lubos shared that apparently you have to
package each application by hand - however, automatic downloading of

all linux distributions on distrowatch.org is planned for OBS 3.0!

On the next 11th of November the Portuguese enthusiasts are meeting up for a friendly
Christmas Dinner in the beautiful city of Aveiro in the Silver Coast of Portugal (Litoral
Center, the famous Aveiro Geographical Delta, the biggest natural geographical delta in
Europe).

This isn™t a formal meeting, but instead an effort to get the existing enthusiasts to
know themselves personally, to have some fun and trade ideas. During our Christmas Dinner we
expect to receive input from our enthusiasts regarding the assembly of a Portuguese Task
Force to handle our representation in the openSUSE International Community.

Though we don™t have a stone set script for the topics some of us would like to
approach, I would like at least to approach the following ones:

* **openSUSE Iberia** “ When I was superficially enrolled
with the Fedora Project, I™ve tried to rebuild the Portuguese Community associated with the
Spanish Community. It didn™t happened back then, but I rejoiced in happiness when this
possibility was approached by Javier Lorentte and directed to Carlos GonÃ§alves. I am a great
supporter of such initiative for the following reasons:

> 
> 

> 
> 
	
>   * Geography stands as an Opportunity; Both Portugal and Spain are the two countries on
the ˜Peninsula Iberica™ (Iberian Peninsula) and share at least the last 1000 years of
history. By working together we can accomplish outstanding deeds, specially related to
Events and promotion.
> 


> 
> 

>

> 
> 
	
>   * Culture stands as an Opportunity; Culturally speaking, Portugal and Spain are very
similar in many ways and share the last 1000 years of History. Both countries present a
strong Roman Catholic background, this means that societies behaviors, values and
identity are pretty much shared between us. The language itself becomes friendly as most
Spanish and Portuguese can actually dialog in a mix of our languages. For example the
Portuguese language was born from Galaic-Portuguese, which is also the root of the
language spoken in Galicia (Spain).

The team is happy to announce the release of SMB Traffic Analyzer (SMBTA in the following)
version 1.2.1. This is a very important release, as many fixes have been done for the build,
making both smbtad and smbtatools much more portable. Also, the build has been adapted to work
with libraries that are not installed at the usual places on the system (bnc#654930). On the
feature side, we have two really cool things to say. First off, we are introducing rrddriver
with this release. It is an interface to rrdtool, and allows to build a round robin database
from the data smbtad is receiving, in real time. Having data in a rrdtool database allows you
to create all the fancy graphics SMBTA was missing until today (bnc#655149). (...)</blockquote>

I™m happy to announce LibreOffice 3.3 rc1 packages for openSUSE. They are available in the
Build Service[
LibreOffice:Unstable](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/LibreOffice:/Unstable/) project. They are based on the [libreoffice-3.3.0.1 release](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/build/plain/NEWS?id=LIBREOFFICE_3_3_0_1). Please, look for more details about the openSUSE
LibreOffice build on the [wiki page](http://en.opensuse.org/OpenOffice.org).

The packages are based on release candidate sources but they have not passed full QA round
yet and might include even serious bugs. Therefore they are not intended for data-critical
usage. A good practice is to archive any important data before an use, ¦

As usual, we kindly ask any interested beta testers to try the package and[ report bugs](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Bugreport_OOo) against the product
LibreOffice .

**Known Bugs:**

>

**The Nouveau driver now supports power management and can address the
GeForce 320M, and the code for Intel graphics cores now supports the video units on Sandy
Bridge processors, which are due to be released shortly. A number of changes to the Radeon
KMS driver should improve its performance. **

Linus Torvalds [released](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1066261) the third pre-release version of Linux 2.6.37 ten days ago and then
despite Thanksgiving and a [trip to
Tokyo](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.pci/9946/focus%3D9947), he kept to his usual tempo and the fourth pre-release version was released two
days ago.

The final release of 2.6.37 will probably be in late December or early January next year.
The current developer version already resembles the final version pretty closely, since kernel
hackers have, as ever, used the merge window which opens the development cycle, to merge all
major changes into the main development tree. The current stabilisation phase is reserved
primarily for bug-fixes rather than major changes, to avoid introducing further bugs.

**[Linux.com/Amanda McPherson: Our Annual Kernel Development Report: New (and Old) Faces
](http://www.linux.com/news/featured-blogs/amanda-mcpherson/386194:our-annual-kernel-development-report-new-and-old-faces)**


> 
> 
Today we are pleased to publish [annual report
on Linux kernel development](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/docs/lf_linux_kernel_development_2010.pdf), detailing who does the work, who sponsors it and how
fast the Linux kernel is growing.

The paper documents how hard at work the Linux community has been. There have been 1.5
million lines of code added to the kernel since the 2009 update. Since that last paper,
additions and changes translate to an amazing 9,058 lines added, 4,495 lines removed, and
1,978 lines changed every day, Â­ weekends and holidays included.

The other good news is that in the list of sponsoring entities we see more mobile and
embedded companies participating in Linux kernel development. We see companies such as Nokia,
Texas Instruments and Renasas moving up the list of companies who sponsor Linux development.
This certainly should not be a surprise given the rise of Linux usage in devices over the last
few years. This is great to see, even though the traditional Linux supporters are still at the
top of the list: Red Hat, Intel, Novell and IBM.

This paper documents a bit less frenzied development than the last one, which was expected
given all the new features of 2.6.30 (ext4, ftrace, btrfs, perf etc) as well as the peak of
merged drivers from Linux stable tree. Regardless, this report continues to paint a picture of
a very strong and vibrant development community.

I™d like to congratulate Paul Mundt who had the most individual contributions to the
kernel, equally 1.3%, since our paper last year, and give my heartfelt thanks to Jon Corbet
and Greg Kroah-Hartman, kernel developers and members of our Technical Advisory Board, who
really do all the work on this paper. This publication is an important one as it gives a rare
glimpse into the world of kernel development. Without their knowledge of the participants and
their technical tools to analyze the code, this analysis would not be possible. If you™re
interested in kernel development and want to support the work of Jon, please consider buying a
subscription at [lwn.net](http://www.lwn.net/).

>

The Linux Foundation has published its third annual report about Linux kernel authorship.
The statistics included in the paper illustrate growth trends in the kernel development
process and provide insight into how the labor is distributed among individual contributors
and corporate sponsors. The kernel has seen modest growth in its base of contributors over the
past year, though the rate of development has seen a marginal decline.

The latest version of the Linux kernel currently consists of approximately 13 million
lines of code across over 33,000 files. The rate of development peaked with version 2.6.30
last year, which saw an average of 6.40 patches per hour. The rate declined to an average of
5.30 patches per hour in version 2.6.35.</blockquote>

I™ve heard asked many times by customers and community members if there was a way to
diff files in Alfresco and alas there isn™t an OTB way to do this. A month ago the
discussion came up again internally. And I thought it might be fun to tackle this as side
project just to see if/what was possible. So I took an evening and hammered out a simple
Java class that did a comparison between two text files. Once I saw that I had at least the
basics (annotate the differences between two files) and had gotten the question of basic
possibility/difficulty out of the way I moved on to other projects. Today almost the entire
family is sick so I thought I™d pick up the project again, moving the Java class to a Java
Backed web script. The web script is a simple GET that takes the nodeRef of two files, or
two versions of the same file and outputs a simple HTML page that highlights the differences
between the two. There are no complex algorithms that take into account shifts in blocks or
identifies just the text in a line that has changed. It is a simple line by line comparison
of two pieces of content. It is not integrated in to Share or Explorer at this time. I might
take that as a separate sick day project (or accept any code contributions to add that).

catching up](http://nowwhatthe.blogspot.com/2010/11/catching-up.html)**

Hi! It feels like ages since I blogged, so here goes. A lot has happened since my last
blog - Latinoware is over (and was frickin' awesome), I had a week off which I enjoyed in
Brazil and now I'm at the Nuremberg offices due to Michl who just left. We had some catching
up to do before he went - same with AJ who has decided to enjoy some parental leave. And
Jaqueline who will have to fill the shoes of these two fine gentlemen. Meanwhile I am trying
to catch up to mail and news - there is a lot of both. Mail catching up has been limited quite
a bit by the KDE Factory OBS repository for 11.3 upgrading to KDE's 4.6 release of platform
(Akonadi!), apps (KMail2) and desktop workspace. The two I mentioned (Akonadi & kmail2)
have been a royal pain in the ass, to be honest. The migration of my old accounts took a night
(>100.000 mails) but didn't actually import those mails. Hence they had to be downloaded from
gmail. With the VERY frequent disconnections and regular hanging of the Akonadi resource this
has taken a while to say the least - lots of babysitting (restarting Akonadi etc) required. I
hope the KDE Pim* dudes and dudettes can get this stable (and faster!) before the release...
Oh, and Virtuoso-t keeps hogging 100% CPU untill I decide to just kill it - after which I
don't notice any bad or strange behavior. Maybe I should auto-kill it on login ;-) but in the
end, it's all working reasonably well now, albeit a bit slower than KMail1.x. Yay yay.

> 
> 
Just recently I found again that openSUSE is not really positioned for some usecases. In
my personal case that is especially the usage as a web/mail/dns/etc server on hosted
environments. IMHO it just doesn™t make sense to roll out a distribution which is supported
for only 18 months to a hosted system with limited access to it. I still have been doing that
with previous openSUSE releases but it™s so annoying that I really regret it. Also the
possibility to zypper dup doesn™t really fix that issue for different reasons. Anyway this
post is not about whining about that fact or to explain why I don™t like to update these type
of systems remotely every <= 18 months.

**A possible solution?** Sometime last year there was a
discussion about options for something like an openSLE or openSUSE LTS distribution. There
is an external page where some outcome was documented here. The dicussions stopped mainly
because of health issues of the main initiator. There was done some planning and voting on the
different options but no real results ever happened (as far as I know). So I™m trying to
resurrect that topic a bit once again: The amount of work related to such a project is the
critical part and therefore my proposal is to try to start off with a lightweight approach.

Novell, the parent company of the SUSE Linux products, and unquestionably a major sponsor of

a repo that is a rolling updated version of openSUSE containing the latest stable
versions of packages for people to use.

I™d describe it like this: An in-between version of openSUSE that offers packages
that are a little bit more current than the most recent release, but not as buggy as the
cutting-edge Factory repository. For those of us who like stability, but don™t want to
miss out on the latest.

So what does this have to do with the Attachmate-Novell hookup? It tells me
that regardless of what happens at the corporate level, there is energy in our community.
There™s reason to believe that energy can sustain this distribution for a long time. Got any
thoughts about the future of openSUSE, and other community distributions with a major

**[Klaas Freitag: Hermes
Work](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/12/01/hermes-work/)**


> 
> 
Not every day is a sunshine day, also not in software development. This is my credo about
the last few days which I spent debugging [Hermes](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Hermes) a bit, motivated by a [kind bug](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=630725) report saying
basically that the digest mails suck. Well, I had to kind of agree on that, so I revisited
that topic.

Do you remember what Hermes is? We use Hermes in the openSUSE infrastructure to handle
notifications. Since we do not want to send people emails they do not explicitly agree that
they want it (otherwise it would be spamming, right?), we invented a system that recognizes
all kinds of events that happen in the openSUSE world, than check if a certain user wants to
know about it and finally send it to these users. The benefit the user of the system is that
he can pick from a huge variety of events and control if and how he gets informed about.
Hermes does not only serve users with email but also maintains RSS feeds, it Twitters and does
even more. And as another bonus, it can collect similar events for you and later send a digest
with a collection. That way, you for example can get a mail with a list of failed package
builds in OBS each hour instead a mail every fife seconds for each and every failing package.

But back to my debugging fun: I was mainly fixing the appearance of the digest messages:
They now in the subject tell you how many events are digested and how frequently the digest
comes, such as hourly, minutely etc. In the mail body, you now find a numbered table of
contents of the mail and the individual events nicely listed. So much more useful.

Unfortunately it wasn™t the most time efficient debugging session I ever had, I stumbled
over some things that weren™t optimal now in an environment where Hermes processes between
40,000 and 70,000 events a day for more than 25,000 users. Some of the problems are ugly to
identify. I got lost a bit which is not good for the overall mood, so I decided to cry at
Susanne, one of our colleagues. She asked me quite a few questions and than she left home for
dinner. Ten minutes later I could nail the bug.

So this is my strong suggestion: If in debugging trouble, talk to your friends. Tell about
the problem, share your misfortune. A few question can guide you to the right path which you
did not see before. Not new? Well, yes, of course we knew that already from other topics in
live, talking helps ;-)

The other suggestion I wanted to make: Check Hermes digests! Go to the [Hermes Subscription Page](http://hermes.opensuse.org) and change one of your
subscriptions to digest mode, will be fun. Let me know what you think.</blockquote>

**[Sirko Kemter: openSUSE pic
paste](http://karl-tux-stadt.de/ktuxs/?p=2925)**


> 
> 
As some of you know, we have our own paste service “ susepaste.org. Miska is responsible
for that service and some time ago we had a little conversation, that for me and the other
artists is more useful to pasting pictures. But not only for us, some times is a screenshot
helpful for others too. So Miska take care of my feature wish and implemented pasting of
pictures. He wrote already a [blogpost](http://michal.hrusecky.net/index.php/blog/show/Pasting-images.html)
for it. You can use the picture pasting if you select Image File at susepast or go directly
to http://img.susepaste.org. So nothing new until yet, why then a blogpost again. Its simple
today, I tried to use the service and failed. I simple did a screenshot and tried to paste it,
and the service told me, its only allowed to past images not bigger then 300k. A simple
screenshot, depending from the resolution is bigger as that. So I spoke with Miska again, the
problem for the file size is that he have not so lot of space for the service. But he had
immediatly a great solution for this and implemented it. You can paste greater pictures now,
it depends from the time, the pic should be kept. So for me that works excellent, because
mostly I need it for seconds or better until the opposite told me thats what I want or
something like that. So now it works really fine for me, thx to Miska.</blockquote>

[ Linux Planet/Sean Michael Kerner: Yes, Novell Owns Unix-Unix Ownership Settled](http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/reports/7233/1/)**


>

When Novell first announced that it was being acquired by Attachmate for $2.2 billion,
the question of who would retain ownership over Unix copyrights was an open issue. As part
of the Novell sale, the company also revealed that it is selling 882 patents to a
Microsoft-led technology consortium for $450 million. Potential ownership of Unix by the
Microsoft-led group could have led to a new round of patent battles between Microsoft and
the open source community. In a terse statement, Novell has now publicly stated that it will
not be selling Unix as part of the patent sale.</blockquote>

For the past eighteen months, KDE has been my primary desktop. I use it about two-thirds
of the time, with the rest of my desktop usage divided between GNOME, Xfce, and occasionally
other desktops like LXDE. You could call me a generally happy user -- but, as with any
desktop not designed for me personally, KDE has one or two quirks or deficiencies that make
my computing less than ideal. To be sure, KDE has made many improvements since the last time
I complained about its shortcomings, in 2008.</blockquote>

We recently gave you a brief history of viruses on the Mac and as requested by a user we
wanted to give you a history of viruses on Linux. Given the tight security integrated into
Linux, it is difficult to take advantage of a vulnerability on the computer, but some
programmers have found ways around the security measures. There are several free options for
anti-virus on Linux that you really should use, even if it isn't always running - a weekly
or monthly scan doesn't hurt. Free anti-virus solutions include: ClamAV, AVG, Avast and
F-Prot.</blockquote>

announced "openSUSE Tumbleweed."

Greg K-H, as he is commonly known, described openSUSE Tumbleweed as, "a repo that is a
rolling updated version of openSUSE containing the latest "stable" versions of packages for
people to use." In a [post](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2010-11/msg00206.html) to the

Originally [scheduled](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Releases) to arrive on
the 30th of November, the [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/) Project has
confirmed that it plans to ship the eighth beta for version 4 of its open source Firefox web
browser on Tuesday, the 7th of December. According to Mozilla's [Platform Meeting Minutes](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/2010-11-23), the
developers criteria for release for [Firefox 4 Beta 8](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Releases/Firefox_4.0b8) is "no
stability regressions from previous beta". Mozilla says that Firefox 4 Beta 8 will ship at
the same time as Firefox 4 Beta 3 for Mobile devices "in order to align on some sync
changes" and that beta 8 will include stability fixes for graphics, JavaScript optimisations
and various UI fixes related to the Add-ons manager. Based on the [meeting notes](https://wiki.mozilla.org/WeeklyUpdates/2010-11-29#Firefox_4)
from the 29th of November, the eight beta was being held by 29 blocker bugs. At the time of
this writing, that number is [now
18](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=blocking2.0%3Abeta8), two of them rated as critical. (...)</blockquote>
