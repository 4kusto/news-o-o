Participate in the [openSUSE survey 2010](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/6MJYV7T) to give feedback to the openSUSE project about the distribution, the openSUSE tools environment and the project in general. Let us know where things are in good shape and areas where improvement is needed. There are also some questions to get some demographic knowledge about our users. The more we know in which direction our project shall move the better we can address this. The survey will take about 8 mins.
The [survey](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/6MJYV7T) will be online till Feb 28, 2010 and we raffle amongst all participants some t-shirts, openSUSE 11.2 boxes and 1 one really neat device (most probably a [Chumby](http://www.chumby.com)). If you wanna participate in the raffle please provide your email address at the end, if not just skip it.

Have a lot of fun! & Thanks for participating
