## Travel Support


The openSUSE Travel Support Program provides travel sponsorships to individuals who want to attend conferences representing or participating for openSUSE and need financial assistance. This year the team behind the TSP will, working with the conference- and summit teams, facilitate the travel support for our two major events.

Instructions on how to apply and further information about the Travel Support Program and eligibility can be found [here](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Travel_Support_Program)
