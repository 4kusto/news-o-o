    [29.01.2009 16:51] <digitltom> features.opensuse.org updated including vote system :-)


Wow, that was fast. [openfate](http://features.opensuse.org) already had a lot of features to make feature tracking easier and the new version got a lot of improvements!

Let me point out some major new features i like and which are quite visible:



	
  * No login required anymore if you just want to look. Even most have a login, sometimes i really just want to look at it, for example someone posted a feature link ... way faster now! And you can login on the fly: you browse, are not logged in, want to edit it, just login and it will take you back to the page.



	
  * The save button is better visible ... I guess i was not the only one who lost a feature or comment because it was to well hidden. Now it jumps to the save button after you edit your comment, no chance to miss it.



	
  * One feature many people wanted is voting. Yes, it's included and help a lot to see what the users want and where to put more energy in. On the dashboard you can see the top 5 features now. Don't wonder if it's not showing a change after you voted, it has a 5 minute delay, the features itself shows the right count instantly.

	
  * ![voting](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3496/3237053188_821784d228.jpg?v=0)Check also the "Toggle Statistics" link in the voting window. Happy voting!

	
  * Features can be tagged now, and of course there is a nice tag cloud on the dashboard
