![ChameleonBustPosterDraft]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ChameleonBust_white-212x300.png)In about a month, the openSUSE conference will kick off in Thessaloniki, Greece. We expect that about 300 visitors will join us for 4 days featuring over 60 talks, workshops and meetings covering everything from low-level Linux hackery to debating the state of Free Software marketing. Entree to the openSUSE conference is free, as always. Of course, organizing an event like oSC is not exactly without costs, both in terms of hard work and hard cash. For the work we can't thank our volunteer crew enough, and they deserve some attention. So do the sponsors, who help make this event possible, either by providing equipment and services or money. We'd like to introduce the core team and our sponsors to you!<!-- more -->


## The people


An event like oSC is not possible without a dedicated local team. This year, Kostas Koudaras and Stella Rouzi took up the task to lead the efforts for this event. It was them who proposed to do this event almost two years ago; and it was them who gathered and herded a crew of volunteers, created and kept the planning, and were overall awesome each and every day.


## The team

Under the inspiring leadership of Kostas and Stella you can find the openSUSE conference volunteers who have been working on the preparation. This include creating artwork like the logo, flyers, video's and more (Anditosan,Â Pavlos Ratis and Carlos Ribeiro), communication and building and managing websites, writing news articles, social media and spreading the word at events (Henne Volgelsang, Matt Barringer, Theo Chatzimichos, George Bratsos, Pavlos Ratis, Stathis Iosifidis,Â Stathis Agrapidis, Dimitris Papapoulios and Jos Poortvliet) and managing sponsors, money and travel (Izabel Valverde, Agustin Benito Bethencourt). And Jürgen Weigert, who will be in charge of video recording, and Lars Vogdt who will take care of networking, have also been preparing, working with the local team. Of course, we should thank our Paper Committee members: Robert Schweikert, Alberto Planas, Matt Barringer, Michal Hrusecky and Henne. All in random order...

Of course, this is merely a selection of the most active team members - and at the event itself, we'll have even more people join to take care of video taping, networking, hosting rooms, registration and much more. A lot of work goes into an event like this, so if you join, remember to give our volunteers a hug and thank them!


## The sponsors


Without sponsors, oSC wouldn't be possible either. Some support us with equipment, tools or a network connection, others help us manage funds or support our travel support program financially. Let's present our sponsors!
