The next openSUSE Project meeting will take place Wednesday, October 21st, at 16:00 UTC. See all time zones on the [Fixed Time World Clock](http://is.gd/4ro3q). As always, the meeting will be held in IRC on the #opensuse-project channel on Freenode.

Please add topics as soon as possible. Also, if you have questions for the meeting, but can't attend (we know that the meeting times can't work for everyone) please add them to the agenda as well. We also take live questions, of course.
