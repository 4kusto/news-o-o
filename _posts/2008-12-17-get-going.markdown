It's alive! In an effort to bring another joy of contributing to the openSUSE distribution a new team, process and package repository just recently saw the light of day: [openSUSE:Contrib](http://en.opensuse.org/Contrib)

The openSUSE:Contrib repository is an extension of the openSUSE distribution. The goal is simple: making maintainership of packages in the openSUSE distribution possible for everyone. Currently with [openSUSE Factory](http://en.opensuse.org/Factory) it is "only" possible to do code-contribution in the form of patches sent through the [collaboration](http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service/Collaboration) features of the [openSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/). While that is fine it is missing an important motivation bit: responsibility. Having responsibility for a piece of software inside a Linux distribution is a demanding but rewarding task and it is also the one task that is essential to the whole distribution business because that's what a distribution is, a collection of packages. No matter if you create a nice desktop wallpaper or hack on a system service, if you want it to end up on the distribution you have to squeeze it into a package and use the whole process around that. With openSUSE:Contrib it is now possible for everyone to do that for the openSUSE distributions. So if you have experience in RPM packaging and you miss a piece of software in the openSUSE distribution join the openSUSE:Contrib team to scratch that itch. For starters you should read the openSUSE:Contrib [wiki page](http://en.opensuse.org/Contrib) and subscribe yourself to the openSUSE:Contrib [mailing list.](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-contrib) See you around!
