[SUSE's partnership with EQT](https://www.suse.com/company/history/) started last year - and now 
SUSE starts to separate more and more services from [MicroFocus](https://www.microfocus.com/).

SUSE and openSUSE are not only cooperating and share code - often enough they also share the 
same services. As result, openSUSE is also affected from some of the separation work which is 
currently going on behind the scenes. 

This weekend, the official bug tracking tool for openSUSE related issues ([https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/))
is one of the targets. The SUSE-IT team is migrating the service together with the bug tracking 
tool for SUSE to new systems in a new location. As the database has been grown over the last 25(!) 
years, the scheduled downtime is covering the whole weekend:

   **Friday (2020-05-08) until Sunday night (2020-05-10)**

But there is currently more on the agenda: the identity management system, also shared between SUSE and
openSUSE, needs to change as well. This IDM change will include at least also a password change 
request for everyone with an "openSUSE" account. 

Note: there is even more coming up with this IDM change that will be covered in separate messages.
