In an effort to make contributing to openSUSE easier, openSUSE News has
moved from being a Wordpress application to a Jekyll static site
developed directly on Github. Now you too can write an article, or a
series of articles, by sending pull requests to the openSUSE/news-o-o
repository.

### How to do it

The repository contains _posts directory, that's where you will upload your
own markdown formatted post, following the structure of other posts in
the folder. Additionally, you can upload your images to assets/images
directory, and reference them from the post.

After you pull request a post like that, the marketing team will review
and, if needed, suggest improvements. A successfully reviewed post will
be merged into the repository and published at the date specified by the
post itself.
