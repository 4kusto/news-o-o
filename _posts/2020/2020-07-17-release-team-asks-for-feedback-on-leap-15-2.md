The [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) release team is would like feedback from users, developers and stakeholders about the release of the of community-developed [openSUSE Leap 15.2](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:15.2) through a survey.

The survey is available at [https://survey.opensuse.org](https://survey.opensuse.org/). 

[openSUSE Leap 15.2](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:15.2) was released on July 2. Two weeks of people installing the release and using it is a good timeframe to capture fresh ideas and thoughts about how people felt about the release. The survey centers on these two questions: what went well and what didn't go well?

That is the question the release team is asking of those who installed and used [openSUSE Leap 15.2](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:15.2). 

The team hopes the feedback will provide enough information to help improve the release processes and other elements people found important.

The survey will close on August 4.
