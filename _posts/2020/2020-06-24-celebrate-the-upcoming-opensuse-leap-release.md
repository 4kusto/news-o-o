Having a party to celebrate an achievement is rewarding and the openSUSE community knows how to party; and get things done. This is no exception during the time of the pandemic.  

A release party is in order for the general availability of [openSUSE Leap 15.2](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:15.2).  Celebrate the release the way you like and while doing so help promote the release.

openSUSE members can join and/or create a room to hang out with other members of the community to celebrate the release. There are already a couple planned for July 2. Just visit the [launch party wiki](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Launch_parties) and select or add a release party. While this list is mostly virtual, some people might be close enough to meet up for a physical party. In which case, they should add it to the list. People can also get creative make the parties purposeful like creating one room as a social media posting party. 

We encouraging people to take photos and/or screenshot of their virtual release party and share it on social media with the slogan "#openSUSE is for everyone!” Make something like an openSUSE cupcake or print out one of the [beer labels ](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Beer) and put it on a bottle of whatever you’re drinking. "Bring Back Old Toad!" :-) Use Gimp or Inkscape to make something and have a lot of fun doing it.

We are also encouraging people to send a short video about "how I use openSUSE" or "why I use openSUSE" and send it to ddemaio@suse.com, so the videos can be edited and shared online. A five to 30 second clip is ideal.
