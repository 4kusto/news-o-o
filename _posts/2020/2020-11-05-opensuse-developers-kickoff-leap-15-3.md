Members of the [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org) community are separated by great distances, but that didnâ€™t keep them from coming together virtually on Nov. 4 to kickoff the development of the next release;[openSUSE Leap 15.3](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:15.3)!
Several people attended the kickoff, which lasted a couple hours, and the kickoff started with a [video from Release Manager Lubos Kocman](https://youtu.be/NMlW1YavP9Y).
The kickoff video shared some news about the development and shared the [Roadmap](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Roadmap).

Leap 15.3 follows the same setup established in the [Open Build Service](https://openbuildservice.org/) for the openSUSE prototype [Jump](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Jump), which is a new way for building the community distribution using [SUSE Linux Enterprise](https://www.suse.com/products/server/) sources and binaries to make the distributions virtually alike.

Members of the [release team](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Release_team) attended and many aspects of the new development model were clarified for those who attended.

Questions from package maintainers and people with use cases were addressed. 

The group of developers discussed topics like parallel versions of package, marketing of the release, bug tracking, tools and a new soft launch of the Open Source software code hosting system [Pagure](https://code.opensuse.org/) tool used by [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/), which was recently integrated into openSUSE infra.
