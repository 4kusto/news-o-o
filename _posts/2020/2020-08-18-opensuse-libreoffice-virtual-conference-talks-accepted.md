Talks submitted for the [openSUSE + LibreOffice Virtual Conference](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSLO) have been reviewed and accepted by the conference organizers. 

The approved talks have been updated in the [Open Source Event Manager](https://osem.io/) instance on [events.opensuse.org](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSLO). 

The organizers thank everyone who took the time and effort to submit a talk for the conference. 

Speakers have until Sept. 6 to confirm their talk/s for the conference on [events.opensuse.org](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSLO). Speakers will need to login, click on My Proposals and will have an option to confirm the accepted proposal. There is also a withdraw proposal option. 

People who have issues logging on to confirm their talk may have not realized the openSUSE went through a migration and users might need to migrate their account following the steps on [https://idp-portal-info.suse.com](https://idp-portal-info.suse.com).

The [events.opensuse.org](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSLO) website is used to manage talk submissions, scheduling of talks and registrations, but there will be an online live conferencing platform where the conference will take place online from Oct. 15. - 17. 

More information will follow in the coming weeks about the tool and how to navigate it. 

Attendees will be able to customize their schedule by adding sessions they would like to participate in once the platform is ready. 

The conference will have technical talks about LibreOffice, openSUSE, open source, cloud, containers and more. Extra time for Questions and Answers after each talk is possible and the talks will be recorded. The conference will schedule frequent breaks for networking and socializing.

Organizers have online, live conference sponsorship packages available. Interested parties should contact ddemaio (at) opensuse.org for more information.
