The [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) [Summit Dublin](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/Dublin) has been canceled due to the cancellation of some talks and the cancellation of the in-person [SUSECON 2020](https://www.susecon.com/) in Dublin. 

Concerns over the developing situation of COVID-19 coronavirus lead to the decision to cancel the [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) [Summit Dublin](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/Dublin) as the venue would have been shared with SUSECON and is no longer available for the summit.

Contact ddemaio (@) opensuse.org if you have any questions concerning the summit.
