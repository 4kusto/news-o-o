Dear Community

On Monday 18 May 2020 at 07:00 UTC, we will switch over all remaining openSUSE services to the new authentication system. At the same time, the openSUSE forums will also move to the new setup in NÃ¼rnberg.

Important:

The change of our authentication system will require you to set a new password for your user account.

[If you have already changed your password for the bugzilla or OBS migration](https://news.opensuse.org/2020/05/09/community-account-migration/), no action - besides using your new password is  needed.

For more details about the changes to the authentication system, its migration status and the re-registration verification, please go to https://idp-portal-info.suse.com.
