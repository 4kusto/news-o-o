It is with great enthusiasm that I announce the [INNOVATORS for openSUSE project](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:INNOVATORS), is an initiative to share projects, articles and news about innovative projects on the openSUSE platform developed by the community and public and private companies.

All information on this wiki is related to innovative projects that use augmented reality technology, artificial intelligence, computer vision, robotics, virtual assistants and any and all innovative technology (in all hardware plataforms ).

This initiative search collaborators for the project, the objective is to show the power of the openSUSE platform in innovative projects. To send suggestions, criticisms or be part of the INNOVATORS openSUSE community, send an email to the administrator Alessandro de Oliveira Faria (A.K.A. CABELO) at the email [cabelo@opensuse.org](mailto:cabelo@opensuse.org).

To inaugurate the openSUSE for INNOVATORS project, we announced the ISOLALERT software created to combat COVID-19 by monitoring social isolation with computer vision. More information [HERE](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:INNOVATORS#Monitoring_social_distance_to_combat_COVID-19)
