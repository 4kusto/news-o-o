[SUSECON Digital 2020](https://reg.susecon2020.com/flow/suse/susecon20/registration/login) starts today and it is free to register and participate in [SUSE](https://www.suse.com/)â€™s premier annual event. 
This year features more than 190 sessions and hands-on training from experts.

There are less than a handful of openSUSE related talks. The first openSUSE related talk is about [openSUSE Kubic](https://kubic.opensuse.org/) and takes place on May 20 at 14:00 UTC. In the presentation, attendees will receive an update about the last year of openSUSE Kubic development and see a demonstration on deploying Kubernetes with Kubic-control on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) 4 cluster. Attendees will see how to install new nodes with YOMI, which is the new Salt-based auto installer that was integrated into Kubic.

The next talk is about open-source licenses. The talk will focus on the legal review app used by SUSE lawyers and the openSUSE Community. The app called Cavil was developed as an open source application to verify the use of licenses in open source software that help lawyers to evaluate risk related to software solutions. The talk scheduled for June 3 at 13:00 UTC will explain the ease of use for the lawyers and how the model significantly increases the throughput of the ecosystem. 

The last openSUSE related talks centers on openSUSE Leap and SUSE Linux Enterprise. The talk will take place on June 10 at 13:30 UTC. Attendees will learn about the relationship between openSUSE Leap and SUSE Linux Enterprise 15, how it is developed and maintained and how to migrate instances of Leap to SLE. 

The event as a whole is a great opportunity for people who are familiar with open-source and openSUSE. People who just want to learn more about the technology free of cost also have a great opportunity to experience the openness of SUSE and the event.
