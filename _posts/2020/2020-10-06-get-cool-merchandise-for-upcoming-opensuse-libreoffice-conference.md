We’ll have talks, presentations, keynotes, tutorials and much more – [see the full schedule](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSLO/schedule) for all the details.

And there’s more: we’ve got merchandise too! [Get prepared for the conference](https://shop.spreadshirt.de/documentfoundation/) with a T-shirt, hoodie, bag or baseball cap, and help to support The Document Foundation, the non-profit entity behind LibreOffice.

We look forward to seeing you at the conference!
