[![label_for-print]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/label_for-print-150x150.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/label_for-print.png)[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2015/) is here once again and [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/en/) will be there for all the madness that will take place next Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

Geekos will discuss everything you want to know about [Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed), [Factory](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Factory), [YaST](http://yast.github.io/), [Open Build Service](http://openbuildservice.org/), [openQA](https://openqa.opensuse.org/) and more. The openSUSE community will be there in full force to present to and develop with the open-source community.

On Sunday, Feb. 1 between 10:35 and 11:25 a.m., come see Stephan Kulow explain [the development process and tools used to turn openSUSE Factory into Tumbleweed](https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/the_tumbleweed_factory/); if you are a distribution integrators, you won't want to miss it.

<!-- more -->There will be plenty of swag and a specialty German brew from the beer capital of the world at the openSUSE booth to cure your weekend hangover(s).

FOSDEM is free and our openSUSE beer is 1â‚¬ so there is no excuse not to come see us and talk shop or talk about beer; we'll have experts in both at our booth.

The buses will leave Nuremberg at 11 a.m. sharp on Friday, Jan. 30, for the event, so don't be late otherwise you might need to rely on your thumb to get you to Brussels. The return trip to Nuremberg will leave FOSDEM at 6:30 p.m. and get everyone back home just in time for the kickoff of the SuperBowl.

Anyone who has not confirmed they have a seat on the bus should contact [mhaefner@suse.de](mailto:mhaefner@suse.de).

See you at FOSDEM next week!
