openSUSE 11.0 was released on 19th of June 2008 and was planned to be under security maintenance for two years. Upon multiple requests from the community, the SUSE Security and Maintenance Team has decided to extend the maintenance period of openSUSE 11.0 until openSUSE 11.3 release, which is scheduled for July 15th 2010.




We will stop handling new requests at that day and plan to finish with the last update on July 21st 2010 to assure that openSUSE 11.0 users have a smooth upgrade path to openSUSE 11.3. Special thanks to [Dirk Mueller](http://en.opensuse.org/User:Dirkmueller) who innitiated this.
