openSUSE 11.0 was released on 19th of June 2008 and was planned to beÂ under security maintenance for two years.Â Upon multiple requests from theÂ community, the SUSE Security and Maintenance Team has decided to extend theÂ maintenance period of openSUSE 11.0 until openSUSE 11.3 release, which isÂ scheduled for July 15th 2010.




We willÂ stop handling new requests at that day and plan to finish with the lastÂ update on July 21st 2010 to assure that openSUSE 11.0 users have a smoothÂ upgrade path to openSUSE 11.3.Â Special thanks toÂ [Dirk Mueller](http://en.opensuse.org/User:Dirkmueller) who innitiated this.
