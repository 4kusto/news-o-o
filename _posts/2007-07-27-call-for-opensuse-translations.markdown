There have been several requests from community members on the mailing lists to join language teams for the languages Brazilian Portuguese, German, French, Italian, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Spanish and Traditional Chinese.  We have now decided to open up the translation process completely and not put any restrictions on it.  Therefore I invite you to create language teams for those eight languages mentioned above, join one of the existing teams or start a new language team for a language we currently do not support.  If you're interested, please mail on the opensuse-translation mailing list which team you like to create - or join!

<!-- more -->We currently have 55 languages - and I would like to thank everybody nvolved with these.  It's impressive to see those translations, specially for those languages where I would not directly expect that any openSUSE users!  **Thanks a lot!**

Additionally I propose to have during the installation slide show a slide with the following content:


        openSUSE Localization




        The openSUSE project is a community project and many individuals are involved in bug fixing, packaging, testing, documentation and also localization.  Localization for openSUSE specific software is done by different language teams and the localization portal is reachable  under http://i18n.opensuse.org/ .


Each translation teams should then add a new sentence to this parargraphwith e.g. in German "Die deutsche Ãbersetzung wurde durchgeführt von Karl Eichwalder und Andreas Jaeger " (translated back to English: "The German translation has been done by Karl Eichwalder and Andreas Jaeger" - assuming Karl and myself did the work).

What do you think about this?  Should we add this slide? Should we do it differently?

We're a little bit late with this announcement - sorry about that.  We will try to stretch every deadline to get localized packages into 10.3 and especially Karl Eichwalder and Stephan Kulow will help you to move this forward!
