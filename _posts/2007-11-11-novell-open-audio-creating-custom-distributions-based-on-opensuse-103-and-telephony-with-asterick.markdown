As part of their openSUSE release series, Novell Open Audio [has talked to](http://www.novell.com/feeds/openaudio/?p=185) Jan-Christoph Bornschlegel and Stephan Kulow about [KIWI](http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service/KIWI), openSUSEâ„¢s operating system imaging solution. They talk about how you can create a customized distro, USB and preload images, and how it was used to create the openSUSE 10.3 Live-CDs. In the second part Reinhard Max describes Asterisk, an open source telephony engine and tool kit, where to find packages for openSUSE and its usage within Novell.
