281 contributors from the openSUSE community participated in a survey last month. The survey was part of a research project on the topic of firm-sponsored open source communities, hosted by the University of Oslo. Topics in the survey include:





  * level of contribution


  * reasons for participating


  * attitude towards Novell



The results are now ready and can be found here:



  * [Commented version](//folk.uio.no/janfst/ny/contributer_survey_commented_results_2.pdf)


  * [Simple presentation](//folk.uio.no/janfst/ny/contributor_survey_raw_data.pdf)



The commented version includes some analysis of the results and statistical measures of correlation between questions in the survey. The simple version only shows the distribution of frequencies in percent, but also includes the answers to the open text fields in the survey.
