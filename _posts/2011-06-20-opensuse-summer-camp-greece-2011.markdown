Summer in Greece!  Is the weather too hot for you to code or contribute to your favorite FOSS project? Do you need some motivation and a refreshing swim? Come to our Summer Camp!

The Greek openSUSE community is organizing its first openSUSE Summer Camp, in central Greece at Grand Platon Hotel at Olympiaki akti. This is is the beach of the city of Katerini. The doors will be open from the 15th to the 17th of July 2011, at the Heart of Summer!


## Sounds awesome, I'll book my tickets.


So, you’ll be there. What can you expect?

Our goal is to bring FOSS communities closer and encourage people to contribute to their favorite projects.

A lot of people, with little to a lot of experience can benefit from the workshops included in our program, during which we will work on things like translation, wiki usage, coding, packaging and much more, showing how to work inside a community and how to collaborate with others!


## Hmmm. But I could go swimming...


There will be relaxing and swimming of course! But hey, we have a common passion, don't we?

We love what we do, we are having fun contributing to FOSS and we hate doing it alone in our rooms during Summer time.  Besides coding, translating and all other ‘working stuff’ there will also be plenty of sun and beach, a large swimming pool and plenty of beers -  all paid by you since we only sponsor the sun, the fun and all the other free stuff...

We are looking forward to seeing you at the openSUSE Summer Camp Greece!
