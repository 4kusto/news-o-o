The [openSUSE-Education](//en.opensuse.org/Education) project has been setup to support schools and universities using openSUSE. The project will create additional software packages, additional installation repositories and give community based support.





The [project members](//en.opensuse.org/Education/Team) would like to invite everyone interested to the next IRC-Meeting in [**#opensuse-edu**](irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-edu) on Tuesday
  

  

 **2007/11/27 18:00 CET (17:00 GMT)**


<!-- more -->



The first steps already done:




  * The project has two [Build Service projects](//en.opensuse.org/Education/Development) for packagers and testers containing packages for desktop and server applications.


  * First online repositories for 10.2 and 10.3 containing [tons of software](//en.opensuse.org/Education/Applications) are already available at [openSUSE-Education.org/download/repo/](//www.opensuse-education.org/download/repo/). The current state can be found in the [Edu-CD Roadmap](//en.opensuse.org/Education/Development/Edu-CD/Roadmap). The Education-Team asks everybody to test the applications in these repositories and enter bugs in their own bugzilla at [//bugs.opensuse-education.org](//bugs.opensuse-education.org).


  * Well structured wiki pages and [communication plattforms](//en.opensuse.org/Education/Communicating) should help new users to get a fast overview.



More details can be found on the project's [Wiki pages](//en.opensuse.org/Education)
