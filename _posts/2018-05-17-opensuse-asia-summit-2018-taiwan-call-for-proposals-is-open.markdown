![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/osas18-300x67.png)openSUSE.Asia Committee calls for proposals of talks for [openSUSE.Asia Summit 2018](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/summitasia18) held at National Taiwan University of Science and Technology on August 11 and 12.  We might have community day on 10th August before the summit.

openSUSE.Asia Summit is one of the great events for openSUSE community (i.e., both contributors, and users)  in Asia. Those who usually communicate online can get together from all over the world, talk face to face, and have fun.  Members of the community will share their most recent knowledge, experiences, and learn FLOSS technologies surrounding openSUSE.

This event at Taipei is the fifth in openSUSE.Asia Summit. Following the first Asia Summit in Beijing 2014. The past Asia Summits have had participants from China, Taiwan, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, and etc.

This time we co-host with COSCUP and GNOME.Asia, COSCUP is an annual conference held by Taiwanese open source community since 2006. It is a major force of free software movement advocacy in Taiwan. The event is often held with talks, sponsor and communities booths, and Birds of a feather. In addition to international speakers, many Taiwanese local open source contributors often give their talks here. The chief organizer, staffs, and speakers are all volunteers.

COSCUP's aim is providing a platform to connect open source coders, users, and promoters, and promote FLOSS with the annual conference. The conference is free to attend because of the enthusiastic sponsors and donator. In 2017, there are around 1,800 attendees, and we plan to invite more than 2,000 people join COSCUP × openSUSE.Asia Summit × GNOME.Asia Summit this year.
