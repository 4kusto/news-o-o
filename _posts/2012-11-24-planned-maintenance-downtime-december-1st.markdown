**Update: all services are back - please report issues via mail to admin @ opensuse.org**

On Saturday, **December 1st 2012**, at approximately **05:00 UTC** our data center team will do a backend storage upgrade. The planned window is **8-10 hours** for the maintenance, and specific applications will probably be not available until 24:00 UTC as listed below.

  * [Novell Open ID](http://www.novell.com/communities/node/8951/novell-accessmanager-authentication-class-openid-authentication) for [SUSE Studio](http://susestudio.com/)


The plan is to keep read only versions of each affected site running. We will keep this announcement updated with the current state and also report changes to opensuse-announce@opensuse.org.

To avoid confusion - the services listed below are not scheduled for any downtime and accordingly **up for the whole time**:
