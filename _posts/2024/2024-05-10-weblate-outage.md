The [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) will undergo a critical update with the migration of [Weblate](https://l10n.opensuse.org/) to a hosted solution. 


Shifting to a hosted solution for the web-based localization tool in order to keep up with the increasing demands of projectsâ€™ development.


The migration is slated for May 14 and it is anticipated that the service will be down for approximately one day. 

This is a planned short-term inconvenience for a long-term benefit and will allow for our translation contributors to pick up right where they left off.


People wanting to contribute to the openSUSE Project by helping to translate using [Weblate](https://weblate.org/en/) can register on https://l10n.opensuse.org and connect with other translators through [translation@lists.opensuse.org](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/translation@lists.opensuse.org/) and [project@lists.opensuse.org](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/project@lists.opensuse.org/) mailing lists.


Any attempt to connect to Weblate during the migration will trigger a notification informing the user of the ongoing maintenance. Others will be informed of the outage through https://status.opensuse.org.
