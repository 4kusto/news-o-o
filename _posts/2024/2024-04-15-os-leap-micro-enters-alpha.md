The [openSUSE project](https://opensuse.org/) is excited to announce that [Leap Micro 6](https://get.opensuse.org/leapmicro/6.0/) is in its alpha development stage. 

Building on the solid foundation of its predecessors, Leap Micro 6 continues to provide a stable, secure and scalable platform for modern lightweight host operating systems that mirrors features and enhancements of SUSEâ€™s commercial [SL Micro](https://www.suse.com/products/micro/) release. 

With the upcoming release of Leap Micro 6, users of Leap Micro 5.4 will need to plan their migration either to Leap Micro 5.5, directly to Leap Micro 6 or a commercial version, as version 5.4 will reach end-of-life upon the launch of Leap Micro 6. Those currently on Leap Micro 5.5 will have the option to upgrade to version 6 or remain on 5.5 until the subsequent release.

Users familiar with Leap Micro 5.5 will remember its standout features, such as enhanced SELinux capabilities, improved podman-docker and Hyper-V support for AArch64, which have significantly bolstered the security and versatility of the operating system.
