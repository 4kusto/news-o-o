The [schedule for openSUSE Conference 2024](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC24/schedule/events) is out and it is filled with several talks about open-source ecosystem and includes several breaks for networking opportunities. 

Open-source enthusiasts, developers and contributors will meet at the Z-Bau from June 27 to June 29 to share, discuss and showcase the latest advancements in open-source technologies, projects and communities.
The conference will feature a series of talks, workshops, meetups and keynote speakers providing valuable insights into current and future directions of open-source software.

Santiago Zarate, Oliver Kurz, and Livdywan are scheduled to kick off with a session on [openQA - Current State and Moving Forward](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC24/program/proposals/4450). The talk will highlight the evolution of [openQA](http://open.qa/) as a crucial tool for ensuring the stability of openSUSE's systems and expanding its impact beyond [openSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org/), [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/) and [SUSE](https://www.suse.com/).

Marcus Meissner and Johannes Segitz will present [The XZ Backdoor - Report from Our Side](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC24/program/proposals/4498) and provide a retrospective on a significant supply chain attack involving the xz compression library. They will discuss the attack's impact, response measures and future security considerations.

Two keynotes will take place on the first day. SUSE’s CEO Dirk-Peter van Leeuwen will speak about the [importance of community](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC24/program/proposals/4638) and fostering collaborative open-source environments.

Luca Di Maio will provide a keynote session on [Developing on Aeon with Distrobox](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC24/program/proposals/4593). The presentation will introduce Distrobox and demonstrate how it can be used as a development environment within Atomic and Transactional systems like [Aeon](https://aeondesktop.github.io/).

The second day is scheduled to begin with Alfonso Hernandez's [Midori is Much More Than a Web Browser](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC24/program/proposals/4483) talk. Hernandez will explore the features and benefits of Midori, a lightweight, fast and secure browser, and its role in promoting user privacy and security.

Jsrain will provide a [SUSE ALP: State of the Matters](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC24/program/proposals/4441) talk. The session will cover recent developments, upcoming releases and how the openSUSE project can build on SUSE’s ALP development.

Rick Spencer, General Manager at SUSE, will deliver another keynote. His talk [Why openSUSE Matters](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC24/program/proposals/4363) will share his insights on the significance of openSUSE in the broader open-source ecosystem.

The final day will feature Dan Čermák's [The Tragedy of Community Enterprise Linux Distributions](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC24/program/proposals/4533). Čermák will discuss the challenges faced by community variants of enterprise Linux distributions and propose potential solutions.

Markus Feilner will present [Exchange Your Exchange: grommunio - An Open Source Drop-In and So Much More](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC24/program/proposals/4620) and highlight [grommunio](https://grommunio.com/) as a comprehensive open-source replacement for Microsoft Exchange, which offers groupware, video conferencing, chat, file sync and more.

A [Fedora Hatch Meetup](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC24/program/proposals/4539), led by Čermák, will provide an informal space for Fedora contributors and enthusiasts to discuss their experiences and network.
