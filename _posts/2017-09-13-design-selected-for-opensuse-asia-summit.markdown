![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/opensuse-asia-17-logo-red-216x300.png)Thank you for designing great logos and helping us to choose one from them.

As a result of the final vote, two candidates tied for the first place. openSUSE.Asia Summit Committee discussed which one should be this year’s logo.

The committee decided to use the fantastic work designed by Ramadoni Ashudi. The theme of the logo is Sakura (cherry blossoms) — a flower representing Japan. Moreover, the silhouette of cherry blossoms and Geeko are placed on Japanese flag.

Congratulations, Ramadoni! He will receive “Geeko Mystery Box.” Note that he was also the winner of the competition in 2016. The committee appreciates his continuous contribution.

openSUSE.Asia Summit 2017 is going to take place on October 21–22 at the University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan with 50 speakers coming from countries or regions including Indonesia, Taiwan, China. The committee hopes that many people will be able to join the summit.
