On Sunday the first openSUSE conference  (osc09) finished in Nuernberg, Germany. Overall it was great success and brought people face to face together. Participants were motivated and enthusiastic and we'd like to just show some comments on twitter/blog:



	
  * **"Folks! I'm hoooome! #oSC09 was a blast! More details to come BryenY"**



	
  * **"Back from the #opensuse conference #osc09, back to work. Had a great time"**



	
  * **"Back from the _awesome_ openSUSE #osc09 conference. Learnt a lot. Huge kudos to @zonker !"**



	
  * **"On the train back home from #osc09 was a great event, really nice to meet so many people from the #openSUSE community in person"**



	
  * **"In the train back to Stuttgart after 4 great days at the openSUSE conference. Great progress on all fronts. #osc09"**



	
  * **"great #osc09 event. I've decided to give #openSUSE the whole disk on my laptop! And i want to contribute, contribute, contribute!"**


We had overall around 225 persons from all over the world attending.  For those who couldn't make it to the conference we'll try to publish all presentations and videos if available. A lot of people from Novell's  Nuernberg and Prague offices showed up -  sometimes only for a few hours - which shows that Nuernberg was the  right location for this event.  Novell VPs and Directors that showed  up include Carlos Montero-Luque, Ralf Flaxa, Gerald Pfeifer and Roland  Haidl.

The whole four days we had two tracks of talks and two tracks of  ad-hoc conference sessions on a variety of topics incl. moblin,  appliances, desktop, quality, community, toolchain and system, and legal. Some sessions to point out where:

	
  * **team meetings of GNOME and KDE developers, incl. a common meeting**



	
  * ** the governance sessions (see below)**



	
  * ** Keynotes by Lenz Grimmer on "working in a virtual community" and Gianugo Rabellino on "Open Development in the trenches: a decade at the Apache Software Foundation"**



	
  * ** Stefan Werden announcing that he's taking over the openSUSE retail Box business**


Thursday evening we had a great party at the Novell offices and Friday  and Saturday night a local cinema was presenting the "Creative Common  Film night".

We were impressed by the many discussions that formed and the ad-hoc  conference sessions set up and the many groups gathered in the hall ways and pretty productively covered a certain topic. We'd like also point out a night time  session on Friday night (until 3:30am) where more than 10 people  triaged through  GNOME bugs for openSUSE (incl. checking whether they are  still valid) and hacked on GNOME features like Bacon (banshee UI for Moblin) and Zeitgeist (GNOME 3.0).

**Governance
**We had two sessions on how governance in the project does work today  and what needs to be changed. Currently most of the decisions are done by  experts in their area, the open question is what kind of process is  needed in case area experts cannot make a decision. We have  decided to move forward in the following way: A small group will now  discuss this further together with the board, create a first proposal  for public comments and once we have a good proposal, the openSUSE  members will vote on this change.

**RPM Summit
**We had an RPM summit which Florian Festi (upstream RPM developer  emplyoed by Red Hat) joined. Goal was to work on RPM itself to  unify RPM usage between openSUSE and Fedora - the end goal is that a  valid spec file for openSUSE or SLE is also valid for Fedora/Red Hat  and vice versa.

**Software Freedom**
Saturday we had a track in German as part of the world wide Software  Freedom day which was targeted to people new to Linux. We had pretty many interesting and supporting conversation with  some participants that came just for this day. Most interesting to AJ  was an incident at the rather big local farmer market in the morning where a person said  "Today I go to Software Freedom day". And AJ recognized this person later that day at the conference.

**Journalists & Media**

Ulrike Beringer made it happen that 11 journalists attended  the conference and  had several interviews at the conference with Joe Brockmeier, Michael Meeks  and Andreas Jaeger.

Comment from our PR agency was: "The feedback of the journalists  was very positive, as you can see in the report some of them even  published several articles at once. Hence from our PR perspective the  event was a big success!" RadioTux interviewed various participants for podcasts of more than 90  minutes.

Thanks to Ulrike for setting this up!
