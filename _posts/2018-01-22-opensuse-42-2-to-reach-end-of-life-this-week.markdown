![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Leap-green-254x300.png)The minor release of [openSUSE Leap 42.2](https://news.opensuse.org/2016/11/16/optimal-release-for-linux-professionals-arrives-with-opensuse-leap-42-2/) will reach its [End-of-Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-life_(product)#Computing) (EOL) this week on Jan. 26.

The EOL phase ends the updates to the operating system, and those who continue to use EOL versions will be exposed to vulnerabilities because these discontinued versions no longer receive security and maintenance updates; this is why users need to upgrade to the newer minor; [openSUSE Leap 42.3](https://news.opensuse.org/2017/07/26/refresh-of-linux-distribution-continues-leveraging-community-enterprise-benefits/).

“We are very pleased with the reliability, performance and longevity of Leap,” said openSUSE member Marcus Meissner. “Both the openSUSE community and SUSE engineers have done a fantastic job with security and maintenance of the Leap 42 distribution; users can be confident that their openSUSE operating system is, and will continue to be, receiving bug fixes and maintenance updates until its [End-of-Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-life_(product)#Computing).”

Leap [42.3](https://news.opensuse.org/2017/07/26/refresh-of-linux-distribution-continues-leveraging-community-enterprise-benefits/) was released on July 26, 2017 and users were expected to upgrade from Leap [42.2](https://news.opensuse.org/2016/11/16/optimal-release-for-linux-professionals-arrives-with-opensuse-leap-42-2/) within 6 months of 42.3’s release.

[Leap 42.2](https://news.opensuse.org/2016/11/16/optimal-release-for-linux-professionals-arrives-with-opensuse-leap-42-2/) was released in November of 2016. Its support life cycle of 42.2 has given users several months of maintenance.

The major release of the Leap 42 series has so far provided a support life cycle of 27 months and is expected to last until early 2019; when openSUSE Leap 42.3 will reach its EOL. That gives the major version of Leap 42 more than 36 months of life-cycle support. However, the EOL for the Leap 42 series is dependent on the release of the next major version, which will be [openSUSE Leap 15](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Roadmap) and it’s expected to be released later this Spring.
