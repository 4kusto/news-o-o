Due to the [unforeseen circumstances of last week](//news.opensuse.org/2008/10/10/power-outage-in-area-where-most-opensuse-servers-are-located/) the Board Election Committee have agreed that for fairness and transparency the Election deadline will be extended.  The new closing date for polls will now be [1200UTC Saturday 25th October](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=25&month=10&year=2008&hour=12&min=0&sec=0&p1=0).

As it stands now, over 57% of votes have been cast.  Hopefully the extension will enable all voters the chance to have their voice heard. Remember, this is the community's chance to influence the governance of the openSUSE project.  If you don't vote your chance to influence the project will be reduced.  If you have questions about the [candidates](http://en.opensuse.org/Board_Election/2008/Platforms), ask them.  They won't bite, but they may be able to give you the answers to enable you to vote with a clearer consience.
