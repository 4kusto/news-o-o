![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/osc18-300x214.png)The [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) Project is pleased to announce that it is accepting proposals for openSUSE Conference 2020. The Call for Hosts will be open until April 15, 2019.

The openSUSE Conference Organizational Team will review the submissions with the hopes of having a decision announced about the location of oSC20 at the [openSUSE Conference 2019](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC19) in Nuremberg, Germany. Community members and open-source enthusiasts are encouraged to follow the [Conference How To](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_How_to) guide on the wiki to submit a proposal on hosting the conference. The guide offers a [How to Bid](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_How_to_bid) and [How to Checklist](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_How_to_Check_List) to help with submitting a proposal.

The proposals will need to be submitted to the openSUSE Marketing mailing list and the openSUSE Conference Organizational Team will discuss the proposals as it plans this yearâ€™s conference.

While the [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) Project intends to move the conference to different worldwide locations in the future, the project has two locations (Nuremberg, Germany, and Prague, Czech Republic) to host the annual community conference if no proposals are submitted during the Call for Hosts.

More venue information

 	
  * Main auditorium: The main room needs to hold a bit more than the expected attendees and is used for keynotes, this room should normally take about 200 people.



 	
  * Smaller rooms: 1-3 smaller rooms are needed for talks. These rooms usually need to hold 50-100 people, depending on the number of tracks. We often use the main auditorium for one of these and schedule the more popular talks to take place in there.



 	
  * Hacking/meeting areas: People like to hack, meet and talk during breaks or when they are not watching a talk. It is good to have a foyer with tables, chairs, plugs and wired internet and one room for quieter meetings (big enough for 40 people), but a number of rooms will do if there is no open space available.



 	
  * Press room: Press need a quiet room where they can go to write up their reports.



 	
  * Staff room: Your volunteers will need to chill. This can also be a safe place for them to lock up their valuables.



 	
  * Sponsors' room: Be sure to ask sponsors if they need a room to use for storing promotional material, meetings, celebrations, etc.


It is best to set up the merchandise stand, information desk and auditoriums the day before the conference starts.
