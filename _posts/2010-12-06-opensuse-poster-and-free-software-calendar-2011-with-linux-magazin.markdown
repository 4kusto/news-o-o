Ladies and Gentlemen![![](/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Old-Toad-Poster-2.png)](//news.opensuse.org/2010/12/06/opensuse-poster-and-free-software-calendar-2011-with-linux-magazin/old-toad-poster-2/)

The Januari edition of the German [Linux-Magazin](//www.linux-magazin.de) this year will feature something this Magazine has not featured for almost 10 years: a Free Software Event calendar. Sponsored by SUSE, this calendar features many of the upcoming Free Software events in 2011 mingled with interesting tidbits about Linux and Unix history! While this geeky piece of paper (offering the date & time of events in unix time) is cool, the back offers an even more exciting layer of ink: Beer! Our very own Robert Lihm, openSUSE artist Extra-Ordinaire has taken a picture of [the famous "Old Toad" beer](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Beer), featured at the openSUSE conference. Uttering the infamous words "A good beer is a good beer", he decided this would form a good foundation for a poster. Hence, everyone who gets his or her hands on this first 2011 edition of Linux-Magazin can use the back of this Calendar to show how much beer and openSUSE go together (read more [about the beer](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Beer)).

The Linux-Magazin folks have also thought about those for whom German is not a first language - they have made an English translation of the Calendar and the graphics for both Calendar and Poster are available on the openSUSE wiki for re-print under liberal licensing terms - the magazine is for sale now, get it or just [download and print the calendars and of course the awesome poster](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Marketing_materials#Folders_and_leaflets)! For the poster we hope to have sources online soon, if you want them now, ask Robert Lihm!
