The openSUSE Project is happy to announce the second milestone release for openSUSE 11.2 [is ready for download](http://software.opensuse.org/developer). This release includes Firefox 3.5 beta 4, KDE 4.3 beta 1, GNOME 2.26, and hundreds of other updates from [Milestone 1](http://news.opensuse.org/2009/04/24/opensuse-112-milestone-1-released/).

This is a **Milestone Release**, which means that it may not be suitable for production systems. This is one in a [series](http://en.opensuse.org/Roadmap) of releases leading to the official openSUSE 11.2 release, scheduled for November 2009.

Screenshots of the 11.2 Milestone 2 release [are available on the wiki](http://en.opensuse.org/Screenshots/11.2_Milestones).

## Testing


Help us make openSUSE 11.2 the best release yet! Please run the release through your usual routine, and let us know about any bugs or other issues that you find. Remember that this is a milestone release, and is not suitable for use on production systems.

Though many openSUSE users can and do use the Factory distribution and/or testing releases for day-to-day work we want to stress that itâ€™s entirely possible that you will encounter serious bugs. See [openSUSE.org/Testing](http://en.opensuse.org/Testing) for more information on Testing. To follow the testing and development process, we suggest that you subscribe to the openSUSE-Factory mailing list, and join the #openSUSE-Factory channel on Freenode to discuss openSUSE development.
