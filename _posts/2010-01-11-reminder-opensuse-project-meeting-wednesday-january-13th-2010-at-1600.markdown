The next openSUSE Project meeting will take place Wednesday, January 13, at 16:00 UTC. The meeting time in all time zones are listed on the [Fixed Time World Clock](http://bit.ly/56NvZu). Project meetings are always held in the #opensuse-project channel on Freenode.

Please add your topics to the meeting wiki page at:

[http://en.opensuse.org/Meetings/Project_Meeting_1010-01-13](http://en.opensuse.org/Meetings/Project_Meeting_1010-01-13)

Please add topics as soon as possible. Also, if you have questions for the meeting, but can’t attend (we know that the meeting times can’t work for everyone) please add them to the agenda as well. We also take live questions, of course. Logs of the meeting are posted to the wiki here:
