**Update:** The migration of the openSUSE Mailing Lists has been finished successfully. If you encounter any issues, please let us know by mail to [admin@opensuse.org](mailto:admin@opensuse.org).


On Tuesday 2015-06-09, from 09:00 to 11:00 UTC, the machine that hosts the
[openSUSE Mailing Lists](//lists.opensuse.org/) will be offline. During that
time, sending or receiving mails to the  openSUSE mailing lists, or viewing
their archives will not be possible.  All the mails that will be sent during
the downtime will be  delayed.
[![Failgeeko](/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Failgeeko.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Failgeeko.png)
The  reason is that the old machine is on an old distribution, and running  out
of resources. We will migrate the service to a new virtual machine,  that will
integrate it to a new configuration management infrastructure.

We'll send a followup announcement with the final status as soon as we finish
the migration.

On behalf of the openSUSE Administration team
