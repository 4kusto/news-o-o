**What is The Different?**

_Starting this year, openSUSE.Asia organization committee are accepting proposals earlier for better preparation and well organized summit. This rule will be also applied for future summits. The guides for openSUSE.Asia Summit can be reached at _[_https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Asia_Summit_](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Asia_Summit)

The openSUSE.Asia Summit is the largest annual openSUSE conference in Asia, attended by contributors and enthusiasts from all over Asia. The event focuses primarily on the openSUSE distribution, its applications for personal and enterprise use, and open source culture. It brings together the openSUSE community in Asia, providing a forum for users, developers, foundation leaders, governments and businesses to discuss the present technology and future developments.

The Summit’s preference is to find new locations each year as we spread openSUSE throughout Asia, and we are looking for local organizers to rise to the challenge of organizing an excellent openSUSE event. We need individuals and communities to get together and organize a successful openSUSE.Asia Summit. The openSUSE.Asia organization committee assists throughout the process.
