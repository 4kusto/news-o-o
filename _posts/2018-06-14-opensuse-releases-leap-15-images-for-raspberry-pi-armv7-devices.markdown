The release of [openSUSE Leap 15](https://news.opensuse.org/2018/05/25/based-on-enterprise-code-tested-millions-of-times-opensuse-leap-15-released/) two weeks ago is following up with its Build to Scale theme by offering images for [Raspberry Pis](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), [Beagle Boards](https://beagleboard.org/), [Arndale board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arndale_Board), [CuBox-i computers](https://www.solid-run.com/nxp-family/cubox-i/), [OLinuXino](https://www.olimex.com/Products/OLinuXino/open-source-hardware) and more.![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/clear-219x300.png)

openSUSE has plenty of [supported arm boards](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Supported_ARM_boards) to allow makers to simply create. openSUSE is providing makers the tools to start, run and grow a project on micro devices to large hardware.

The new, fresh and hardened code base that supports modern hardware is stable and offers a full scope of deployments.

Makers can leverage [openSUSE Leap 15](https://news.opensuse.org/2018/05/25/based-on-enterprise-code-tested-millions-of-times-opensuse-leap-15-released/) images for aarch64 and Armv7 on Internet of Things (IoT) and embedded devices. Since openSUSE Leap 15 shares a common core  [SUSE Linux Enterprise](https://www.suse.com/products/server/) (SLE) 15 sources, makers who find success with a project or device can more comfortably transition to an enterprise product in the future should certifications become a requirement. Currently, the only IoT platform supported by SLE is the Raspberry Pi 3. However, there is no current supported migration from Leap 15 to SLE 15 with the Raspberry Pi. The barrier to entry in the IoT/embedded markets are lowered when a developer starts a project with Leap 15. Plus, the many [supported arm boards](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Supported_ARM_boards) can help developers circumnavigate future obstacles that might hinder project’s growth in a developing market.

<!-- more -->Leap 15 brings plenty of community packages and developers using [arm boards](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Supported_ARM_boards) who are looking for a specific package should search for it on [https://software.opensuse.org/](https://software.opensuse.org/) or use [zypper](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Zypper).

The Armv7 images for [NanoPi NEO](http://wiki.friendlyarm.com/wiki/index.php/NanoPi_NEO), [Beagle Bone](https://beagleboard.org/bone) and others are available at [download.opensuse.org](http://download.opensuse.org/ports/armv7hl/distribution/leap/15.0/appliances/) in Armv7 applications. Raspberry Pi images of openSUSE Leap 15 are available from the static webpage found on the [openSUSE Raspberry Pi Wiki page](https://en.opensuse.org/HCL:Raspberry_Pi3).
