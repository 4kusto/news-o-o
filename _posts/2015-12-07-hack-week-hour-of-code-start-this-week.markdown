Today is the beginning of two week-long events that are both exciting and serve a great purpose.

This week the [Hour of Cod](https://hourofcode.com/de)e begins and the lessons of teaching students to write code is a novel idea. Using Star Wars and the soccer ball looking droid BB-8, students are learning the basics of code worldwide. Touché to the [technical staff of Star Wars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNjiHkQQl6A) for providing lessons for this good cause.

Students aren’t the only ones this week who are having fun and doing experimental coding.We’re doing a [Hack Week](https://hackweek.suse.com/) this week and there are plenty of projects people can contribute to on the Hack Week website. Maybe students who breeze through their Hour of Code lessons would be interested in learning a few of openSUSE’s [Hack Week](https://hackweek.suse.com/) projects.

One of the projects is [learning ruby with betaman](https://hackweek.suse.com/13/projects/1236) submitted by gameboy974. vitezslav_cizek’s project is to [unlock locked devices](https://hackweek.suse.com/13/projects/1224). bamvor’s project is using two ARM 64bit boards and a sensor kit for his project on [openSUSE with Linaro 96 board](https://hackweek.suse.com/13/projects/1206).

One project is even doing some [KDE bugzilla cleanup](https://hackweek.suse.com/13/projects/1160).

Coding is important, but so is documentation. One [Hack Week project](https://hackweek.suse.com/13/projects/1248) is also dedicated to reinforcing this point. There are a list of pages on a [Mozilla etherpad](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/opensuse_wiki) for the [openSUSE wiki](https://en.opensuse.org/) that need to be refreshed and refined.

Join us this week for some hacking and use the [Hack Week](https://hackweek.suse.com/) website and [IRC](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=opensuse-project) for communicating.
