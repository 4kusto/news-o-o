The openSUSE Conference (**oSC**) is the yearly get-together of Â our community to give its people a chance to meet face to face, talk to and inspire each other. Being together in one room, even in this day and age, beats every other collaboration method and is what forges cohesion and friendships. That is why the openSUSE Project tries to get together this conference every year for its contributors. But not only for them, the conference is also for anyone using, working with or taking advantage of the project. No matter if you use our technology, if you are one of our many friends from free and open source upstream projects or if you contribute to another GNU/Linux distribution this conference is for you.

## Going Prague


[![Boat Traffic Under the Prague Castle at Dusk ~ Prague, Czech Republic](http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1285/4681832979_f3f83a5572_z.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/msojka/4681832979/)
After three years of oSC in Nuremberg we are excited to host this years conference in [Prague](http://www.praguewelcome.cz/en/), _"the city of a hundred spires"_. Prague, which is regularly voted among the ten most beautiful cities in Europe, is the capital and with more than 1.2 million inhabitants the largest city in the Czech Republic. The exact location and date isn't set yet but the fourth installment of oSCÂ will not take place in September as usual, but rather at the turn of October and November, because of the precedingÂ [SUSECon](http://www.suse.com/events/susecon/) and [the openSUSE Summit](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Summit).

  



## Make oSC12 your oSC - Participate


Just because the conference isn't until November, it does not mean we can't start planning right way! We have already established a team of folks local to Prague which will help with the on-site organization during the conference, but we still need to form additional teams which will deal with various topics prior the conference. We need for instance a program team which will drive the call for papers and the schedule or the promotion team to come up with a theme for oSC12 together with artwork, banners, badges, T-shirts, etc.

If you would like to participate, please subscribe to the [opensuse-conference@opensuse.org](mailto:opensuse-conference+subscribe@opensuse.org) [mailing list](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-conference/) and read through the [conference wiki portal](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Conference) where we coordinate the organization  We are looking forward to hearing from you!
