The winner of the [_openSUSE_](https://www.opensuse.org/) + [_LibreOffice_](https://www.libreoffice.org/) Conference [_logo competition_](https://news.opensuse.org/2019/09/27/co-conference-logo-competition-for-2020/) is Kukuh Syafaat from Indonesia.

Kukuh’s “Fresh Community Spirit” was the winning design and was one of 10 designs submitted during the competition. “Mystery Box” will be sent to Kukuh for the winning design.

In 2020, [_openSUSE_](https://www.opensuse.org/) and [_LibreOffice_](https://www.libreoffice.org/) will have a shared conference from October 13 – 16 in Nuremberg, Germany_._

The organizing committee for this year’s joint conference selected the winning design during a meeting on Jan. 20. The logo portrayed an ideal fit for the conference since openSUSE and LibreOffice are combining their community conferences for just one year in 2020 to celebrate LibreOffice’s 10-year anniversary and the openSUSE Project’s 15-year anniversary.

Now that the logo has been announced, fliers and posters can be created to help advertise the event. The conference website will soon be available on [events.opensuse.org](https://events.opensuse.org/) and the Call for Papers will begin next month.

This [_openSUSE_](https://www.opensuse.org/) + [_LibreOffice_](https://www.libreoffice.org/) Conference logo should not be confused with the [_LibreOffice 10th anniversary logo_](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/images/6/66/LibO_CommunityAnniversary_10years_300x300.png) announced on the [_LibreOffice blog_](https://blog.documentfoundation.org/).
