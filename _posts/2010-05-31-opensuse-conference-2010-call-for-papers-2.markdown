![openSUSE Conference 2010](http://en.opensuse.org/images/d/d7/Conf2010_300x250px.png)The [openSUSE Project](http://www.opensuse.org) Team is happy to announce that the 2nd international [openSUSE Conference](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference) will take place in Nuremberg, Germany between 20-23 October 2010.

After the great success of the first conference last year we will again meet in Nuremberg to discuss, learn, plan and work on the openSUSE project with all its sub-projects as well as on general free software topics.

Specifically this year we're explicitly inviting members of upstream projects and other community distributions to discuss comprehensive topics of free software and projects to move forward with free technology across borders, which is also the motto of the openSUSE Conference 2010:


**Collaboration Across Borders**





## Call for Papers


The [Conference Program Committee](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_program_committee) is currently seeking submissions from attendees for all kind of contributions to the conference such as talks, tutorials, hands-on-sessions and such. Suggested topics are around the motto of _Collaboration Across Borders_, but it is not a limitation. The [Call for Papers](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_call_for_papers) gives some guidance and concrete examples.

The deadline for this year's [Call for Papers](http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_call_for_papers) is July, 31st 2010. Acceptance will be issued by August, 20th.
