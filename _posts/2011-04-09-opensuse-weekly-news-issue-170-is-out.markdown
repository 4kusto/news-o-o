[Plus Ã§a change, plus c™est la mÃªme chose¦](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/04/06/plus-ca-change-plus-cest-la-meme-chose/)

Or in other words, The more things change, the more they stay the
      same¦

openSUSE does not ship major/minor releases, but our numbering/naming scheme “ NN.X “ has
      led to a common misperception that a .0 release was major and a .x release was an update. This
      created a number of issues, including lack of media attention for .x releases, and user
      misconceptions about stability of .0 releases.

We have traditionally released versions as 11.0, 11.1, 11.2 and so on up to .3. (The
      exception was 11.4 because the Project wasn™t sure what to number the next release.)

The only really clear thing was our release cycle timing, as follows:

**openSUSE releases on a fixed schedule every 8 months no
          matter what. Therefore, all releases occur in November, July and
      March.**

There has been a lot of discussion over time within our community about our versioning
      scheme for distribution releases. We want to ensure our growing community, including users and
      media, have a clear and correct understanding of our release cycle “ so naming or numbering
      needed to reflect that, and not cause misunderstanding.

Recently, the Project took these discussions to a poll, to gauge community feeling about
      the different options. Generally, the community expressed that they wanted a scheme that was
      uniquely openSUSE™s and reflected our release methodology. We looked at other distros for
      examples, and while we felt many had come up with excellent versioning schemes for their
      distros, none properly reflected our own cycle.

From this discussion and results of the poll, we have come up with the following
      scheme:

  * The .x shall henceforth reflect the month of release 

    * 1 = November

    * 2 = July

    * 3 = March

  * We will no longer ship a .0 version.

This solution brings a meaningful rationale to the scheme, without completely revising the
      look. And thus, our next release in November will be 12.1. In July 2012, we will ship 12.2 and
      in March 2013, we will ship 12.3. Then in November 2013, we will ship 13.1.

So as you can see¦ same great versioning look, now with explanation.

[Linux is 20 years
        old!](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/04/08/linux-is-20-years-old/)

We have two birthdays this week!

While on April 6th GNOME 3 was born, another kid became 20 years old! The Linux Foundation
        [celebrates the 20th anniversary of
        Linux](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/20th/) with among other things [a video contest](http://video.linux.com/categories/video-contests/20th-anniversary-linux-video-contest). We [already mentioned it](https://news.opensuse.org/2011/03/25/linux-foundation-20th-anniversary-of-linux-campaign-and-video-contest/) but it™s now time to get those video™s to the Linux
      Foundation!

**Contest**

The video should be 60 second long and celebrate the 20th Anniversary by showing the
      impact of Linux on culture and IT over the last 20 years. The more inspiring you can make it,
      the better!

Youtube: [http://www.youtube.com/v/5ocq6_3-nEw](http://www.youtube.com/v/5ocq6_3-nEw)

The winner of this year™s 20th Anniversary of Linux Video Contest will win airfare,
      registration and hotel expenses to attend one of the following events of their choice: [LinuxCon North America](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon),
        [LinuxCon
        Europe](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon-europe), SXSW 2012 or the LA Film Festival. The winning video will be unveiled at
        [LinuxCon](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon) in Vancouver
      BC August 17-19, 2011.

Ranking is based on community voting with the final decision being made by uber-penguin
      Linus Torvalds himself!

**More**

However, the Linux Foundation does more: all events where they have a booth will have recording equipment where you can record a message and share your favorite Linux moment or talk about the future. There will also be a series of articles on trainings for Linux professionals.

**Join**

We™re surely proud of our Penguin! Join the celebration and visit the [Linux Foundation 20th birthday
        site](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/20th/).

[Kartik Mandaville: Karma Plugin for openSUSEConnect](http://sysbytes.wordpress.com/2011/04/08/karma-plugin-for-opensuse-connect/)

This post is about an idea for GSoC 2011 regarding openSUSE Connect.

**Short Description** : Karma concept in openSUSE Connect
      that will collect points from wiki edits, bugzilla entries, planet.opensuse.org posts,
      distribution changelogs etc and use them in the Connect. Based on Karma, different badges to
      be given. Different categories “ developer karma/marketing karma etc. Also, an option to
      reward/ transfer Karma points to another user in recognition of his work. API to be
      implemented to access/ modify Karma points.

For those of you who have time to read the long description :

So basic idea of this project is to create different kinds of karma and collect as many
      information as possible automatically. So we will have wiki karma that will grow with every
      wiki page edit. We will have marketing karma growing bigger with every tweet and blog post.
      Packager karma getting bigger with every change submitted to the openSUSE. So this project
      will be not only about displaying and managing karma points but also about collecting
      statistics from various different services. (...)

          [Sebastian Kügler: Plasma Active “ A Desirable User Experience Encompassing the Device Spectrum](http://vizzzion.org/blog/2011/04/plasma-active-a-desirable-user-experience-encompassing-the-device-spectrum/)
        

Today, I™d like to announce to a wider audience a project we have been working on in
          and beyond the Plasma team. Its goal is to **Create a desirable user
            experience encompassing a spectrum of devices**, and it is called **Plasma Active**. A couple of things make Plasma Active special.
          First, the driver is the desirable user experience.
          That means that we want to create something, people want, and people want to use. It means
          we are less technology-focused, but are taken a user-centered approach. Second, we are not
          targeting a single device, or a narrowly-defined class of devices. Plasma Active is made
          to run on a spectrum of devices that make up the user
          experience together. Devices change, and so does the way the user interacts with them. By
          strongly separating data and visualisation / interaction, we do not re-invent the wheel
          but adapt to the requirements and expectations of a device, and about how devices work
          together for the user.

**Running Plasma Active**

<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="40%" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" ><tr >
<td >![](http://vizzzion.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/active-viewpad_thumb.jpg)
</td></tr></table>

We have a basic, Plasma-based shell right now, which runs on three target devices ”
          and probably some more, but that™s what we™ve tested so far. It performs well, runs stable
          and is usable with a touch-screen. While Plasma Tablet is quite fun already, do not expect
          release quality yet, as it is a snapshot of our efforts. Find the download location for
          the Balsam Professional live image on the [wiki](http://community.kde.org/Plasma/Active/Installation#Balsam_Professional_Live_Image).

[open-slx](http://www.open-slx.com) has created a Balsam
          Professional live image based on openSUSE 11.4 running Plasma Active. open-slx (my
          employer) are developing Plasma Active for openSUSE in the openSUSE Build Service. We™ve
          also created packages which can be installed online on top of openSUSE 11.4. You can find
            [installation
            instructions](http://community.kde.org/Plasma/Active/Installation) in our Wiki, also for Meego.

Of course you want to run Plasma Active on a ˜real™ device, we currently recommend
          either the ExoPC (WeTab), the Lenovo Ideapad, or a Viewsonic Viewpad 10. You can find
          instructions for devices in the [Wiki](http://community.kde.org/Plasma/Active/Devices)

**Status**

There is still a long way to go. We™re missing key functionality, default
          applications, optimizations all over the place, and more. There is nothing fundamental
          that holds us back to bringing the full experience users expect to tablet devices, based
          on our well-known, beloved, proven software stack. We are focusing our first release,
          which is planned for September already, on tablet computers. Since fixing a bunch of
          showstoppers over the past two weeks, I™ve actually started using Plasma Active for some
          light reading tasks (mostly web and RSS), and I™ve got to say: It rocks your socks. Being
          able to use a tablet computer which is based on Free software that you created yourself,
          is real fun. I™ve also handed it to friends who came by, and while they understood it™s an
          early prototype, I had a really hard time getting my gadget back. And that is only just
          the beginning. We have an excellent base to build a complete experience upon. In other
          words, it™s the perfect time to jump in and become part of something great and to help it
          also making it something really big.

**Different goals need different processes**

<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="40%" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" ><tr >
<td >![](http://vizzzion.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/plasma-active-snap1-default_thumb.png)
</td></tr></table>

When we put the pieces for Active together, it quickly became clear that if we want to
          succeed, we also have to [rethink](http://vizzzion.org/blog/2011/04/of-rockstars-unicorns-and-isaac-newton/) some of our collaboration processes. One of my pet peeves has always
          been that different essential parts of what the user gets in her hands come from different
          teams. If we want to put something desirable into the hands of our users we need to pull
          in the same direction. While we needed different skills, these skills have to align in how
          they™re applied. This makes communication more natural, leads to a more focused process,
          and ultimately a better result. It™s clear that such an endeavour will only work if enough
          people in our communities, and the communities around it think that this is a worthwhile
          thing to spend their time on, and that we can get the people that do to pull in the same
          direction. The good news, however is that we™ve been able to create a stable platform to
          do this, in terms of tools, processes, collaboration models and not at least software.
          That platform is [**Plasma Active**](http://community.kde.org/Plasma/Active).

**Sounds interesting?**

If you want to help us shape Plasma Active, and bring its vision to reality, we would
          like to invite you. Start with having a look at our list of [tasks](http://community.kde.org/Plasma/Active/Tasks), and if you find
          something you can help with, tell us, [subscribe](https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/active) to the Plasma
          Active mailing list, or join #active on Freenode™s IRC network. We have documented our
          ideas, concepts and processes in the [wiki](http://community.kde.org/Plasma/Active).

In the coming weeks, we will keep you updated about Plasma Active™s progress, and we
          will be able to reveal more of our vision as we give Plasma Active shape by making it
          become reality.

            really makes me think we should go this way.

Ray's comment starting with "Every flicker and mode change in the boot

Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn't
            going to go away. The code itself isn't well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It's only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don't have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

Anonymous web surfing should be only one, I mean one, click away on a default installation of openSUSE. I would love to see a little desktop applet or browser plugin which enables anonymous surfing for the logged in user.


There are various projects out there to help protecting our privacy such as Tor https://www.torproject.org/ and others like proxies and such. These should be nicely integrated into the system, ie. when setting up network there could be a swith "enable anonymous browsing by default" and such. All parts for such an solution are there, just investigation, planning and integration is needed.



Please note that anonymous internet usage is not illegal. Its like sending a letter in an envelope instead of without.

            [system ICC color management](https://features.opensuse.org/312211)
          

Add a colour management system (CMS) for assigning ICC device profiles to device + driver configurations. Starting with the monitor profiles some colour management aware graphics applications can already use this feature. These cover Scribus, Krita, Gimp, Inkscape and some more.
A open source CMS, which has extensive support for setting up ICC profiles for monitors is Oyranos.

Optionally are some more dependencies for CUPS, patched SANE, libraw/exiv2, Qt.
UIs exist as Kolor Manager (KDE control panel) and Synnefo (Qt).
The library is very modular and can simply be removed if needed.

Most packages (except Synnefo) exist in OBS already.

            [deprecate /var/lock](https://features.opensuse.org/312216)
          

/var/lock should be deprecated

    

  * it never was really used properly on SUSE Linux

  * using lockdev didn't really help either as only few programs actually use it and it's not bug free (should be setuid instead of setgid lock)



The suggestion would be to patch programs to use flock() on the device fd instead which would solve all problem wrt permissions ans stale lock files.

The Testing Core Team will meet on Monday, April 11 at 17:00 UTC on our usual IRC
          channel. We will be discussing the Open Bugs Day that was held on Saturday April 2. In
          addition, we will have a post-release discussion of 11.4 to emphasize what was good, and
          what might be improved during the development of 12.1 between now and its release in
          November 2011. 

There was limited participation in Open Bugs Day, with many fewer workers than the
          previous OBD. We are not sure of the reasons. Perhaps our target of bugs from 11.2 and
          older versions did not attract as much interest as the previous effort, when we targeted
          bugs in 11.4. In addition, last Saturday was reported to be a very nice spring day in
          Nuremberg and that some potential participants chose to be outside rather than sitting at
          a computer terminal. Despite the relatively few participants, we updated a large number of
          bugs. Our tool at [http://openbugs.zq1.de/](http://openbugs.zq1.de/)
          found a total of 1179 open bugs for versions up to 11.2. Of these, 365 were updated in the
          Bugzilla pages. Some of these were really old. For example, I found several bugs still
          open from versions 10.0 and 10.1!

Today i've updated Calibre to Version 0.7.53. If you're interested which bugs are fixed or
      which new features are present, you can follow this link. Since a few versions we just can
      provide packages for openSUSE 11.4 and higher. The problem is, that the sourcecode now uses
      functions from newer [python
        versions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search/Python_(programming_language)), who just are present in the 11.4 repositories.

For all, who are not knowing exactly what Calibre is: it is a free opensource[ Ebook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search/E-book)-Reader. Now a little
      Screenshot:

A new service from the Calibre Project now is, a Database of [DRM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search/Digital_rights_management) free
      Ebooks. This Database can found there. All Calibre packages are hosted in the
      Documentation:Tools repository. If you add this into your YaST Repository Manager, you always
      get the last version. Also the last Package can found in openSUSE:Factory Repository.

        on old hardware, and the best thing is: all software comes free of charge.

I want to say first that this is not the only way of setting up such a system. There are
        many ways of achieving this goal but this is the way I take. I do not issue any guarantee
        that this will work for you! (...)

A number of years ago I wrote about the [Merge Sort](http://jeffreystedfast.blogspot.com/2007/02/merge-sort.html)
        algorithm. One of the advantages of Merge Sort is that it
        is a stable sort, meaning that elements that compare as being equal remain in their original
        order after being sorted.

Well, today I had need of employing a stable sorting routine for sorting elements by a
        ZIndex in [Moonlight](http://www.moonlight-project.com). Up until today,
        we had been using qsort() which, while not guaranteed to
        be a stable sort on any platform, happens to be implemented in glibc as a stable sort except in out-of-memory conditions. Since we'd like
        Moonlight to work on platforms other than Linux+glibc (such as Mac OS or BSD), it has become
        important enough to implement properly. (...)

**Introduction**

YaST has a module for the server and the client part of OpenLDAP (plus a very basic LDAP browser / editor).



On SLES11 we had the following problems regarding the use of the YaST module and OpenLDAP server configuration:

    

  * Database version only to store the configuratio (cn=config).

  * No way to set up any replication method or mode using this module.

  * OpenLDAP modules available build in the SLAPD binary.

Then your choices in this SLES11 version:

    

  * Use the configuration file /etc/openldap/slapd.conf but in this case, forget YaST for ever.

  * Use YaST to set up a basic OpenLDAP server then use an external tool to set up the rest.

  * If use of YaST only is mandatory, forget the replication.

An RFE (Request For Enhancements) was created at this time, to be able to set up replication from the YaST module, on SLES11 SP1. They did it! So, let™s check how it works.



**Note**: On SLES11 or SLES11 SP1, by playing with /etc/sysconfig/opendlap, you can use the configuration file (/etc/openldap/slapd.conf) to configure OpenLDAP server but in this case do not use YaST anymore. (...)

You might be used to working with IPv4 on Linux, but like it or not IPv6 is on its way
        in. Roll up your sleeves, spit on your palms, and get ready to go to work because this is
        your crash course in actually using IPv6. It hardly hurts at all. Linux has supported it
        since the 2.1 kernel, so you shouldn't have to install anything. Make sure you have the
        ping6, ip, and ifconfig commands.

Let's get my favorite nitpick out of the way right now ” we do not have IPs, we have IP
        addresses. IP stands for Internet Protocol. As my wise grandmother used to say, sloppy
        speech equals sloppy habits, which equals a trip to hell in a handbasket. (...)

      people. How can we overcome the technical barriers that hold back so many people from
      benefitting from our hard work, all the genius, love and creativity we put into software.
      Since my first contact with Free software, Linux openSUSE and KDE, we have done some very
      solid work. We have technically caught up with Microsoft, and are delivering a product that is
      up to par in many aspects, and better in many more ways. While we have booked immense
      successes, we have not reached the goal of making the Linux desktop ubiquitous in the desktop
      market. In a world of iPhones and Android, we even see closed development models based on
      similar technology as ours being a big success, market-wise, but failing to deliver the full
      Freedom of a community-driven development model to end users. (...)

**One of the new features the recent major release of openSUSE brought
        with it that *really* caught my attention is the ability to turn the distribution into a
        rolling one, effectively bringing it to the camp of the likes of Gentoo and Arch. As a
        former long time user of Gentoo I thought I™d install openSUSE and take it for a drive “ but
        most importantly add the Tumbleweed repo to it and see what happens from
      there.**

[Tumbleweed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumbleweed) is the name of the
      repository that once added to your openSUSE installation allows the whole system to be
      regularly upgraded to the latest and greatest software, without the need of ever upgrading the
      OS to a newer, major version of the distribution. The good news is that latest and
        greatest doesn™t mean bleeding edge. That may be the case with the
      openSUSE Factory repo, but not with Tumbleweed. The bad news is that by turning openSUSE into
      a rolling distro you™ll find yourself re-compiling and re-installing any closed-source drivers
      you rely on more often than you™re probably used to “ and in most cases that entails some
      extra labor. But that couldn™t possibly stop me from trying Tumbleweed, so I set off to a
      quest for transforming a local openSUSE 11.4 VMware VM (GNOME edition) into an installation of
      a rolling distribution. Well, it very soon turned out that I was in for a pretty short yet
      quite enjoyable quest. Before I go any further, I should point out that I™m no openSUSE
      expert. I have used the distribution in the past but it never really won me. Despite that, I
      always enjoy trying out new operating systems in general and Linux distributions in particular
      “ especially when there™s a new version of a popular brand out. I should probably mention here
      that this time around openSUSE left me with an excellent impression and that™s mainly because
      of zypper, the distribution™s command-line tool for package management. (...)

[Andreas Jaeger:
        Versionitis](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/04/06/versionitis/)

The voting on how to do the versioning is over and the old school has won
      by 55 per cent (of 98 participants). Thanks to all that participated in the two votes and the
      discussion around the topic.

As Coolo said in on the [project list](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2011-03/msg00516.html),
      we™d like to make a small change to the numbering:

We will not have a .0 release but only .1, .2, .3 release. Since we have releases in three
      months, the November

release is always the .1 release, the July release the .2 and the March release the
      .3.

So, the plan is that the next release will be called openSUSE 12.1 and launched on the
      10th of November, 2011! Two years later “ on the 14th of November, 2013 “ we will then have
      the openSUSE 13.1 release.

So, the next four releases are called:

  * November 2011: openSUSE 12.1

  * July 2012: openSUSE 12.2

  * March 2013: openSUSE 12.3

  * November 2013: openSUSE 13.1

Detailed results for logged-in openSUSE members are available at the [connect poll page](https://connect.opensuse.org/pg/polls/read/a_jaeger/12979/opensuse-release-versioning) and I have reproduced them here as well:

  * A: old school: Like currently but only counting the right number until 3:

55% (54 votes)

  * B: Fedora style: Just integers:

29 % (28 votes)

  * C: Ubuntu style: YY.MM:

16 % (16 votes)

This is also consistent with the [results of the first public voting](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/03/28/opensuse-release-versioning-poll-on-last-three-options/).

Note that openSUSE does not have a major and minor numbering, even if it seems so. There
      is right now no difference in any way between what we would do for openSUSE 11.4 or 12.0 or
      12.1 “ and no sense to speak about openSUSE 11 or openSUSE 11 family. We also had in the past
      no process on how to name the next release (when to increase which parts of the
      number).

I think this new versioning is still consistent with the old one but also an improvement
      since it™s now clear that we change the first digit every two year. The first poll showed that
      half of our users prefer a date based versioning and the other a consecutive numbering. So,
      depending on your point of view, you can see this as a mixture of both or as consecutive
      numbering ![](http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif)

So, time now to make openSUSE 12.1 a great release!

      Sometimes certain tools get deprecated, or become obsolete (to most of us). Up until openSUSE 11.2 we had to configure the X server -for our graphical desktop- by running SaX2 from the console in runlevel 3. Quite a hurdle for new users. After that autodetection and configuration entered openSUSE, so SaX2 is no longer maintained as a component of a default openSUSE install. This thread is opened by a user who does want SaX2 for a reason. There's another thread announcing SaX3, which should provide some basic functions for the X display server's configuration.

      Here's a user reporting continuous failure of his DVD download. The causes for this can be many, but there's always a way out. Read some good advice, it may save some time.

        [GNOME 3.0 Has Arrived](http://www.gnome.org/news/2011/04/gnome-3-0-has-arrived/)
      

After three years of planning and development, GNOME 3.0 is here. This new version of GNOME delivers an exciting new interface, major improvements under the hood, and enhanced applications. The GNOME release team™s [official announcement](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/devel-announce-list/2011-April/msg00004.html) congratulates and thanks the GNOME community for its hard work on the release:



GNOME 3.0 would not have come to exist without the passion and incessant work of hundreds of people from our community, and without the support of our users. Thanks to the artists, bug triagers, designers, documentors, hackers, packagers, testers, translators and to everybody else who helped us reach this milestone! 

You can read about all the changes in GNOME 3.0 in [the release notes](http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/3.0/), and you can find out more about the background and reception to GNOME 3 in the [official press release](http://www.gnome.org/press/2011/04/gnome-3-0-released-better-for-users-developers-3/).

### Reviews and Essays




        [DesktopLinux: OpenSUSE 11.4 bolstered by Novell services, says review](http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS3982709075.html?kc=rss)
      

OpenSUSE 11.4 is a modest improvement, hobbled by some installation and font-control
        issues, says this eWEEK review. Yet OpenSUSE remains
        compelling thanks to related Novell offerings such as SUSE Studio and OpenSUSE Build
        Service, plus a new Tumbleweed rolling release option and Evergreen long-term support
        project.

Released in early March, [
          OpenSUSE 11.4
        ](http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS3048642267.html) is a modest new release of
        the community-oriented Linux-based operating systems from Novell and the OpenSUSE community,
        marked by a raft of newly updated open source applications and components. As with previous
        OpenSUSE releases, this distribution can serve in roles ranging from desktop to server.
        However, where OpenSUSE once stood tall among its Linux rivals, I'd sooner recommend [
          Ubuntu
        ](http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS3229986802.html) or one of the Red Hat-based distributions for most
        client-to-server uses. (...)

        [Datamation/Matt Hartley: Problems Linux Enthusiasts Refuse to Address](http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/3929866/)
      

I like to think of myself as a relatively long time Linux enthusiast. In fact, I feel like a fish out of water when asked to work on a Windows box or with a Mac.



Like most of you, I can certainly make the adjustment for a day, but I always come away feeling a little stranger from the experience. Guess this happens when you™re bound to a single way of doing things for an extended period of time.



Now let's flip the coin for a moment. Despite the many successes seen from the desktop Linux camp over the years, there are some areas that continue to be left largely unchecked. Rather than automatically painting my findings with a negative brush, instead let's examine each issue closely.



Let™s see if there is in fact a real problem at all. In this article, I™ll tackle specific concerns I™ve noticed and focus on whether these issues present any real concern for us in the long run. (...)
