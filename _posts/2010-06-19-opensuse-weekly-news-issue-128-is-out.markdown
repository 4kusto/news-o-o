<td style="margin: 0pt;" > Welcome to issue # 128 of the [openSUSE Weekly News](http://wiki.opensuse.org/Weekly_news).



What happend in the last week. One of the important things is the release of openSUSE 11.3 RC1. You can download it at [http://software.opensuse.org/developer](http://software.opensuse.org/developer). You are invited to test it. Through the testing you can help to make your favorite distribution better.

The other interesting thing was the call for volunteers to join the German Weekly News team. After the call I got many emails from people who like to work in the team. I would use this opportunity to thank all that responded to call for their willingness to help.

We wish you to enjoy reading !

"As openSUSE 11.3 is around the corner and will be released on July 15, it™s now the right time to prepare your Launch Paty in our city or region. Gnokii just posted on the openSUSE marketing mailing list the following which should help orgainizing such an event and will help to avoid mistakes made already by others.  What™s a Launch Party?  Launch Party means an event around the fresh released openSUSE version. What kind of event is up to the organizator. Its usually an event to spread the word around openSUSE, share knowledge with others and get people on the openSUSE train."  


####  [A Strategy for the openSUSE Project: Proposals and Discussions](https://news.opensuse.org/2010/06/17/a-strategy-for-the-opensuse-project-proposals-and-discussions/)

Each strategy proposal includes the same community statement. We will therefore discuss the community statement and the three strategies separately."

####  [KDE at openSUSE: KDE: Week 23](http://kdeatopensuse.wordpress.com/2010/06/15/kde-week-23/)


"This week I tried to find the reason for yakuake taking >3 seconds before it slides down the first time. I thought that changing the default black text on white ground profile to one with white text on black ground slowed yakuake™s sliding down quite a bit. But that might have been an illusion since changing it back did not improve anything. However I guess that the graphics driver plays a part in this issue since the delay seems shorter on Intel graphics than on Nvidia (binary driver)."

As that openSUSE:Factory now contains Qt4 4.6.3, all targets for KDE4:Unstable are build with the same Qt4 version, which brings a lot of stability and bugfixes.  A few people already indicated that they find the latest version becoming more responsive and that things seems much faster than previous versions. (...)"

####  [#309840: Supress verbose messages after Grub](https://features.opensuse.org/309840)


"In the current bootsplash scenario, after we select the kernel version (or by default starts to boot with the only available kernel), it gives a brief 3-4 second verbose message on the screen.. something on the lines of "Uncompressing Kernel...<and the kernel options parameters>". It then proceeds to the bootsplash screen of openSUSE that we're all familiar with. This is elegantly supressed under Ubuntu through a patch called quiet.diff."  


####  [#309868: ip6 firewall](https://features.opensuse.org/309868)


"I would like to see at least a basic firewall (or packet filter if you prefer) for IPv6 as part of the installation since IPv6 is by default enabled. As soon as your router has IPv6 enabled you are vulnerable without."  


####  [#309914: Add Disk Labels to partitions during install](https://features.opensuse.org/309914)


"This can be very useful when plugging a hdd opensuse was installed on to another machine, eg, via USB. The notifier will display the disk labels without having to guess what is on each partition. Should be fairly simple to implement, and I only expect to be done when separate home partition is selected during install. More partitions than that, and I see it up to the user to define the labels."  


####  [#309930: Link GDM and KDM to their respective manual chapters](https://features.opensuse.org/309930)


"GDM sometimes shows menues at the bottom, sometimes not. A user needs these menus to e.g. switch between KDE and GNOME. The logic, when these menues appear is well documented in GNOME user guide. Having the relevant chapter handy, helps logging in and generally improves usability of the system."  


####  [#309931: Server name/certificate subject validation in EAPOL authentications (NetworkManager)](https://features.opensuse.org/309931)


"We, at the hungarian eduroam community, realized, that the lack of this capability in NetworkManager is a VERY SERIOUS threat. (...)"  


####  [#309995: libzypp: generate posix portable character set filenames](https://features.opensuse.org/309995)


"Quick rationale: Spaces in filenames are EVIL!!!!!! Extended rationale: libzypp should not make assumptions about the filesystem where files and directories may be stored. Some filesystems may choke on the filenames that are currently auto-generated. Further, many tools and scripts which iterate over files and directories implicitly presume that file/directory names don't contain weird characters."  


####  [#309996: zypper download speed up](https://features.opensuse.org/309996)


"Because Zypper is a little slow, and that's preventing a lot of packages from being installed in time. We should be able to have zypper as speedy as possible."

So first up I'll give you a deadline of 1200UTC 17June2010 to get you questions in by. What's the game? Simple, I would like you lot to pretend you are interviewing our prospective Community Manager. Does this sound a bit bitchy to you because I'm no longer in the running? If so I genuinely don't mean it to be.

###  Linux Tag 2010 





####  [Andreas Jaeger: Linuxtag 2010 in Berlin](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/06/12/linuxtag-2010-in-berlin/)


"Thursday morning at 5am I woke up, had a quick breakfirst and travelled via Nürnberg to Berlin for LinuxTag 2010. I arrived around 12:00 at the fair and was surprised to see it the back occupied by around 7 persons. We had a small booth, so it was full. They were taking part in the workshop Build your own multi-distro package held by Michal. The openSUSE boosters had organized these workshops as practical hands-on experience sessions.  Our booth had at the front two large touchscreens were we demoed the current state of openSUSE 11.3. As usual one run GNOME, the other KDE “ and we shared our remaining DVD media and openSUSE stickers. Always a few people were standing around the touchscreens helping people and talking about openSUSE."  


####  [Adrian Schröter: Some LinuxTag 2010 impressions](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/06/13/some-linuxtag-2010-impressions/)


"LinuxTag 2010 has ended, openSUSE had a booth in the community area and we had a number talks. We also released OBS 2.0 on LinuxTag. You know this of course already, but here are some impressions.  openSUSE booth was very well visited. Various workshops and activities created several times actually a big swarm around it. Many people were interessted about OBS in special and I hope we won some more OBS users and developers.  Hennes and mine talk about how to escape the free software hell was provocant enough to get quite some people into our room directly after the keynote. I hope we were able to show off the coolness of OBS there."  


####  [Michael Löffler: Some wrap-up from LinuxTag](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/06/14/some-wrap-up-from-linuxtag/)


"Just traveling back by train from LinuxTag, Berlin to Nürnberg. How was LinuxTag? In general it seems to me that LinuxTag may should change their motto Were .com meets .org as the event changed over the years more and more to an community project events with a few companies attending and a few business visitors passing by. I wonder who™s willing to pay the bill for LinuxTag ongoing? But that™s not of my business. Apart of the trade show the LinuxTag team served a pretty broad and high quality 4 days conference. For the community guys and girls I™d say it was a pretty good event with much conversation and meeting of people you normally just meet on mailingslists, forums or IRC and with a bunch of poeple new or intersted in Linux and open source."  


####  [Sirko Kemter: LinuxTag 2010 - Review](http://karl-tux-stadt.de/ktuxs/?p=2407)


"Last week was the 16th edition of LinuxTag, one of the greatest FLOSS events worldwide. I was there but not as part of openSUSE project. There are some events I cant do that because I am part of RadioTux. LinuxTag is such a event and that means a lot of stress for me. My job on RadioTux is Chief of Program, that means I make the schedule for the broadcasting and take care of a trouble-free broadcasting. We had a lot of interviews at LinuxTag round 16 a day and we had two stages too. One of them was in opposite of our booth and the other one was the Open Source Arena which we had daily for a hour."

"I had been toying with the idea that, to split a file on my hard-disk, I have to read and write to a new file and then truncate the old file. But isn't it lots of unnecessary I/O. I already have all the data on disk. I should be able to change the meta-data alone and mark the file contents after some length as a different file.  So during this hackweek, I implemented 2 system calls on Linux, sys_split and sys_join. And added support for these calls to the FAT file-system. [http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/6/9/200](http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/6/9/200) With this patch one can split a file into 2 or join 2 files without doing much I/O! (...)"  


####  [Holger Hetterich: SMBTAv2 @ Hackweek 2010](http://holger123.wordpress.com/2010/06/14/smbtav2-hackweek-2010/)


"The SMB traffic analyzer software suite (in short SMBTA) is a toolset aimed at visualizing the data flow on one or more Samba servers, providing statistics about the usage of Samba services. The long term goal of the SMB Traffic Analyzer project is to provide a universal remote debugging facility for Samba.  Well, there was Hackweek last week at SUSE again. And like a tradition, the SMBTA team is taking part in that very cool event. Our primary target currently is to release a first version of smbtad and smbtatools, so that we are able to have working tools released until Samba 3.6.0 Preview 1."  


####  [Suresh Jayaraman: Hackweek V: Local caching for CIFS network file system](http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/06/14/hackweek-v-local-caching-for-cifs-network-file-system/)


"It™s that time of the year when SUSE/Novell developers use their Innovation Time-off to do a project of their interest/wish “ called as Hackweek. Last week was Hackweek V. I worked on making the Common Internet File System (CIFS) cache aware, i.e. local caching for CIFS Network File System."  


####  [Jonathan Pryor: HackWeek V](http://www.jprl.com/Blog/archive/development/mono/2010/Jun-15.html)


"Last week was HackWeek V, during which I had small goals, yet had most of the time eaten by unexpected "roadblocks."  The week started with my mis-remembering OptionSet behavior. I had thought that there was a bug with passing options containing DOS paths, as I thought the path would be overly split: (...)"  


####  [Noel Power: My mono Hackweek](http://noelpower.blogs.ie/2010/06/15/my-mono-hackweek/)


"It was hackweek here again in Novell, I spent an enjoyable ( but also sometimes frustrating ) couple of days trying to extend support for Mono in Openoffice.org. Recently on IRC there was some interest in using C# to write extensions for Openoffice.org where it became clear that only being able to ˜drive™ Openoffice.org from C# is severely limiting. To provide decent custom functionality you need to be able to get called by Openoffice.org, integrate with the Menus and Toolbars etc. Clearly to write an extension you need to be able to be ˜plugged™ in.. There are many many C# developers ( and potential extension developers ) and we are just ignoring them. I have to admit I always wanted to play with C#/DotNet/Mono and I even proposed a GSOC task to try and faciliate this ;-) Unfortunately the project didn™t make the cut but fortunately there is Hackweek yay! So, I spent the last couple of days playing around with Mono and C#, first I wrote a new loader for Mono, this allowed me to use recomp to register some services, next I modified unopkg to accept a Mono component bundled in an extension. (...)"  


####  [Lluis Sanchez: Hack Week project: Cydin](http://foodformonkeys.blogspot.com/2010/06/hack-week-project-cydin.html)


"Last week was a Hack Week at Novell, so I spent some time working on a new idea I've been cooking in the past weeks: a Community Add-in Repository for MonoDevelop, which I'm calling Cydin.  The idea is to have a web site where add-in developers can publish their MonoDevelop add-ins and make them available to all users. The site works like a build bot: it pulls the source code of add-ins from version control repositories, builds and packages them, and then publishes them in an add-in repository, to which MonoDevelop will be subscribed."  


####  [SUSE Studio: Hackweek: UuidIt and has_alter_ego. Two itches scratched](http://blog.susestudio.com/2010/06/hackweek-uuidit-and-hasalterego-two.html)


"During last week™s SUSE HackWeek, I worked on solving two problems we recently had in the Ruby on Rails part of SUSE Studio. The first is to easily define unique identifiers, and the second makes it simple to add new configuration to a database.  Assigning UUIDs to your models  Some time ago I was asked if we could add UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifier) to one or two (or three...?) of our models. I first looked at the available gems and plugins for doing that, but they all relied on the fact that the according model has a dedicated column for the UUID. (...)"

As it stands, 11.3 should have an almost fully functional Moblin environment “ I say 'almost' as there were two packages that I just couldn't get to co-operate and build (the modified Moblin browser, and the Web panel).

"LTAF is an integration test framework developed by the Microsoft ASP.NET QA Team. Integration tests are different than unit tests, they actually test what a user would be doing by opening up the browser and filling in textboxes or clicking links. LTAF is nice because you write your tests in C# and run them in the browser of your choice, the disadvantage to this is you can™t have it easily integrate with a continuous integration system like CruiseControl.NET since there is no runner."

" Lizard lovers, get ready. The next openSUSE release is heading your way very soon. After eight months of development, the green team will launch 11.3 in mid-July. Let's take a look at the new and improved openSUSE.  The last openSUSE release came out in November of 2009. It was the last openSUSE release before the project went onto a fixed eight-month release cycle. It's a bit slower than the Ubuntu and Fedora projects but gives a bit more time to work on the release. Lots of good stuff has been developed since 11.2."

"Well, epic for a Free software geek. Kim and other normal people just chuckled, and at best grinned when I told them.  I™m now running openSUSE on my desktop, which has an AMD RadeonHD 4350 card. That card is fast enough for my graphics needs (compositing window management, a dated game once in a while) and still passively cooled and providing two DVI outputs for my dualhead setup. I™ve been using an NVidia VGA before, but switched to AMD/ATi when I last upgraded my desktop workstation (to an Intel Quad core, meaning new mobo, graphics as well). I picked a RadeonHD card instead of an NVidia chip because of AMD™s open dealing with specs, something which I deeply despise in NVidia. So, NVidia, there you go: You lost me as customer because you™re too closed a company."
